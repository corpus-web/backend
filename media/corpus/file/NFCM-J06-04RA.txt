Abstract
In this paper, the thorium uptake from aqueous solution using SA/PVA/PEO/ZSM5 nanohybrid adsorbent has been investigated. The effect of zeolite content, pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature parameters was scrutinized. Using adsorbent containing 10 wt% zeolite and at pH 5 and 45 °C, the highest uptake of thorium (139.2 mg g−1) occurred. Kinetic studies have shown that the process of thorium uptake follows the double-exponential kinetic model. Using different isothermal models, uptake isotherm was studied. The results showed that the thorium uptake onto the adsorbent is physical, spontaneous and endothermic reaction.
Introduction
As the importance of energy in the world has become more evident, attention to nuclear energy has also increased [1]. Uranium is the main element for nuclear energy production [2, 3]. As uranium resources dwindle, awareness to thorium as a new fuel has increased [4, 5]. Thorium is a dangerous element for human health [6]. With the rise of research on thorium, effluents containing thorium have been produced from which thorium must be removed.
Various techniques have been studied so far for the separation of thorium ions from effluents, including solvent extraction [7], liquid membrane [5], chemical precipitation [8], ultrafiltration [9], electrodialysis and electrodeionization (EDI) [10], ion exchange [11], and adsorption [12,13,14,15].
Adsorption is a simple, cost-effective, high-yield, and flexible method. Absorbent properties affect uptake efficiency, contact time, and reuse [16,17,18]. Research has shown that zeolites have a high ability to remove heavy elements from effluents due to their high specific surface area and hydroxyl groups [19,20,21]. Zeolites are divided into two categories, natural and synthetic. ZSM5 has been introduced as a synthetic zeolite [22,23,24,25].
However, the separation of ions from colloidal solutions always has many problems. Therefore, polymer bases are used to improve the adsorbent properties. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of these bases, which reduces the specific surface area. To solve this problem, we can also use materials called cavity manufacturers, in which polyethylene oxide (PEO) has been used. Also, the presence of sodium alginate as a biopolymer adsorbent that has a significant ability to absorb heavy metals can improve adsorbent performance [26]. So far, various studies have been reported to uptake different elements using adsorbents prepared from PVA and zeolite [27,28,29,30,31,32].
The principal objective of this article was to investigate the uptake of thorium utilizing sodium alginate (SA)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/polyethylene oxide (PEO)/ZSM5 zeolite (SA/PVA/PEO/ZSM5) nanohybrid adsorbent. The impact of zeolite content, contact time, initial acidity, adsorbent dose, initial concentration of thorium solution, and temperature on the uptake process has been studied. Thorium uptake kinetics was scrutinized utilizing pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and two-exponential kinetic equations. Uptake isotherm was also investigated using different models, and thermodynamic parameters were obtained.
Materials and methods
Materials
The research utilized hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium alginate (SA), polyethylene oxide (PEO), and ZSM5 zeolite purchased from Merck company. The solution of thorium ions is also made by dissolving a certain amount Th(NO3)4.4H2O (Merck) in deionized water.
Experimental measurements
The acidity of solutions was measured by pH meter (827-pH lab, Switzerland). The concentration of thorium ions in the solutions was determined with Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, VARIAN, LIBERTY150AX TURBO, Australia).
Preparation of SA/PVA/PEO/ZSM5 nanohybrid absorbent
In this study, the nanohybrid adsorbent was developed by the casting technique [27]. 2 g of PEO and 2 g of PVA were dissolved in 20 mL H2O for 260 min at 80 °C in two separate dishes. It was placed at ambient temperature for 12 h and then mixed to form a polymer solution (A).
Also, 0.6 g of SA was dissolved in 20 mL H2O for 120 min at 50 °C and then added to the solution (A) and was stirred for 120 min and thus, the solution of polymer/SA, solution (B) was made.
Different percentages of ZSM5 were added to the solution (B) and were placed in a Petri dish after 120 min of stirring in an ultrasonic mixer. Finally, it was dried for 72 h to produce the nanohybrid adsorbent.
In the previous study [27], the characteristics of this adsorbent were determined using SEM, BET, and FTIR. SEM images demonstrated that the presence of zeolite content less than 10 wt% causes adsorbent cracking and more zeolite content causes non-uniformity of the adsorbent. Using BET analysis, the specific surface area, average pore diameter, and average pore volume of adsorbent were determined to be 7.26 m2 gr−1, 3.09 nm, and 0.013 cm3 gr−1, respectively. The functional groups in the adsorbent were determined by FTIR analysis. The FTIR results indicated that the loading of zeolite nanoparticles has been well conducted in the structure of nanohybrid adsorbent.
Uptake experiments
The thorium uptake experiments were carried out in the Erlenmeyer flask at 25 °C and 200 rpm. The solution acidity was adjusted by 0.1 mol L−1 HCl or 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH. The thorium uptake capacity was determined as follows:
qe=(C0−Ce)m/V
(1)
where C0 and Ce, V, M, and qe are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of thorium, the solution volume, dry mass of adsorbents, and equilibrium uptake of ion, respectively. All uptake experiments were performed twice and its average was reported.
Nonlinear regression analysis
The parameters of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models were determined using nonlinear regression of MATLAB software. The correlation coefficient (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated. The lower RMSEs show, the better the data fitting. The RMSE value is obtained from the following formula:
RMSE=(1n−2)∑i=1n(qi,exp−qi,cal)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
(2)
where n, qi,exp, and qi,cal are the number of samples tested, experimental uptake, and the calculated uptake from the isotherm or the corresponding uptake kinetics, respectively.
Results and discussion
The effect of zeolite content
The impact of ZSM5 content in the nanohybrid adsorbent structure (0–20 wt%) on the thorium uptake was studied. The results illustrated in Fig. 1. With an increase in ZSM5 content up to 10 wt%, the thorium uptake enhanced to 72.3 mg g−1 and then decreased. The presence of ZSM5 in the polymer matrix increases the surface-to-volume ratio adsorbent [27, 33]. Then, as zeolites increase, the particles stick together, reducing the penetration of thorium ions into the adsorbent.
The effect of initial acidity
The impact of initial acidity on the uptake of thorium metal was investigated. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 2. As the pH increased from 2 to 5, the uptake increased from 13 to 72.3 mg g−1. At low pHs, such as 1 to 4, there is a competition between hydrogen ions and thorium ions, which reduces uptake. Also, anionic ligands are hydrogenated, resulting in reduced cations uptake. As the pH increases, the positive charge density on the active sites presents in the adsorbent surface decreases, and the uptake increases. At pH above 5, the formation of large complexes causes a small reduction in uptake. The pH = 5 was selected as the optimal acidity.

The effect of adsorbent dose
The adsorbent dose impact (0.2–1.8 g L−1) on the thorium uptake was scrutinized. The results are shown in Fig. 3. As the adsorbent increases from 0.2 to 1 g L−1, the metal ion uptake enhances its own to the available sites increment. Then, by an increase in adsorbent dose from 1 to 1.8 g L−1, the uptake of the ions decreases own to the remaining unsaturated sites during the uptake process and the reduction of metal ions’ access to the remaining sites. Therefore, the adsorbent dose in all uptake experiments was considered 1 g L−1.

The effect of contact time and kinetic studies
The impact of contact time on the uptake by nanohybrid adsorbent was studied. The results are presented in Fig. 4. As expected, the uptake capacity of adsorbent initially enhanced and gradually decreased to reach equilibrium. The uptake kinetics is composed of two steps: fast and slow. At first, rapid uptake occurs due to the presence of empty sites in the adsorbent. After rapid uptake, the penetration of thorium ions into the adsorbent begins which occurs slowly and is a factor in rate control. Much of the uptake of thorium is done in the first 120 min, and the uptake process is equilibrated after 150 min.

The thorium uptake kinetic data were scrutinized according to the following formulas using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and double-exponential kinetic models [34,35,36].
qt=qe (1−e−k1t)
(3)
qt=q2ek2t1+qek2t
(4)
qt=qe−D1VMexp(−kD1t)−D2VMexp(−kD2t)
(5)
where qt and qe, k, D1, and D2 are uptake capacity at time t and equilibrium time, kinetic constant, the rate constants of the fast and slow steps, respectively.
The results of kinetic studies are presented in Table 1. Comparing R2 and RMSE, it shows that the Double-exponential model is better than the other two models (R2 = 0.9958 and RMSE = 1.11), which shows that both internal and external influences are effective in thorium uptake by the adsorbent. It is also observed that the Pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.9868 and RMSE = 1.67) has a better fit than the Pseudo-first-order model (R2 = 0.9446 and RMSE = 3.43), which indicates that the intensity of filling the uptake centers with the square of the number of empty uptake centers is proportional.

The effect of initial concentration and temperature
The effect of initial concentrations of thorium ions (10–500 mg L−1) at three temperatures (25, 35, and 45 °C) on the thorium uptake scrutinized. The results are presented in Fig. 5. As the concentration of thorium increased from 10 to 400 mg L−1, the uptake capacity of thorium increased from 9 to 136 mg g−1, and higher concentrations, it reached an almost constant value due to the saturation of the adsorbent sites.

The results illustrated that uptake reaction is endothermic, and an increase in temperature increases the uptake capacity of the thorium. The Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG°) and entropy changes (ΔS°), and enthalpy change (ΔH°) was determined by the following equation:
lnKd=−ΔGoRT=ΔSoR−ΔHoRT
(6)
The Kd is the distribution factor and calculated as below:
Kd=C0−CeCe
(7)
The Van’t Hoff diagram for the thorium uptake is illustrated in Fig. 6, using which the thermodynamic parameters shown in Table 2 are obtained. The ΔS° has been obtained for the positive uptake process, demonstrating an increase in irregularity in the solid-solution boundary layer. Also, the positive and negative values of the ΔH° and ΔG° indicate the endothermic and spontaneous reaction. The amount of ΔH° is less than 40 kJ mol−1, it indicates that the adsorption is physical and the force between the ion and the adsorbent is weak van der Waals or electrostatic forces [37, 38].

Uptake isotherm models studies
The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models explain the nature and mode of ions uptake onto the adsorbent. The mathematical expressions of these models are expressed in the following equations [39,40,41]:
qe=qLKLCe1+KLCe
(8)
qe=KFC1/ne
(9)
qe=qD−Rexp(−KD−R[RTln(1+1Ce)]2)
(10)
where KL, KF, and KD-R are these models constants. The qe, qL, and qD-R uptake capacity at equilibrium, Langmuir maximum uptake capacity, and theoretical isotherm saturation capacity, respectively. The n denotes the deviation from the linearity of uptake. The T, R, and Ce are temperature, universal gas constant, and the equilibrium concentration of ions, respectively.
The nonlinear results isotherms models are presented in Table 3. The results demonstrated that the data fitting with the Langmuir model is better than the other models. Therefore, it is concluded that the uptake will be monolayer, and the adsorbent surface is homogeneous. It also increases with increasing KL temperature, which indicates that uptake increases with increasing temperature. All RL values are between 0 and 1, indicating favorable uptake by the adsorbent.
Table 3 The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models parameters for thorium uptake with SA/PVA/PEO/ZSM5 nanohybrid at different temperatures
In the Freundlich model, the n values greater than one at all temperatures show a high affinity for thorium uptake.
Thanks to the KD-R, the type of ion uptake (chemical or physical) is typically determined based on the concept of mean free energy per ion species (E), which is obtained from the following equation:
E=12KD−R−−−−−−√
(11)
The E was less than 8 kJ mol−1, showing that the uptake is a physical process [42]. The results of Table 3 demonstrate that the maximum thorium uptake enhanced with increasing temperature from 25 to 45 °C, from 132 to 139.2 mg g−1.
In Table 4, the thermodynamic parameters and the uptake of thorium by the adsorbent prepared in the present study are compared with other published studies. The adsorbent produced in this work has a good uptake capacity.

Conclusions
In this article, the uptake of thorium from the aqueous solution was performed using A/PVA/PEO/ZSM5 nanohybrid adsorbent. The effect of essential parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial ion concentration, and temperature on the thorium uptake by the adsorbents was scrutinized. The results showed that the maximum thorium uptake occurred at pH 5, the contact time of 180 min, adsorbent content of 1 g L−1, and 45 °C.
Modeling experimental kinetic data illustrated that the thorium uptake process involved two fast and slow steps and the two-exponential kinetic model has the best fit to the experimental data.
The equilibrium data modeling results illustrated that the adsorbent surface is considered homogeneous uptake energy. The maximum uptake capacity of thorium ions was 139.2 mg g−1 at a pH of 5.0 and a temperature of 45 °C. The n values in the Freundlich model and values 0–1 RL in the Langmuir model for thorium uptake indicate a high affinity for the thorium uptake. Also, the results showed that the dominant thorium uptake mechanism is physical. The ΔG° values between −20 and 0 kJ mol−1, as well as positive ΔH values between 2 and 25 kJ mol−1 indicated the uptake reaction is spontaneous and endothermic. Positive values of ΔS° showed that the irregularity in the solid-soluble boundary layer increases.
