Summary
In this research, the hydroxyapatite (HAp) could be directly deposited on carbon black (CB), which was the modified surface to generate more OH− free radicals to strengthen the bond between HAp and CB, before adding ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O) to engage the ion exchange with Fe2+ and Ca2+ to obtain FeHAp-CB composites. The Pt nanoparticles were then reduced on the FeHAp-CB composite surface to derive a Pt/FeHAp-CB catalyst of dual function. The catalyst revealed a steep desorption peak at −0.180 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a hydrogen oxidation reaction ascribed to the characteristics of Pt (110) facet and the CO detoxication function in the methanol oxidation reaction. The superior performance of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalyst was apparently related to the Pt (110) surface, the Fe concentration, and the homogeneous dispersion of Pt particles on the FeHAp-CB composites. And, the ratio of coexisting Pt0 and Pt2+ within Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalyst would definitely affect chemical stability and mass activity. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it was found that a high quantity of Pt0 could improve mass activity, while a high quantity of Pt2+ contributed to chemical stability.
1 INTRODUCTION
In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in hydroxyapatite (HAp), which is the major component in human hard tissue and has been applied to bones and synthesis of bioceramics.1-3 In addition, such as Ag, Ni, and Cu supported on HAp have been widely used as novel catalysts.4-6 Its structure is very good flexibility and high ion-exchange capacity if the charge balance is maintained.7 Besides, Ca cations in the HAp structure can be substituted by metal cations and can incorporate a wide variety of possible cationic and anionic substitutions (eg, Mg2+ and Ni2+).
These properties have been utilized in many applications such as optics, industrial pollution waste, biomedical science, radioactive, and catalysis.8-10 Khachani and coworkers11 successfully synthesized the iron exchanged when Fe3+ ions are distributed in HAp in the aqueous medium, thereby increasing the activity of the catalyst. It was shown that addition of Cu2+ and Fe3+ can be easily realized by exploiting the exchange properties of HAp to obtain Fe/HAp and Cu/HAp.12
In previous reports, the iron phosphate FePO4 has been applied in catalysis, energy conversion, biomedical, and other important application. It showed good performance for catalytic reactions of methane into oxygenates.13, 14 It was found that the improvement of catalytic efficiency was due to a redox mechanism of Fe.15, 16 A direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is a portable fuel cell known for its relatively low operating temperature and high energy density of methanol, where the fuel can be directly oxidized on the anode catalyst to yield high energy converting efficiency.17 Noble metals such as Pt, Ru, and Pd composite catalysts supported on the anode have been widely studied in the DMFC.18 However, the methanol crossover from anode to cathode compartment, the formation of carbon monoxide, poisoning the noble metal electrodes, and the high cost of Pt are the major problems. Therefore, massive efforts have been poured into the research and development of low-cost and high-efficient catalysts using nonnoble metals.19-21 The previous research has documented that the Pt surface with (110) orientation has shown the higher current density22 than (111) and (100) orientation. There is no adsorption formate on Pt (110) in the potential region examined.23-25
The order of activity of Pt (hkl) in alkaline or acid solution increased in the sequence (111) < (100) < (110) for the voltammograms of hydrogen reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).26, 27 However, when the Pt nanoparticles are synthesized on the carbon blacks (CBs), three low index planes appear on the Pt catalysts. Therefore, how to prepare nanosized Pt with (110) facet becomes a very important issue in this field.
In this research, the HAp was directly deposited on CB, which was previously a modified surface to generate more OH− free radicals strengthening the bond between HAp and CB, before adding ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O) to proceed with Fe ion exchange to form FeHAp-CB. Lastly, Pt was then reduced to FeHAp-CB and used to develop the Pt/FeHAp-CB catalyst with a Pt (110) surface. By using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and comparing curves of best fit, ratios of Pt0 and Pt2+ can be determined for chemical stability and mass activity, as well as electrochemical surface area (ECSA), MOR, and CO stripping.
2 EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Catalysts preparation
A total of 0.2 g of CB (Vulcan XC-72) powder was added to a 500-mL deionized water with 10 wt% H2O2 (Union Chemical works LTD.) and ultrasonically stirred for an hour. 14.5M NH4OH (SHOWA) was added through a pipette to adjust and maintain pH of 10.6 to 10.8. Then, the CB solution was continuously stirred with a magnetic mixer for 20 hours, before 0.2M Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (SHOWA) and 0.12M H3PO4 (SHOWA) were added to allow direct deposition of HAp on CB. Finally, the prepared powders were washed and filtered three times, then baked in oven at 55°C for 3 hours. By tuning the weights of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and H3PO4, the three weight ratios of HAp to CB powder were 0.5:1, 3:1, and 10:1, which were also assigned as HAp-CB1, HAp-CB2, and HAp-CB3, respectively.
A total of 0.13 g each of dried HAp-CB1, HAp-CB2, and HAp-CB3 powder was, respectively, added to a 3.95mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O (SHOWA) heated aqueous solution at 78°C. Once stirred for 20 minutes, Ca2+ was replaced by Fe2+, and FeHAp-CB1, FeHAp-CB2, and FeHAp-CB3 were obtained
Subsequently, a 1.5mM H2PtCl6 (ACS, Premion) solution and 10.97mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) were added in for 30 minutes of stirring and another 3 hours of stirring at boiling temperature with an addition of 100 mL of ethanol, for further reducing Pt ions on FeHAp-CB. After filtering three times and drying at 55°C for 8 hours, the catalysts, Pt/FeHAp-CB1, Pt/FeHAp-CB2, and Pt/FeHAp-CB3 were obtained.
2.2 Characterization of materials
2.2.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), (DIGILAB FTX3500 PerkinElmer) was used to check if hydroxyl bonds or others were formed on the modified surface CB after oxidation by H2O2.
2.2.2 The crystallinity, morphology, and microstructure
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a Mac Science MO3x-HFDiffraction. Diffraction patterns were recorded with Cu Kα radiation (30 mA, 40 KV) over a 2θ range of 10° to 90° and scanning speed of 1° min−1. The microstructure results were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and were carried out in a JEOL JSM-6700F. The morphology, crystal orientation, and particle size of Pt in Pt/FeHAp-CB and/or HAp in HAp-CB were obtained with a FETEM-Live FET, (JEOL JEM-2100F).
2.2.3 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and XPS
A total of 0.02 g sample mixed with 2 mL HNO3, 2 mL HCl, and 1 mL HF heated to 170°C for 6 hours and then diluted into 50 mL with D.I. water for accurate compositions of Pt, Ca, Fe, and P elements in the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Perkin Elmer, SCIEX ELAN 5000). The samples were analyzed by XPS on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe with un-monochromated Al Kα radiation (400 W)
2.3 Cell preparations and measurements
A total of 0.02 g of Pt/FeHAp-CB catalyst powder, 0.6 mL of 5 wt% Nafion (Dupont) solution, and 0.05 mL of 95 wt% ethanol as the dispersant were mixed with 0.04 g of CB powder to be ultrasonically mixed to obtain the Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalyst mixture. By using a micropipette, 2 μL of catalyst was brush-painted on the surfaces of a screen-printed electrode (SE101 with area 0.192 cm2) to complete a functional testing electrode.
VERSASTAT III (EG&G Princeton Applied Research) was used to carry out the cyclic voltammetries in a three-electrode cell. The screen-printed electrode (SE101) was used as the working electrode. The platinum wire and the saturated Ag/AgCl were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively.
For the electrochemical test, the potential of the working electrode was cycled between −0.2 and 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl/ saturated KCl) at a scanning rate of 10 mVs−1 in 1M of N2-purged H2SO4 solution for the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests of catalysts. The electrochemical stability was investigated by conducting the CV test for 1000 cycles in succession.
For the MOR test, the potential was cycled at a scanning rate of 50 mVs−1 between 0 to 1 V (vs Ag/AgCl/ saturated KCl) in the mixture of 1M of CH3OH and 1M of H2SO4. After 100 cycles, all CV curves were recorded to observe any sign of CO poisoning.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Characterization of catalysts
3.1.1 FTIR analysis
FTIR diagrams of original and surface-altered CB were shown in Figure 1. After 20 hours of oxidation by 10 wt% H2O2, the surface-modified CB revealed more OH extensions at around 3000 to 3750 cm−1 than the original (unmodified) CB. Plus, adsorption peaks of OH were also observed at 3446, 1636, and 1386 cm−1. Likely, carboxyl anhydride, lactone, phenol, and carboxyl acid could be formed after surface modification of CB. However, quinone and cyclic peroxide should be excluded since they had no OH or CO bond.

3.1.2 X-ray diffraction
The XRD pattern of HAp powder exhibited peaks corresponding to the reference pattern (JCPD 9-432) of HAp. Figure 2B showed the XRD patterns of HAp-CB 2θ at 25.92° (002), 31.80° (211), 32.22° (112), 39.83° (30), 46.72° (222), 49.50° (213), 53.17° (004), and 64.10° (304), corresponding to each crystal plane of HA peak in JCPDS card No.9-432.

After ion exchange with Fe2+ from the addition of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)·H2O, FeHAp-CB composite revealed similar structure to HAp, while the intensity of the surface at 31.80° (211) was reduced, as shown in Figure 2D. In other words, the HAp crystal structure was damaged during the Fe2+ ion exchange, and further obliterated by the addition of H2PtCl6 solution, as shown in Figure 2E.
Only a broad peak in correspondence with the amorphous structure was found at around 23°, However, the addition of H2PtCl6 (pH 1.8) destroys the crystallinity of HAp, leading to ambiguous diffraction peaks. Furthermore, some diffraction peaks of platinum for surfaces (111), (200), (220), and (311) were observed at 39.96°, 46.82°, 68.63°, and 81.67°, which were consistent with JCPDS card No.87-647 for Pt. The Scherrer equation could be used to evaluate the average particle size and the Brag equation to estimate the planar spacing of (111) of Pt catalysts as follows28:
@(1)
@(2)
where dXRD is the average particle sizes (nm), λ the wave-length of X-ray radiation (0.1540 nm), θ is the angle at the position of the peak maximum, β1/2 is the full width (in radians) at half maximum, d111 is the planar spacing (nm) of (111) and 2θ is the diffraction angle of (111).
The average sizes of Pt particles in Pt/FeHAp-CB1, Pt/FeHAp-CB2 and Pt/FeHAp-CB3 catalysts were calculated as 6.6, 4.5, and 5.6 nm, respectively. The planar spacing of (111) was slightly greater than that of Pt in JCPDS card No.87-647, possibly due to a difference between nanosized particles and the bulk. XRD is well known for measuring the average crystal size, and TEM can help to observe the individual particle size of several grains, either coalesced locally or directly, which would also result in bigger particle size in XRD analysis than that of TEM.
3.1.3 FE-SEM observation
The catalysts such as HAp-CB2, FeHAp-CB2, and Pt/FeHAp-CB2 observed under FE-SEM were, respectively, shown in Figure 3A to C. Surface-modified CB particles will gather into clusters by attracting Ca2+ and PO43− in Ca(NO3)2 and H3PO4 through OH bonds.
Figure 3

Since it attracts Ca2+ and PO43− in Ca(NO3)2 and H3PO4 to enhance the precipitation of HAp on CB, it forms HAp-CB2 as shown in Figure 3A. After the addition of 3.95mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O, FeHAp-CB2 composites revealed smaller particles on CB as shown in Figure 3B, indicating slight destruction to the HAp structure in consistence with the XRD result.
After Pt was reduced on the FeHAp-CB2 carrier (substrate), the overall structure was loosened, as shown in Figure 3C, suggesting corrosive effect of low pH H2PtCl6 solution on the composite. However, the remaining carriers (substrates) were protected by an amorphous iron phosphate layer derived from the ion-exchange process. The observed phenomena on HAp-CB1 and HAp-CB3 were also similar to HAp-CB2.
3.1.4 Field-emission transmission electron microscope observation
Images of HAp-CB2 were converted through Live-Fast Fourier Transformation, where differences between CB and HAp could be clearly distinguished, as illustrated in Figure 4A. Once Pt was reduced on the surface of HAp-CB, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of Pt/FeHAp-CB1 and Pt/FeHAp-CB2 were illustrated in Figure 4B,C, respectively. Apparently, Pt dispersion on the latter was better than the former, where Pt, HAp, and CB could be clearly differentiated at higher magnification for Pt/FeHAp and CB. The higher ratio of Pt agglomeration in Pt/HAp-CB1, reflected by the latter electrochemical tests of ECSA, also suggested a poorer performance than that of Pt/HAp-CB2.
Figure 4
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of A, hydroxyapatite (HAp)-CB2 complied with the Live FET of the marked area; B, Pt/FeHAp-CB1 complied with the related lattice image at higher magnification; C, Pt/FeHAp-CB2 complied with the related lattice image at higher magnification; D, Pt/FeHAp particles without carbon black (CB) supports Live-FET of red marked area for Pt/FeHAp-CB3
There were more Pt/FeHAp particles without the CB carrier (substrate) in Pt/FeHAp-CB3, where Live-FFT at the position marked by a red box Figure 4A revealed diffraction points of Pt on (111) and (200), as well as diffraction points of HAp on (200), (210), and (300), which implied the incident ray travel along the direction of Pt (110) and HAp (002) indicated a closer/stronger bond between Pt and HAp. In other words, the precipitation of Pt was possibly related to the FeHAp-CB as the carrier (substrate). A consistent result derived from the deviation of planar spacing analyzed by XRD. However, a slight expansion of planar spacings of (111) and (200) was noted by the Live-FFT measurement.
Moreover, it was also found that the average d111 of Pt particle size (0.226-0.231 nm) was greater than 0.2258 nm in JCPDS card NO.87-940 and would increase with increasing amounts of HAp, which could possibly be a phenomenon due to nanosized effects. Pt nanoparticles on HAp could merely be oriented in thin films of a few layers of atoms, which were compressed flatter than other Pt/HAp combinations due to the coherence with a HAp base matrix, hence the larger Pt d111 than usual.
The mean diameter of Pt particles, d was calculated by Equation (3).29

where ni is the frequency of occurrence of particles of size di observed by the TEM. The mean particle sizes were 4.01 ± 1.02, 4.22 ± 1.21 and 4.42 ± 1.33 for Pt/FeHAp-CB1, Pt/FeHAp-CB2 and Pt/FeHAp-CB3, respectively. The majority of Pt particle sizes was confined to 2 to 5 nm.
3.1.5 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
The compositions of supports and catalysts determined by ICP-MS are indicated in Table 1. The calculated Ca/P ratio of HAp was 1.45 for HAp-CB1 and HAp-CB3, suggesting that they were calcium-deficient HAp, while the result of 1.69 for HAp-CB2 was close to the stoichiometric ratio of 1.67. When ion exchange with Fe2+ occurred, the Ca2+ level was reduced, but the ratio of (Ca + Fe)/P was increased to 2.1, implying that an iron compound instead of phosphate was formed.

a Calculated Pt by assuming 100% reduction.
Once Pt was reduced on the surface of HAp-CB, the Pt levels of Pt/FeHAp-CB1, Pt/FeHAp-CB2, and Pt/FeHAp-CB3 were 18.13, 28.44, and 31.23 wt%, respectively. The ratio of (Ca + Fe)/P was found to reduce from 2.10 to 1.63 and Ca, from 28.34 to 0.57 (at %) in Pt/FeHAp-CB2, indicating that a nonphosphate iron compound was easily etched away by H2PtCl6. A similar result was found for Pt/FeHAp-CB1, where a higher ratio of (Ca + Fe)/P from 2.56 to 1.95 suggested that some iron compound instead of phosphates, such as direct hydroxide development on the CB, were noted, since limited HAp could not completely cover the CB.
On the other hand, the level of Ca was reduced from 47.1 to 22.7 (at %), suggesting a large quantity of residual calcium phosphate remained on Pt/FeHAp-CB3. These results also agreed with the trend of Pt level because platinum particles were more likely to precipitate on HAp as discussed in previous observations under field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM.) The remaining Fe ions in the solution could continuously exchange with HAp to cause an increase in iron of Pt/FeHAp-CB3.
The ICP-MS analysis revealed that the Fe/Ca ratio in Pt/FeHAp-CB was more than that in FeHAp-CB. The result explained that H2PtCl6 solution could easily etch HAp more than the ion-exchanged FeHAp. It was speculated that once HAp and iron phosphate were deposited on the CB, the addition of H2PtCl6 could then seriously damage the carrier (substrate) that only the adsorbed Fe on the CB could continue the ion exchange with Pt.
Plus, the Pt level, as suggested by ICP-MS analysis, was lower than the theoretical value. Since Pt/Pta < 1, the possible two reasons were (a) Pt ions were reduced on the wall of the reaction container, instead of the FeHAp-CB carrier (substrate), and (b) collection through filter paper might accidentally lose some Pt catalyst.
We established a model for investigation based on FTIR, ICP-MS, and TEM results, as seen in Figure 5. Since the modified CB generated more OH− radicals for strengthening the bond between HAp and CB, it was much easier to form FeHAp-CB when (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O was added for ion exchange of Fe2+ and Ca2+.
Figure 5
The model illustrating the process of forming Pt/FeHAp-CB catalysts for three ratios of hydroxyapatite (HAp) to carbon black (CB) A, 0.5:1; B, 3:1; C, 10:1
In FeHAp-CB1, as shown in Figure 5A, the formation of FeHAp-CB was not complete, since there was inadequate HAp. The generation of CB-Fe hydroxide was not sufficient after the addition of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O in the process. This argument was supported by the much higher ratio of (Ca + Fe)/P, compared with the other two composites, as listed in Table 1.
In FeHAp-CB2, as shown in Figure 5B, the additional concentration of HAp was adequate to completely cover the CB to complete the ion exchange Ca2+ and Fe2+ to form more iron phosphates, which were not easily etched away by H2PtCl6. However, the ion exchange only occurred on the surface of HAp, that thicker area was susceptible to etching to leave only a thin layer of FeHAp after the addition of H2PtCl6.
In FeHAp-CB3, excessive HAp was added to further precipitate independent HAp particles in the solution, as shown in Figure 5C.
3.1.6 Chemical states of platinum and iron
The chemical states of Pt and Fe on the carrier (substrate) would be tested by the photoelectron spectrum under X-ray, as shown in Figure 6A. The vertical lines represented the standard samples of Pt and Fe.
Figure 6

The binding energy peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were found around 711.10 to 710.69 eV and 724.91 to 723.87 eV, respectively, as shown in Figure 6A, and the carrier was thus composed of Fe2+ and Fe3+.30-32 As analyzed by fitting the curves obtained from the XPS spectra, the integral area ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ around the Fe 2p3/2 peak were close to 1:1 for Pt/FeHAP-CB3, Pt/FeHAP-CB2 and Pt/FeHAP-CB1.
Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 of Pt/FeHAp-CB were identified as a zero-valence metallic Pt phase (with peaks at 70.8 and 74.1 eV).33, 34 The binding energies of Pt2+ for both were 72.4 and 75.7 eV, as seen in Figure 6B. Ethanol added during the preparation of the catalyst would further reduce the remaining Pt4+ and Pt2+ ions in solution, either replaced Pt2+ with Pt0 or reduced Pt0 on the carrier (substrate) for precipitation and accumulation. The overall integral area ratio of Pt0 in the satellite peak value of catalyst was more than Pt2+, as shown in Figure 6B. It proved that ethanol has further reduced Pt2+ in favor of Pt0. The order of integral area ratios for Pt0 to Pt0 + Pt2+, as listed in Table 2, was Pt/FeHAp-CB3 > Pt/FeHAp-CB2 > Pt/FeHAp-CB1, indicating that the more FeHAp the more precipitation sites are for Pt0. In other words, the more Fe2+ in FeHAp the more capability of reducing Pt2+ into Pt0 is.

The result confirmed the coexistence of Fe2+, Fe3+, Ca2+, Pt0, and Pt2+ in the synthesized Pt/FeHAp-CB composites, as previously shown in the XRD patterns.
Moreover, Figure 6C showed a series of XPS of C 1s in Pt/FeHAp-CB. The intensity significantly decreased with the increasing ratio of HAp to CB, consistent with the model illustrated in Figure 5.
The concentrations of Pt4+, Pt2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ at equilibrium could be estimated by the Nernst equation in the following oxidation-reduction

where A is the initial concentration of Pt4+ (1.499 × 10−3M), B is the initial concentration of Fe2+ (4.47 × 10−2M), and the calculated X is 1.359 × 10−3M. It indicated that most of Pt4+ has been reduced to Pt2+ and part of Fe2+ oxidized to Fe3+.
3.2 Electrochemical performance of Pt/FeHAp-CB
Lastly, the series of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalysts were CV tested. As seen in CV diagrams, as shown in Figure 7, the integral of charge of hydrogen desorption (QH) and the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) were evaluated as follows35:

When Pt/FeHAp-CB catalysts were mixed with two times the weight of CB, the weight percentage of Pt became one-third. The related Pt loading, ECSA, and retained mass activity for a series of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalysts after 1000 cycles were indicated in Table 3.

The Pt/FeHAp-CB catalysts powder were mixed with CB to obtain the Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB ones, the hydrogen desorption peaks of all Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB were found around −0.180 V, primarily contributed by Pt (110), while the broader area on the right on CB all revealed characteristics of Pt (111) and Pt (100), as illustrated in Figure 7A the representative cyclic 10th voltammograms. It was speculated that when Pt2+ replaced Fe2+ or Ca2+ in Pt-FeHAp-CB, the reaction produces a number of dispersed Pt0 nucleation sites, which would eventually combine together to form a film of (110) orientation. Marković and coworkers had pointed out that the (100) surface of Pt has the highest exchange current density.27 Compared with conventional Pt/C, Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalysts showed much higher desorption peak intensity of Pt (110) and less of Pt (111) and Pt (100).
Pt2+ preferred to form a stable metal-like bond with electrons provided by Pt0, since Pt0 is reduced on Pt2+, which has replaced Fe2+ or Ca2+ in FeHAp, forming the more stable chemical bond between Pt and FeHAp. And when Fe2+ and Ca2+ were in a stable ionic state, the Pt nanoparticles on HAp were merely a thin film, and thus, the coherence of Pt with HAp base matrix during ion exchange could cause Pt d111 to be compressed into the bottom atomic layer, hence the observation of bigger Pt particle size under TEM.
It is possible that the (110) plane of Pt can be coherent with the (2 1 10) plane of FeHAp due to some coherent lattice parameters. Pt nanoparticles on HAp could merely be oriented in thin films of a few layers of atoms, which were compressed flatter than other Pt/HAp combinations due to the coherence with a HAp base matrix, hence the larger Pt d111 than usual. In the other words, dECSA was smaller than dTEM and dXRD. Consequently, the Pt precipitated in the nanosized FeHAp is considered to be a thin flake, revealing more ECSA than the round particle.
Among them, the Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB catalyst exhibited the highest ECSA value (m2 g−1), possibly due to the following reasons:
Signs of Pt agglomeration were observed in Pt/FeHAp-CB1/CB; some Pt/FeHAp were not bonded with CB in Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB; and Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB showed the most complete allocation of Fe, Pt, and HAp.
In the integral area ratio of XPS, the Pt0 level in Pt/FeHAp-CB2 was more than the other two catalysts, and thus, it was speculated that the amount of Pt0 would affect ECSA.
Pt/FeHAp-CB has not been further mixed with carbon block and the scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 as shown in Figure 7B. The CV diagrams of the 10th, 100th, 500th, and 1000th cycle of Pt/FeHAp-CB1 catalysts, and the relevant data were presented in Table 3. The retained capacities of Pt/FeHAp-CB catalysts (79.3%-91.1%) as listed in Table 3 were higher than those of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalysts (53.6%-70.1%). This means that bonding of CB and HAp in advance could greatly enhance the durability and stability, suggesting a strong tie between FeHAp-CB and Pt particles, which was the sign of good adhesion and binding strength.
The content of Pt2+ was higher in Pt/FeHAp-CB1 than Pt/FeHAp-CB2 and Pt/FeHAp-CB3 on the integral area ratio of XPS, as listed in Table 2, and Pt/FeHAp-CB1 even showed the greater retained capacity (91.1%) than the other two after 1000 cycles. Such more Pt2+ could contribute to chemical stability. On the other hand, Pt/FeHAp-CB3 had the more content of Pt0, resulting in the more ECSA, as listed in Table 3. This research method could improve the stability of FeHAp catalysts and effectively prevented the migration of Pt, as well as exhibiting a strong anticorrosive capability in H2SO4.
The resulting voltammograms of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB electrodes compared with Pt/C are shown in Figure 8A. In general, the CV curve could have a typical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) peaks, including the forward peak (IF) and the reverse peak (IR), while the mass activity (A gPt−1) was specified as the current per unit mass of catalyst. The mass activity of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalyst is higher, and the IF/IR ratio is greater when compared with the Pt/C, implying the excellent tolerance for CO and other carbonaceous species during MOR. Moreover, poisoning rate parameter (δ) can be calculated to evaluate the catalyst tolerance to poisoning from potentiostatic experiments by Jiang and Kucernak,36 as illustrated in Figure 8D and Table 3.

The series of Pt/FeHAp-CB catalysts, PtRu/C, Pt/C, and the mix of Pt/FeHAp and CB were compared, as shown in Figure 8A. The mass activity and the IF/IR ratio of Pt/FeHAp/CB were much better than Pt/C, even though there was a sign of CO poisoning. A similar result was observed in Pt/FeHAp-CB1, primarily due to a smaller quantity of FeHAp, which would have a smaller CO poisoning effect. It could also be one of the primary causes for severe Pt agglomeration, as illustrated in Table 4 and Figure 8A.

The forward peak of Pt/FeHAp-CB1/CB was found around 830 mV and its reverse peak around 610 mV, owing to the deletion of the partially oxidized carbonaceous species (such as carbon monoxide) produced in the forward scan. Both onset potential and mass activity of Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB and Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB were lower than Pt/C, and they were better than Pt/C in terms of quality and activity. It was because FeHAp-CB was more efficient in removing CO than iron hydroxide, as proposed and discussed in Figure 5.
Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB and Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB also exhibited higher mass activity than PtRu/C at high potential, as shown in Figure 8A. It was speculated that Fe2+/Fe3+ in these two catalysts activated water to yield FeOHads at low potential and the coexistence of Pt2+ and Pt0 might have promoted the electron transition.
Also, Pt, FeHAp and CB were tightly bonded such that Pt and FeHAp were connected along the periphery of CB to uniformly disperse Pt particles, as seen in Figure 4C. Therefore, it implied that the ion exchange between Pt2+ and Fe2+ in FeHAp allowed the Pt particle dispersion with less agglomeration, resulting in the enhanced electrochemical performance. Since Pt/FeHAp-CB1 had less FeHAp and could not promote the dispersion of Pt particles, they would agglomerate and affect the electrochemical performance. Moreover, the comparison of the integral area ratio by XPS showed that in addition to better performance in ECSA for the catalyst with a higher Pt0 content, the CO detoxification in MOR was prominent as well, revealing the lower onset potential and the greater mass activity for Pt/FeHAp-CB3, as listed in Tables 2 and 4.
The dual catalytic capability of Pt/FeHAp-CB may be resulted from the mechanism for promoting CO oxidation to CO2, where H2O was dissociated into H+ and OH−, as with Ru.36 As H+ is in proximity to PO43− and the hydroxide ions are in proximity to Fe2+/Fe3+, they react with the CO poisoning the Pt/FeHAp-CB. Eventually, opportunities for CO2 and H+ were created to eliminate the effects of CO poisoning. However, the onset potentials of Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB were all much higher than that of PtRu/C. The details on IF, IR, mass activity, and onset potential were summarized in Table 4. There was no peak value for the reverse current density found in the methanol oxidation curve for Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB and Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB, even after 100 cycles, indicating no saturated current density due to CO poisoning. In contrast poisoning effects are always found for Pt-V2O5/C, Pt-Nb2O5(2:2)/C, Pt-ZrO2/CNTs, PtPb-MnOx/CNTs catalysts as listed.37-39
For the CO stripping experiments, CO gas was purged in the electrolyte for 10 minutes, and the electrode potential was applied at 100 mV. After high-purity N2 purging for another 10 minutes to eliminate any dissolved CO in the electrolyte, the adsorbed CO was oxidized by CV for two cycles (from −0.2 to 1 V, the sweep rate 50 mV s−1), and the CO stripping curve was recorded. The resulting CO-stripping voltammograms of Pt/C, PtRu/C, and a series Pt/FeHAp-CB/CB catalyst, as illustrated in Figure 8B,C.
It is found that the CO-stripping and onset potential of Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB were both lower than those of Pt/C. In correspondence with Figure 8A, Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB did indeed have higher mass activity. The result indicated that Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB had a greater ability at removing absorbed CO than commercial Pt/C.
Apparently, the lower onset potential of Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB was related to the left shift of CO-stripping peak potential. In other words, these undisputedly confirmed the parameters for Pt/FeHAp-CB to dissociate H2O into H+ and OH− that led to a decrease in CO poisoning.
The experimental chronoamperometry results in 1M H2SO4 and 1M CH3OH at 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 1800 seconds (room temperature), as shown in Figure 8D. Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB shows the higher oxidation current (138 A gpt−1) when compared with Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB (81 A gpt−1) and Pt/FeHAp-CB1/CB (34 A gpt−1). After 1800 seconds, its current keeps more stable than the other two.
4 CONCLUSION
In this study, the surface of acetylene CB has been oxidized to generate OH− bonds to enhance the precipitation and dispersion of HAp to form a HAp-CB carrier (substrate) in order to exchange ferrous ions to produce FeHAp-CB, where nanosized Pt particles could then form a tightly bonded Pt/FeHAp-CB catalyst with dual catalytic functions. Furthermore, it was also found that the higher ratio of Pt2+ to Pt0 could be in the favor of electrochemical stability while the higher ratio of Pt0 to Pt2+ could be in the favor of ECSA in hydrogen adsorption/desorption reactions. With increasing FeHAp level, no reverse current peak was found in Pt/FeHAp-CB2/CB and Pt/FeHAp-CB3/CB catalysts, even after 100 cycles in MOR, since Fe2+/Fe3+ in these two catalysts activated water molecules at a low temperature to yield FeOHads and the coexistence of Pt2+ and Pt0 could enhance the electron transition. The mechanism of enhancing CO oxidation to CO2 was similar to transition metal for dissociating H2O into H+ and OH−, and leading to H+ adsorbed on PO43− and OH− adsorbed on Fe2+/Fe3+, where the latter combined CO adsorbed on nanosized Pt for forming CO2 and H+ to delete the poisoning effect. Besides, the higher content of Pt0 the lower onset potential and the greater mass activity were.
