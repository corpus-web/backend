Abstract:
We theoretically investigated the selective backextraction towards Am(III) over Eu(III) and Cm(III) with two water-soluble 2,9-bis-triazolyl-1,10-phenanthroline derivatives BTrzPhen1 (with two ethanol side chains) and BTrz-Phen2 (with two 1,2-butanediol side chains) by density functional theory (DFT). The molecular geometries and formation reactions of the metal-ligand complexes were modeled by using M(BTrzPhen)(NO3)3 and[M(BTrzPhen)2(NO3)]2+. Am(III) selectivity over Eu(III) and Cm(III) with BTrzPhen2  was successfully reproduced by back-extraction reaction free energy analysis. Moreover,bonding properties between the metal cations and coordinated ligands (model complexes) were studied in terms of Mayer bond order and quantum theory of atoms i molecule (QTAIM). The difference in covalency between An–N and Eu–N bonds were found to be the key factors for Am(III)/Eu(III) separation, while the Am(III) selectivity over Cm(III) of BTrzPhen2  might be attributed to the competition of donor atoms for cation binding preference toward Am(III) and Cm(III).

1 Introduction
Safe disposal and recycling of nuclear waste, especiallythe high level liquid waste (HLLW) plays very important role in nuclear energy industry. After Pu being recycled, the so-called minor actinides (MAs, like Am, Cm and Np) dominated the radiotoxicity of the nuclear waste. These minor actinides need proper treatment, as they pose a significant safety risk to the environments and human health. One reasonably safe method to handle HLLW is the partitioning and transmutation (P&T) [1–3]. To improve the efficiency of the P&T strategy, lanthanides (Lns) must be separated from minor actinides, because of their high proton capture cross-section. However, separation between trivalent minor actinide ions and lanthanide ions is challenging because the oxidation state, chemical reactivity, stability and other chemical properties of these metal ions are very similar to each other [4, 5]. Compared to non-aqueous reprocessing, solvent extraction has been employed as more useful techniques for MA separation by using special extraction and back-extraction ligands.
In the past decades, many special soft-donor extraction ligands (ligands with S and N donor atoms) were developed to extract and separate An(III) from Ln(III) [6–8].
Recently, the mutual separation of Am(III) and Cm(III) through back-extraction to further reduce the volume of transuranic waster after An(III)/Ln(III) process has gained tremendous focus, since Cm is much harder to handle (which needs very thick shield) [9–11]. However, Am and Cm have almost the same atomic radii, charge, and other properties, separating Am(III) and Cm(III) is an extremely tough issue, even harder than An(III)/Ln(III) separation.
Experimentally, Am(III), Cm(III) and Ln(III) can be co-extracted from aqueous solution to N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyldiglycolamide (TODGA)-based organic phase, then hydrophilic ligands such as sodium 3,3′,3″,3‴-([2,2′-bipyridine]-6,6′-diylbis (1,2,4-triazine-3,5,6-triyl))tetrabenzene-sulfo-nate (SO3
-Ph-BTBP) [12] and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis[(6-carboxypyridin-2-yl)methyl] ethylene-diamine (H4 TPAEN) [13] can selectively strip Am(III) from organic phase to aqueous solution. These hydrophilic back-extraction ligands not only improves the separation ability of Am(III) and Eu(III), but also helps to realize the separation of Am(III) and Cm(III). For example, using SO3 -Ph-BTBP and TODGA, the Am(III)/Cm(III) separation factor (SFCm/Am) is about 2.6 ~ 3 at different pH conditions [12], while for H4 TPAEN, SFCm/Am can reach to 3 at pH 1 [13]. In 2017, Edwards et  al. [14] synthesized a 2,9-bis-triazolyl-1,10-phenanthroline derivative with two ethanol side chains (BTrzPhen1). By substitution of on H atom of –CH2 OH on each side chain of BTrzPhen1 witha –CH2 OH group, BTrzPhen2 with two 1,2-butanediol side chains was obtained, see Figure 1. They found that both ligands can separate Am(III) and Eu(III) through backextraction, while BTrzPhen2 can also be used as Am(III)/ Cm(III) separation agent. It is the first phenanthrolinebased ligand found to possess Am(III)/Cm(III) separation ability through back-extraction.
There is already enormous experimental and theoretical information on the structures, metal-ligand bonding nature, and thermodynamic properties of actinide complexes with phenanthroline-derived ligands [15–18].
However, most of these related theoretical works focus on the mechanism of extraction and separation of Am(III)/ Eu(III) [19–21]. Theoretical studies about Am(III)/Cm(III) back-extraction and separation are limited [22–24]. In this work, we systematically investigated the structure, chemical bonding, and thermodynamic stability of Am-, Eu-, and Cm-complexes formed with two phenanthroline based ligands (BTrzPhen1 and BTrzPhen2) and analyzed and compared the tiny differences of bonding nature and thermodynamic properties of the same ligand with Am(III), Cm(III) and Eu(III).

2 Computational details All calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) method with the Gaussian 09 D.01 program [25]. The hybrid functional B3LYP using non-local correlation of LYP [26] expression, and VWN functional III [27] for local correlation, widely used in theoretical studies of actinide complexes [28–30], was selected in this study. The quasi-relativistic effective core potentials (RECPs) were taken into consideration, 60, 60 and 28 core electrons were substituted by the chosen small core RECPs for Am, Cm and Eu, respectively. In addition, the affiliated segmented contraction scheme (ECP60MWB-SEG for Am, ECP60MWB-SEG for Cm, and ECP28MWB-SEG for Eu) [31] basis sets were applied for valence electrons. For other light atoms (C, H, N, O), the standard Pople basis set 6-31G(d) was used in the optimization calculation, while a larger basis set 6-311G(d,p) was selected for the calculation of other properties. The spin-orbit coupling was neglected in this work.
Two ligands BTrzPhen1 and BTrzPhen2  were firstly optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. To compare their electronic structures, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was performed at a higher theoretical level method B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) with NBO3.0 [32]. Subsequently, the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) maps
of two ligands were calculated through the Multiwfn  3.4programs and visualized through VMD software [33].
Based on the previous experimental and theoreticalworks of Am, Cm, and Eu complexes with phenanthroline-derived ligands [34–36], we constructed a series
of BTrzPhen complexes with chemical formulas of[ML2(NO3)]2+ and ML(NO3)3 , where M = Am, Cm, and Eu, L = BTrzPhen1 and BTrzPhen2. At the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/ RECP level of theory, all these metal complexes were optimized without any symmetry restrictions in the gas phase. Subsequently, frequency calculation of the optimized structures was performed at the same level of
theory to make sure the optimized structure we got was actual minima. To study the thermodynamic properties of metal-complexes in solvent, the solvation effect was evaluated through the conductor like screening model (COSMO) [37, 38] in water and n-dodecane. Since the effects of solutions on the structures of rigid phenanthroline-derived type ligands and related metal complexes are negligible [39], only the single point energies were calculated in solvents at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/RECP level of theory, including the thermal energy correction from the gas phase.
For Am, Cm and Eu complexes in TODGA-based organic phase, previous experimental and theoretical works have proved that, the dominant species in non-polar and low-polar diluents were the 1:3 (actinide: TODGA) type complexes [40–42]. TODGA has two long and flexible alkyl chains, M-3TODGA complexes thus are hard to optimize. In 2015, Ali et  al. [43, 44] found that smallsize tetramethyldiglycolamide (TMDGA) with methyl group in the side chain can well reproduce the extraction and selectivity properties of TODGA towards actinide and lanthanide metal cations. To save the computation time and resources, we also selected neutral M(TMDGA)3(NO3 )3complexes to model the actinide complexes in the organic phase.
To study the bonding nature and electronic properties of the Am-, Cm-, and Eu-complexes with two BTrzPhen ligands, Mulliken atomic charges and Mayer bond orders (MBOs) [45] were calculated on the basis of the optimized structures at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/RECP level of theory.
To get more insights into the bonding properties of M-N and M-O, topological analysis of electron density of studied complexes was performed by quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM) methods using the Multiwfn
3.4 program [46].
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic structures and properties of igands
The natural charges loaded on two different binding nitrogen atoms (N atom in triazole rings (denoted as NTrzl) and in phenathanthroline ring (denoted as NPhen) and the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of two ligands are also depicted in Figure 2. From Figure 2, we can see that nitrogen atoms in the triazole and phenanthroline rings of ligands had more negative electrostatic potential values than those on other atoms. The most negative electrostatic potential point located at the center of two ligands and may be the preferred sites of electrophilic attack by the actinide and lanthanide cations.
Comparing with BTrzPhen1, slightly less negative natural charge was loaded on the NTrzl atoms of BTrzPhen2. Since BTrzPhen2 has two more –CH2 OH groups than BTrzPhen1, –CH2 OH group is a weak electron-withdraw group in these type ligands based on natural charge analysis.
Here, we also find that slightly more negative natural charge was loaded on NPhen atom of BTrzPhen2 than that on BTrzPhen1 ligand, indicating that the charge transfer  in the phenanthroline ring of BTrzPhen2 can increase with introducing of –CH2 OH group. The most negative ESP value of BTrzPhen2 (−84.59 kcal/mol) is also more negative than BTrzPhen1 (−81.49 kcal/mol), in agreement with the results of natural charge population analysis.
3.2 The structures of metal-ligand complexes
Experimentally, BTrzPhen ligands can strip actinides and lanthanides cations from organic phase to nitrate-rich aqueous solution. In aqueous solution, trivalent actinideand lanthanide ions may form both 1:1 and 1:2 (metal:ligand) type complexes with tetradentate phenanthrolinetype ligands, and the specific back-extraction complexesmay depend on experimental conditions such as pH,metal/ligand ratio and so on. Many previous works haveshown that deca-coordinated [ML2(NO3)]2+ and ML(NO3)3complexes are the main species in the back-extractionprocess. For example, Whittaker et  al. [34] find thatEu(CyMe4-BTBP)(NO3)3 and Eu(CyMe-BTBP)2(NO3)]2+ are the main complexes existed in aqueous and organic solvents. Lewis et al. [35] also reported that 1:2 type complexEu(CyMe4-BTBP)2(NO3)]2+ is the main extraction complex.
Through DFT calculations, Narbutt et al. [36] also provedthat [M(C2-BTBP)2(NO3)]2+ and M(C2-BTBP)(NO3)3 (M=Am.Eu) are the main complexes (with the most negative Gibbsfree energy) formed between Am(III), Eu(III) and C2-BTBP.
Therefore, In our works, only the neutral 1:1 type complex,ML(NO3)3, and a positive charged 1:2 type complex,[ML2(NO3)]2+were considered as the main back-extraction
complexes in aqueous solution.

The optimized geometrical structures of Am, Eu and Cm-complexes with one and two BTrzPhen1 ligands are depicted in Figure 3, whereas the calculated M–NPhen and M–NTrzl bond lengths are presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the experimentally measured structural
parameters of [Eu(BTrzPhen1)2(H2O)]3+ by Edwards et  al. [14] along with calculated Eu–N, Eu–O lengths are also provided in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the calculated gas-phase Eu–NPhen, Eu–NTrzl, and Eu–O bond lengths of[Eu(BTrzPhen1)2(H2O)]3+ are consistent with the corresponding data in crystal (the largest deviation is less than 0.1 Å). In particular, the Eu–NPhen, Eu–NTrzl bond lengths are well reproduced with deviation less than 0.05 Å, this consistence may some extend suggest that the method we used is suitable for the studied M-BTrzPhen systems.
For 1:1 and 1:2  model complexes ML(NO3)3 and[ML2(NO3)]2+, we can find that metal ions are deca-coordinated packed in the center of two BTrzPhen ligands and nitrate ions. Generally, some Eu–N and Eu–O bonds seem to be slightly shorter than those of Am–N, Am–O bonds. However, these differences are all smaller than 0.026 Å, after subtracting the radii of Am(III) and Cm(III) (r(Am(III) = 0.98 Å, r(Eu(III) = 0.95 Å) ions [37, 48], the‘revised Am–O, Am–N distances’ are slightly shorter than‘Eu–O, Eu–N distances’. Therefore, the two BTrzPhen ligands may have stronger interaction with Am(III) than with Eu(III). For Am- and Cm-complexes, geometrical structures are almost the same with each other. With the same ligand, Am–NPhen bond is slightly shorter than Cm– NPhen bond, while Am–NTrzl bond is slightly longer than Cm–NTrzl bonds. Two type nitrogen atoms may have different actinide cation binding preference. Besides, M–NPhen and M–NTrzl bonds of M-BTrzPhen1 complexes are longer than those of M-BTrzPhen2 complexes, while M-O bonds of M-BTrzPhen2 complexes are shorter than those of M-BTrzPhen1.
3.3 Bonding characteristic analysis
To investigate the metal-ligand binding characters, Mayer atomic bond orders of the M–O, M–NPhen, and M–NTrzl bonds were calculated by Gaussian 09 at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/ SC-MWB level of theory. The Mayer bond orders (MBO) of these studied bonds and Mulliken charges loaded on the central metal atoms (Eu, Am and Cm) are presented in Table 2. Many previous theoretical studies have identified that QTAIM [49] analysis can provide useful information on the bonding nature of actinide complexes [50–52]. Thus, the topological analysis of the electron density of the M–O (N) bonds have also been performed using QTAIM method with Multiwfn 3.4 code. The calculated QTAIM parameters at bond critical points (BCPs) of the M–N and M–O bonds in M-BTrzPhen complexes are shown in Table 3.
The calculated Mayer bond orders of M–N and M–O bonds are in the range of 0.10 ~ 0.34, suggesting that the interactions between the central metal cations and N, Odonor atoms to be electrostatic with only slight covalen character. This is also supported by the results of QTAIM analysis presented in Table 3. All the electron densities (ρ) are smaller than 0.05 a.u., whereas the corresponding Laplacian values (∇2ρ) are all positive. For a same ligand, the Mayer bond orders and of Eu–O and Eu–N bonds are all slightly smaller than those of An–O, An–N (An = Am, Cm) bonds, indicating that slightly more covalent characters exist in An–O, An–N bonds than those in Eu–O, Eu–N bonds. Moreover, compared to those loaded on Eu atoms, less Mulliken charges on Am, Cm atoms has been observed, suggesting more charge transfer betweenBTrzPhen ligands, NO3 − and the Am(III), Cm(III) cations. Based on our calculations (Table 2), values of Mayer bond order of Cm–NTrzl bonds are 0.002 ~ 0.004 larger than Am–NTrzl bonds in counterpart complexes. However, the calculated Mayer bond orders of Am–NPhen and Am–Obonds are slightly larger than their Cm counterparts. For example, in the case of M(BTrzPhen2)(NO3)3 , the MBO of Am–NPhen is 0.008 larger than those of Cm–NPhen, and the MBO of Am–O is 0.001 larger than Cm–O, demonstrating that those two donor atoms prefer Am(III) over Cm(III).
Therefore, binding preference competition of NPhen, O and NTrzl atoms of two actinide cations may play critical roles during metal coordination and separation. By introducing of –CH2 OH group, the MBOs of most M–N, M–O bonds become smaller, in accordance with the bond length data presented in Table 1. In fact, the weak electron-withdrawing –CH2 OH group in the side chain may slightly weaken the interactions between metal ions and NTrzl atoms, then nitrate ions and steric effect may ‘pull’ the central cations slightly away from the NPhen atoms.
Previous theoretical studies [51, 52] have proved that QTAIM analysis can help to investigate the metal-ligand bonding nature of lanthanide and actinide complexes.
The calculated electron density (ρ), laplacian of electrondensity (∇2 ρ), energy density (H), at M–N and M–O BCPs in1:1 and 1:2 M-BTrzPhen2 complexes are presented in Table 3.
These parameters can be used to characterize and classify the bonds in the studied metal-complexes. Generally, at BCPs, when ρ > 0.20 a.u. and ∇2 ρ < 0, the corresponding interaction can be classified as covalent bonds, whereas ρ < 0.10 a.u. and ∇2 ρ > 0 indicates ionic, van der Waals,hydrogen bonding or other closed-shell interactions [53, 54]. Therefore, from Table 3, we can find that M–O, M–N bonds in M-BTrzPhen2 systems can be classified as closedshell interactions. However, it is hard to distinguish some special dative bonds, which possess some weak covalent characters, without considering the electron energy density (H) at BCPs. According to the literature [53], the magnitude of H can somewhat reflect the “covalency” of the interaction. H > 0 and ∇2 ρ > 0 means pure closed-shell interactions, H < 0 and ∇2 ρ > 0 at BCPs can be classified as dative interactions (partial covalent interactions). As presented in Table 3, all the Eu–N, Eu–O bonds have positive H and ∇2 ρ values, thus should be classified as pure closed-shell interactions. Negative H values can only be found in the An–NPhen and An–O bonds of the studied complexes. Though very small in magnitude (less than 0.4 × 10−3 a.u.), these negative H values can be used as indicators of partial covalent characters in An–NPhen and An–O bonds. Therefore, the An(III)/Eu(III) separation with two BTrzPhen ligands should be attributed to the different degrees of covalence between An–NPhen, An–O bonds and their Eu counterparts.
For An-BTrzPhen2 (An = Am and Cm) complexes,the relative values of QTAIM perameters (ρ, ∇2 ρ, H)deduce the bond strength orders of Cm–NPhen < Am–NPhen, Cm–O < Am–O and Cm–NTrzl > Am–NTrzl, which can agree with the above Mayer bond order analysis well. Since two different soft donor N atoms in different positions exhibit different binding preferences toward Am(III) and Cm(III), the hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory [55], which was used to interpret Am(III)/Eu(III) separation, is probably not suitable for explaining Am(III)/Cm(III) separation behaviors with BTrzPhen ligands. Based on the above analyses, NPhen and O donor atoms in our studied molecules show cation preference of Am(III), while the NTrzl atoms seem to prefer Cm(III). The competition of different donor atoms for cation preference of Am(III) and Cm(III) might be the main reason for the separation of Am(III) and Cm(III) with BTrzPhen2 ligand. In detail, in M-BTrzPhen1 complexes, the “competition” may stay in balance, thus no Am(III)/ Cm(III) separation ability can be found in BTrzPhen1.
According to the data of MBO, ρ, and H, with the introducing of –CH2 OH groups, the natural charge (as presented in Figure 1) and binding affinity of NTrzl atoms may decreased.
Subsequently, the completion of binding affinity of NTrzl and NPhen towards different central actinide ions leads to the Am(III)/Cm(III) separation ability of BTrzPhen2 ligand.

3.4 Free energy analysis
The process of back-extraction metal ions from organic phase to aqueous solution is very complicated, which involves partition of metal-complexes, transfer of ion pair to the interface of two phase solution, forming of new metal complexes in aqueous solution and so on [56, 57]. Here, the influences of the transfer processing (from n-dodecane to aqueous solution) on Am(III)/Eu(III)and Am(III)/Cm(III) separation are estimated with thefree energy differences (Δ(ΔGtran)) between the free energies of Am and Eu(Cm) complexes, i.e. Δ(ΔGtran)Am/Eu andΔ(ΔGtran)Am/Cm, and these energies are calculated using thefollowing two equations [23, 28].tran Am/Eu aq aqorg orgAm L – Eu L– A( ) [ ( ) ( ) ][ ( m L) ( – Eu L) ]G G GG G∆ ∆ = − −− −tran Am/Cm aq aqorg orgAm L – Cm L– A( ) [ ( ) ( ) ][ ( m L) ( – Cm L) ] In the above formulas, Gorg/aq =Ggas +ΔGorg/aq + RTln(RT/p), [58] Ggas is the Gibbs free energy of complex in gas phase, ΔGorg/aq is the solvation free energy (equals to the total electronic energy difference of a same complex in gas-phase and in n-dodecane or aqueous phase, which was calculated at B3LYP/ECP//6-31G(d) level of theory), and RTln(RT/p) term is 1.89 kcal/mol at T = 298.15  K and p = 1.0 atm. To gain the Ggas at a high accuracy, a larger basis set 6-311G(d,p) was used. The calculated Δ(ΔGtran) Am/Cm, Δ(ΔGtran) Am/Eu data of our studied complexes are presented in Table 4. According to Table 4, transfer Am-, Cm-complexes from n-dodecane to aqueous solution were more energetically favorable than those of Eu-complexes, with ΔΔGtran,Am/Eu values around −0.4 kcal/mol. Here, we can find that the values of Δ(ΔGtran) Am/Cm of 1:1 and 1:2 An-BTrzPhen complexes are all positive (0.13 and 0.19 kcal/mol), suggesting that transferring Cm-BTrzPhen2 complexes from organic solution to aqueous solution is energetically favorable than those of Am-BTrzPhen2 complexes. Thus, the transfer differences between the Am- and Cm-complexes had little contribution to the Am(III)/Cm(III) separation, and the Am (III) preference of BTrzPhen2 ligand should be ascribed to some other back-extraction processes, such as partition of metal complexes in organic phase and re-coordination of metal cations and BTrzPhen ligands in aqueous solution.
The overall free energy changes (ΔGback-ext) of the backextraction reactions with the products of M(BTrzPhen)
@
The calculated ΔGback-ext and its differences between Am- and Eu-complexes (ΔΔGback-ext (Am/Eu)), and those between Am- and Cm-complexes (ΔΔGback-ext (Am/Cm)) are also presented in Table 4. According to these free energies, we can find that the ΔGback-ext values of back-extraction reactions with 1:1 neutral products (M(BTrzPhen1)
(NO3)3 and M(BTrzPhen2)(NO3)3) are more negative(3 ~ 6 kcal/mol) than those with 1:2 positive products([M(BTrzPhen1)2(NO3)]2+ and [M(BTrzPhen2)2(NO3)]2+).
Thus, with increasing the concentration of BTrzPhen ligands, the extraction efficiency of these two ligands may decrease. However, the ΔΔGback-ext(Am/Eu) values increases with the products changing from 1:1 to 1:2 products.
Therefore, to gain better Am(III)/Eu(III) extraction performance, less BTrzPhen ligands should be used, while to obtain better Am(III)/Eu(III) separation performance,more BTrzPhen ligands might be better. However, opposite results can be found for Am(III)/Cm(III) separationaccording to the trends of the absolute values of ΔΔGback-ext.
With the products changing from M(BTrzPhen2)(NO3)3 to[M(BTrzPhen2)2 (NO3)]2+ (namely, 1:1 to 1:2), the absolute ΔΔGback-ext values decreased although the differences of these values are very small. For example, with the products change from An(BTrzPhen2)(NO3)3 to [An(BTrzPhen2)2(NO3)]2+ , ΔΔGback-ext,2 value changes from −1.64 to −1.57 kcal/mol. Theoretically, the separation factor between Am(III) and Cm(III) can be estimated using the formula ∆∆Gback-ext,Am/Cm = −RTln(SFCm/Am) [20, 59]. For the reactions with neutral and charged products, the calculated SFCm/Am for BTrzPhen1 is 10.28 and 6.74, while the calculated SFCm/Am for BTrzPhen2 is 15.95 and 14.17, respectively. Thus, BtrzPhen2  has higher ability for Am(III)/Cm(III) separation than BTrzPhen1, and this trend is in line with the experimental Am(III)/Cm(III) separation trend of these two BTrzPhen ligands [14].
4 Conclusion
Complexation mechanisms of the Am(III), Cm(III) and Eu(III) species with two BTrzPhen ligands were systematically studied using density functional theory. The larger Mayer bond orders, less Mulliken atomic charges on central metal cations, and QTAIM parameters (larger ρ, more negative H) reflect stronger interaction between two ligands and Am(III) compared to Eu(III) and Cm(III), which might indicate a selectivity of Am(III) over Eu(III) and Cm(III). Besides, QTAIM analyses also certified that An–N, An–O bonds possess partial covalent characters, while Eu–N, Eu–O bonds does not. Thus, this weak covalent characters exist in An-O, An-N bonds may be the key factors for the An(III)/Eu(III) separation. The separation mechanism of Am(III)/Cm(III) is more complicated, our calculation results show that two different N donor atoms may exhibit different binding preference toward Am(III) and Cm(III). The Am(III)/Cm(III) separation of BTrzPhen2 ligand may be attributed to the competition of O, NPhen and NTrzl atoms.
According to the calculated Gibbs free energy, the “transfer process” of metal complexes from organic phase to aqueous solution has little contributions to the separation of An(III)/Eu(III) and Am(III)/Cm(III). The separation performance of two BTrzPhen ligands may be more correlated with the partition and recoordination of metal complexes in two phase solutions. Moreover, the initial ratio of different reactants and concentration of nitrate ions can greatly influences the back-extraction and separation results. With the product change from 1:1 neutral metal-BTrzPhen complex to 1:2 positive metal-BTrzPhen complex, the overall back-extraction reaction free energy decrease, while the Am(III)/Eu(III) separation ability of ligands increase. In contrast, for Am(III)/Cm(III) separation, extra BTrzPhen2 ligands may decrease the separation.
We hope that the present work will help in understanding the Am(III)/Eu(III), Am(III)/Cm(III) back-extraction and separation properties of BTrzPhen ligands, and designing other phenanthroline derivatives for Am(III)/Cm(III) separation. Researches on the influences of introducing other substituent groups in the side chains of BTrzPhen ligands are still in progress.
