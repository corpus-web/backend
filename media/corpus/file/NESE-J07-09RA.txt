<Section>Abstract</Section>
Study of single bubble behavior under rolling motions can prove useful for fundamental understanding of flow field inside the modern small modular nuclear reactors. The objective of the present study is to simulate the influence of rolling conditions on single rising bubble in a liquid using multiphase Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method. Rolling force term was added to 2D Navier-Stokes equations and a computer program was written using C language employing OpenACC to port the code to GPU. Computational results obtained were found to be in good agreement with the results available in literature. The impact of rolling parameters on trajectory and velocity of the rising bubble has been studied. It has been found that bubble rise velocity increases with rolling amplitude due to modification of flow field around the bubble. It has also been concluded that the oscillations of free surface, caused by rolling, influence the bubble trajectory. Furthermore, it has been discovered that smaller vessel width reduces the impact of rolling motions on the rising bubble. The effect of liquid viscosity on bubble rising under rolling was also investigated and it was found that effects of rolling became more pronounced with the increase of liquid viscosity.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Offshore Small Modular Reactors (OSMRs) are emerging as a popular mobile source of electric power due to their benefits such as small size, inherent safety against hazards like earthquakes and due to the fact that these nuclear reactors do not occupy land [1]. Owing to lower power rating of these reactors, it is possible to utilize the natural circulation to remove the heat generated in the rectors. The bubbles produced in the flow may alter the thermal hydraulics characteristics of the reactor due to the interaction of the wake behind the bubbles with the flow [2]. In natural circulation flow, generation of bubbles in various parts of the reactor gives rise to instabilities which affect the flow and heat transfer in the reactor [3]. The interaction of winds and waves present in the sea with the barge containing the OSMRs gives rise to rolling motions that affect the movement of coolant and bubbles inside the rector. The resulting rolling force engenders momentous changes in the flow field and heat transfer inside the reactor [4]. Additionally, the rolling force can also alter the bubble behavior including bubble trajectory, aspect ratio and rise velocity significantly. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the effects of rolling force on the rising gas bubble for safe operation of these nuclear reactors. Besides, the study of single bubble behavior may also prove helpful in fundamental comprehension of bubble distribution in multidimensional problems [5].
As gas bubble behavior is a complex phenomenon, owing to its transient nature and deformable shape of bubble, many researchers have investigated it experimentally. Single bubble behavior has been studied in various types of viscous fluids and the results have been categorized on the basis of various dimensionless numbers including Morton number, Eӧtvӧs number and Reynolds number [6,7]. Non-linear oscillations and rolling motions arising from ocean conditions produce additional acceleration terms and modify the gravity force acting on the bubble, which affect the bubble behavior and void fraction significantly. Jin et al. experimentally investigated the void fraction and pressure drop in narrow rectangular channels with bubbly flow under ocean motions and found the pressure drop to be relatively independent of ocean conditions while mean void fraction reduced with rolling in these channels [ [8,9]]. Tian et al. studied interfacial area concentration, void fraction and bubble frequency experimentally under rolling conditions and found a periodic variation in these parameters with rolling [10]. Researchers have studied the impact of rolling motions on bubble rising in an array of rod bundles under stagnant conditions [11], slide velocity and bubble lifetime in rectangular narrow channels under rolling motions [12] and bubble departure diameter under heaving motions [13] experimentally.
Some researchers have used numerical simulations for analyzing the single bubble behavior under ocean motions and non-linear oscillations. However, the number of computational studies of bubble behavior under rolling is quite limited due to the complexities involved in the numerical solution of the problem. Some of these studies have employed numerical methods like Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method available in CFD softwares whereas others have used particle-based methods for simulation of multiphase problems. Wei et al. investigated the bubble behavior in subcooled flow boiling in a rectangular channel using VOF method for various pressure and heat flux values under swing motion [14]. They found that swing motion caused variations in mass flow rate, which had a significant influence on the forces acting on the bubbles. In another work, the impact of non-linear oscillations on bubble rise velocity, bubble trajectory and shapes was studied using VOF and ALE methods utilizing OpenFOAM [15]. Chen et al. considered the influence of rolling motion on the rising gas bubble trajectory, velocity and lateral movement using ALE and VOF methods using Fluent [16]. They presented the effect of various rolling amplitudes, rolling periods and bubble sizes on the single bubble behavior. An excellent review of numerical and experimental investigations related to effects of ocean motions can be consulted for further details [1].
Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method [17] employs Lagrangian description of fluid and represents the liquid, gas and solid walls as different kinds of particles. Being a meshless method, it is well suited to bubble dynamics, because it can trace the complex moving gas-liquid interfaces with ease. Furthermore, this method computes the time dependent solution of fluid flow problems; therefore, it is appropriate for simulation of rolling motion, which is inherently a transient phenomenon. The MPS method has many variants including simple MPS method, MPS-MAFL (the Meshless Advection using Flow-directional Local-grid) method [18] and multiphase-MPS (MMPS) method [19]. Both MPS-MAFL and MMPS can be utilized for simulation of multiphase flows and bubble behavior, however, MMPS can predict the bubble trajectory and shape with much better accuracy. MPS-MAFL method has been employed for simulation of multiphase flows in various studies for bubble behavior in liquid metals [20], void bubble dynamics [21], Taylor bubble rising in LBE (Lead-Bismuth-Eutectic) [22], steam bubble condensation [23], and for computation of bubble trajectory and rise velocity under rolling motions [24]. MPS method has been employed to investigate laminar flow and friction characteristics under rolling motions [25]. The effectiveness of MMPS method for investigation of bubble behavior has been demonstrated in some studies [26,27] but none of these deals with ocean motions. Li et al. have published a comprehensive review on achievements, current challenges and future prospects of MPS method [28]. Another excellent review summarizes the applications of MPS method for bubble dynamics simulations [29].
MMPS methods involves many computationally intensive tasks comprising of surface tension calculation, pressure solver and neighbor-particle search, therefore, it necessitates the utilization of an efficient high-performance computing framework. GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) provide an excellent option for accelerating the particle method based codes. Previously, researchers have employed GPUs for simulations involving particle methods [30,31]. OpenACC (Open Accelerators) is a directive based programming model that can be employed to port an existing code to GPUs [32]. As OpenACC is a relatively new standard, hardly any researcher has utilized it for porting a particle method code to GPUs. In the current research work, OpenACC has been implemented in the MMPS code to run it on GPU.
Scarcity of computational studies on important phenomenon of gas bubble rising under rolling motion necessitates its further investigation. To the best of knowledge of the authors no extensive experimental study is available in literature that deals with this phenomenon. A few computational studies related to this topic employ MPS-MAFL or VOF method that make use of significant assumptions in the description of the bubble. In the present study an existing MMPS based computer program, in C language, has been modified to examine the influence of rolling motions on bubble behavior. The study is directed to analyze the efficacy of MMPS method for such problems. Results of MMPS method have been validated with experimental results available in the literature. A comparison of results of this method has also been presented with the results of MPS-MAFL method that were presented in a previous study. The present work also aims to study the influence of rolling parameters, liquid properties and vessel dimensions on bubble trajectory, bubble rise and lateral drift velocities. Furthermore, present study also compares the results and simulation time of the GPU based code with CPU code for MMPS method to explore the benefit of utilization of OpenACC for particle-based methods.
<Section>2. Details of governing equations and MMPS method</Section>
Some fundamental details of governing differential equations, MMPS method and mathematical treatment of rolling motions are being presented in the sub-sections below.
2.1. Governing differential equations and improved MMPS-CA method
Continuity and momentum equations for viscous, isothermal flow of incompressible fluid are given below:
@(1)
@(2)
The terms on right side of Eq. (2) represent effects of pressure gradient, viscous, surface tension, gravity and rolling forces respectively while the term on the left side denotes the rate of change of momentum for the moving particles.
The current study employs the improved MMPS-CA (continuous acceleration) method for simulation of bubble rising under rolling conditions. In improved MMPS-CA method, various terms in the differential equations are replaced by the relevant particle approximations for multiple phases [26]. These approximations are given below:
Viscosity term:
@(3)
Where Gaussian kernel function, G, is given as:
@(4)
Pressure gradient term:
@(5)
where Cij is the dimensionless improved matrix and H represents the classical hyperbolic kernel function given as:
@(6)
Kernel function, H(r) limits the number of neighbor particles utilized to calculate the physical properties of the fluid. For a give particle i, the total particle-count inside the particle influence radius, re, is known as particle number density, which can be calculated as:
@(7)
The time step size for this method can be estimated using following expression [26]:
@(8)
Additional information about MMPS-CA method can be obtained from the literature [19,26]. Surface tension model put forth by Duan et al. [33] has been employed in the present study. After replacing the above particle approximations in Eq. (2), we get an algebraic expression, which is written for every particle in the domain to obtain a system of algebraic equations. Some terms of Eq. (2) including gravity, surface tension, rollig force and viscosity are treated explicitly whereas pressure is calculated implicitly from a system of equations obtained from pressure Poisson equation using Conjugate Gradient (CG) method [34]. Once the velocity of the particles is calculated, it can be used to update the position of the particles in the domain. Fig. 1 illustrates the steps involved in the solution process using MMPS method in the form of a flowchart.
Fig. 1. Flowchart summarizing the various steps of solution procedure.
2.2. Mathematical formulation of rolling force
Almost all the researchers have approximated the rolling motions with superposition of sine waves of various amplitudes and periods [35]. The rolling force and gravity variations, caused by rolling motion, are a function of both space and time. Fig. 2 shows vector representation of various components of rolling force including centrifugal force (Fn), tangential force (Ft), Coriolis force (Fc) and horizontal and vertical components of gravitational force acting on the fluid in an accelerating frame of reference. All these rolling force and gravity components can be related to angular displacement, velocity and acceleration. For a periodic rolling motion, angular displacement can be approximated as:
Fig. 2. Components of rolling and gravity forces in a non-inertial reference frame.
@(9)
Rolling angle is taken positive counterclockwise. From Eq. (9), angular velocity and acceleration can be derived as given below:
@(10)
@(11)
Components of gravitational force acting on fluid can be resolved as under:
@(12)
@(13)
The cumulative rolling force on the fluid can be given as:
@(14)
The expressions for the various acceleration components are given below:
@(15)
@(16)
@(17)
The apostrophe in Eq. (12–17) signifies that the relevant quantities refer to non-inertial reference frame (x’, y’) undergoing rolling motion. The magnitudes of all the force components depend upon β, ω, gx and gy. Fig. 3 presents a comparison of relative magnitudes of all the accelerations acting on the fluid and bubble. Here, β and ω2 can be considered as linear accelerations with unit moment arms (x’ or y’). It can be observed that in vertical direction gy is the most significant force, which affects the bubble rise velocity, while in horizontal direction gx is the dominant force, which causes the bubble to drift horizontally i.e. to migrate in the transverse direction. Although the magnitudes of β and ω2 seem to be insignificant yet their effect may become important for larger values of moment arms (x’ or y’).

2.3. Domain geometry and solution parameters
The computational domain for the problem at hand comprises of a 2D rectangular area with a gas bubble close to the bottom. Fig. 4 presents a representative domain for the problem. The width of the domain is taken as 0.05 m and height of liquid level in the domain is kept as 0.15 m. Solid walls bound the domain on bottom, left and right sides while the upper side is open to atmosphere. Two different types of particles have been utilized to represent liquid and gas phases. Left and right boundary particles are of free-slip-wall-type, which simulate slip boundary on the side walls to minimize the effect of presence of wall on the flow field around the bubble, while the bottom boundary has been represented with no-slip-wall-type particles to simulate no-slip boundary condition there. Moreover, three additional rows of dummy-wall-type particles are introduced along all the walls that help to keep the particle number density unaffected near the wall regions. Ratio of re to average particle spacing is kept as 3.1. The rolling pivot is taken at the bottom wall where vertical central axis bisects the domain and rolling amplitude is considered positive in counterclockwise direction. The bubble is released when the vessel and liquid inside it is already in a quasi-steady state. In this study, the liquid is considered as water with air bubble else specified otherwise. In Fig. 5, the analysis of influence of particle size on rise velocity of 5-mm bubble has been presented. It can be seen that rise velocity becomes almost independent of particle size at 0.25 mm. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows the effect of dr0 on bubble shape, which also becomes almost independent of particle size for dr0 = 0.25 mm. Decreasing the particle size to 0.2 mm from 0.25 mm for a domain size of 0.05 m × 0.15 m results in 56% increase in number particles in the domain and in almost doubling the computational time. Hence, reasonable results for bubble behavior can be obtained using MMPS method, while conserving computational power and memory, by taking particle size as 10% of initial bubble radius. Chen et al. have reported a similar criterion for MPS-MAFL method [36]. The total number of particles in 0.05 m × 0.15 m domain for dr0 of 0.25 m are about 126,000. The time step size for 5-mm bubble rising in water is 3.25 × 10−6 s.

2.4. Speed up of simulations on GPU
In the current study, simulations have been performed using NVIDIA RTX-2080 GPU and MMPS code containing OpenACC directives was compiled using PGI 19.10 Community Edition compiler for Linux. The code ported using OpenACC, with some improvements in pressure solver, showed reasonable speed-ups over the CPU version of the code. In a test case, the GPU code demonstrated a speed up of around 53% for a bubble rising problem involving 85,246 particles over CPU based MPI + OpenMP implementation of MMPS code that utilized 6 MPI processes with 18 OpenMP threads each i.e. a total of 108 processors. The details of the test case have been presented in Table 1. The comparison of the bubble trajectories calculated using GPU and CPU has been shown in Fig. 7. Code speed up has been calculated using Eq. (18):

<Section>3. Validation of simulation results</Section>
The validation of the present results has been performed with the experimental study available in the literature [24]. In Fig. 8, comparison of bubble trajectory of 4-mm bubble with experimental data is presented for θmax = 5° and T = 2 s. It can be viewed that the results of bubble trajectory predicted by MMPS code agree well with experimental data. The bubble rise velocity has also been compared with the experimental values for θmax = 5° and T = 2 s in Fig. 9. It is evident that bubble rise velocity matches reasonably well with the experiment results. The discrepancy in the results of rise velocity arises due to the two-dimensional cylindrical representation of a three-dimensional spherical bubble. Table 2 presents the comparison of experimental and simulated bubble shapes with respective bubble aspect ratios. As the platform containing the vessel undergoes rolling motion, the free surface of water in the vessel also periodically changes due to the variations in the gravity and rolling forces, which was captured using a video camera [24]. Comparison of variations in liquid free surface and its slope during a rolling period calculated by MMPS method with experiment is shown in Fig. 10. The figure shows that numerical scheme has adequately captured the variations of interface caused by rolling phenomenon. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of bubble trajectory of 4-mm bubble simulated with MMPS method with experimental result for θmax = 10° and T = 8 s. The results of MMPS are again in a good agreement with experiment. This shows that numerical method can predict the bubble behavior under rolling for variety of situations with reasonable accuracy.

In a previous study, MPS-MAFL method was used to investigate the bubble behavior under rolling motions [24]. MPS-MAFL is based on combination of both Lagrangian (MPS) and Eulerian (MAFL) schemes. This method comprises of three phases: Lagrangian phase (just like an ordinary MPS method), Re-configuration phase and Convection phase (in which a one-dimensional local grid is used). Further details of the method can be found in the literature [18]. MPS-MAFL can tackle phenomena with deforming boundaries i.e. bubbles and free surfaces; and inflow/outflow boundary conditions easily in less computational time. However, this method represents bubble with a void and calculates pressure inside the gas bubble using equation of state. Furthermore, extension of this method for 3D problems is difficult. On the other hand, MMPS method, used in the present study, represents bubble with a different particle type from liquid and solves pressure Poisson equation for particles inside the bubble as well, therefore, it can capture the bubble behavior with better accuracy. This method can be extended to 3D problems easily, however, due to smaller time step size and larger number of particles in the domain for the same physical problem MMPS method is computationally more intensive. In Fig. 8, it can be observed that MMPS method has captured the zig-zag motion of bubble in its trajectory in a better way than MPS-MAFL method.
<Section>4. Results and discussion</Section>
4.1. Effect on bubble trajectory
Under stationary conditions, there is no apparent body force acting on the bubble in lateral direction; however, rolling phenomenon gives rise to various acceleration and gravity components in horizontal direction resulting in the lateral migration or drift of the bubble. This lateral drift of the bubble is dependent upon both maximum rolling angle and period. The impact of variation in maximum rolling amplitude on 5 mm air bubble trajectory in water is shown in Fig. 12. It can be observed that bubble migrates farther away horizontally as the rolling amplitude increases because rolling force and gx increase with maximum rolling amplitude. Owing to the transient nature of the problem, these lateral movements of bubble are function of time as well as space. Fig. 13 shows the variation of lateral drift of bubble for various rolling angles as a function of time. As the rolling force varies in a sinusoidal fashion with time, a sinusoidal variation of bubble lateral drift with time is observed. Bubble trajectory is also affected by the variation in the period of rolling motions, as shown in Fig. 14, because rolling accelerations and gx decease with the rolling period. For rolling period of 1 s, the bubble starts to move to the right at first but reverses its lateral drift direction when gx becomes negative. Furthermore, it can also be observed in Fig. 14 that the height at which bubble starts to drift horizontally, increases with rolling period i.e. approximately 0.025 m for T = 1 s to 0.05 m for T = 3.5 s. Hence, the further increase in rolling period causes the bubble lateral drift to start at progressively greater height. Moreover, its horizontal drift at higher rolling periods will become quite gradual. Therefore, it can be concluded that effects of rolling reduce with rolling period. The oscillations observed in the bubble trajectories in Figs. 12 and 14 are the characteristic of instability of bubble shape in a low viscosity fluid i.e. water in the present case [37].

Fig. 14. Effect of rolling period on 5-mm bubble trajectory.
4.2. Effect on bubble velocity
Rolling may also alter the bubble rise and lateral drift velocities considerably. Fig. 15 illustrates the influence of variation of maximum rolling angle on bubble climb velocity for 5-mm air bubble in water. It can be viewed that at lower θmax, bubble rise velocity is higher and it decreases with θmax because at smaller rolling angles, magnitudes of rolling accelerations and gx are smaller while that of gy is larger, resulting in a greater bubble rise velocity. However as θmax increases, magnitude of gy decreases and gx rises, causing the bubble rise velocity to decline. The effect of rolling can also be observed on bubble drift velocity in horizontal direction as shown in Fig. 16. At the start of rolling cycle, bubble drift velocity is negligible as the bubble tends to rise straight up for every rolling angle. However, as gx rises rapidly for the case of higher rolling angle, therefore, the lateral drift velocity increases with θmax. As the bubble ascends further, its shape and trajectory become unstable causing the bubble to move on a zigzag trajectory. Consequently, its drift velocity rapidly varies between positive and negative values with little effect of variation of rolling angle.

Fig. 16. Bubble lateral drift velocity for 5-mm bubble in water for various rolling angles.
Table 3 shows the bubble shapes and velocity vectors around and inside a 5-mm air bubble in glycerin-water solution under stationary and rolling conditions at different time instances. It can be observed that for stationary conditions, as bubble rises up the vortices behind the bubble extend vertically downwards and are symmetric in shape. However, as the rolling angle is increased the bubble becomes progressively tilted due to rolling force. Moreover, velocity vectors and vortices behind the bubble also become lopsided due to the effects of gx and acceleration variations caused by rolling as mentioned in Fig. 3. Therefore, it can be concluded that rolling force modifies the velocity field inside and around the bubble significantly which affects its velocity, trajectory and may influence its shape and aspect ratio.
Table 3. Comparison of 5-mm bubble shapes and velocity vectors in glycerin-water solution.
4.3. Effect of vessel size on bubble rising under rolling
The water level in vessel and width of the vessel can influence the bubble rising under rolling motion. Findings of the numerical simulations are detailed in the subsequent sub-sections.
4.3.1. Effect of water level in vessel
The liquid near the bottom of the vessel under rolling effectively stays stationary; however, rolling may give rise to waves and disturbances near the liquid free surface. The free surface also moves nearly at the period of the rolling motion; therefore, it may have some effect on the bubble trajectory and rise velocity when it approaches the free surface. Fig. 17 shows the bubble trajectories for various water levels employing a dimensionless vertical coordinate for a better comparison. It can be seen that although the rolling period of free surface is same in all the water levels, yet the bubble trajectory near the free surface is different for all the cases. This happens due to the influence of the oscillations of free surface on the rising bubble. It can also be observed that for smaller water levels, when bubble starts to rise, a larger fraction of the trajectory remains unaffected by rolling motions. As the water level is increased, fraction of the bubble trajectory affected by rolling motions is also increased.
Fig. 17. Comparison of 5-mm bubble trajectories for various water levels for θmax = 5°; T = 2 s.
4.3.2. Effect of vessel width
Under stationary conditions, as rising bubble does not have a preferred lateral movement except for some random oscillations, therefore, it has been proposed that vessel width of 4 times the bubble diameter is sufficient for accurate simulations [38]. However, due to lateral drift induced by rolling motion, the bubble can move sideways significantly. Therefore, the vessel width can have a substantial influence on bubble. In Fig. 18, it can be observed that for a smaller vessel width of 0.03 m, the effects of rolling are almost non-existent because the walls of the vessel hinder the movement of the water in the vessel. However, as the width of the vessel is increased, the effect of rolling on bubble trajectory becomes more pronounced. Therefore, it can be concluded that the width of the vessel has a significant impact on trajectory of bubble ascending under rolling.
Fig. 18. Comparison of 5-mm bubble trajectories for various vessel widths for θmax = 5°; T = 2 s.
4.4. Effect of liquid properties
Liquid properties have a substantial influence on the bubble shape, stability, trajectory and velocity under stationary conditions. Similarly, fluid properties also have a significant impact on bubble trajectory and rise velocity of bubble rising in a fluid under rolling motions. In Fig. 19, trajectories of 5-mm air bubble rising in water (ρw = 998 kg/m3; μw = 0.001 kg/m-s and σw = 0.072 N/m) and glycerol solution (ρl = 1150 kg/m3; μl = 0.018 kg/m-s and σl = 0.063 N/m) under rolling motion have been compared. Due to higher viscosity of glycerol, there is a higher resistance to movement of the bubble which, initially, results in a smaller bubble rise velocity than in water, which is evident from Fig. 20. This reduction in bubble rise velocity amplifies the impact of rolling force on the bubble movement. Consequently, bubble horizontal drift i.e. the transverse migration of the bubble is increased and it travels a longer distance in horizontal direction in glycerol solution than in water. However, as bubble rises further, the bubble shape stays more stable in high viscosity fluid due to lower local Reynolds number and less velocity variations in the wake region of the bubble. This results in much less oscillations in the trajectory of bubble in glycerol solution than in water, which can be seen in Fig. 19. Because of the reduced oscillations, bubble rise velocity in glycerol becomes more than that in water and much less fluctuations in the rise velocity of bubble are observed in Fig. 20. Therefore, it can be inferred that the impact of rolling motions on bubble trajectory and rise velocity become more pronounced for the fluids with higher dynamic viscosity.

<Section>5. Conclusions</Section>
Present research is aimed at studying the impacts of rolling motions on bubble ascending in liquid using multiphase MPS method. To carry out the simulations, a computer code has been written in C language employing OpenACC directives to run the code on GPU. The results of the computer program have been corroborated with the experimental data available in literature. Effects of rolling period and amplitude on bubble trajectory and velocity have been investigated. Furthermore, influence of water level, width of vessel and liquid properties on bubble rising under rolling motion have also been studied.
It has been concluded that influence of rolling motion grows with rolling angle and deceases with period of rolling motion. The rolling motions modify the horizontal as well as the vertical forces acting on the bubble thus influencing the bubble trajectory and velocity. It has been observed that, for rolling in counterclockwise direction, bubble rise velocity decreases and lateral drift velocity increases with rolling amplitude. Moreover, it has been found that velocity field around and inside the bubble is modified by the rolling force.
The impact of free surface and width of the vessel on bubble under rolling conditions has also been studied. It has been seen that height of liquid free surface affects the trajectory of the bubble near the surface due to the oscillations of the free surface caused by rolling. Furthermore, it was found that for a vessel with smaller width the influence of rolling motions on rising bubble is negligible and it becomes pronounced as the width of vessel is increased.
The liquid properties, especially viscosity, has a substantial impact on bubble trajectory and velocity. It was concluded that high viscosity liquid amplifies the effect of rolling motions on the velocity and trajectory of the rising bubble.
