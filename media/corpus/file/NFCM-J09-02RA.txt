Summary
This paper presents a design study of power shape flattening for an optimized ultra-long cycle fast reactor with a power rate of 1000 MWe in order to mitigate the power peaking issue and improve the safety with a lower maximum neutron flux and reactivity swing. There are variations in the core designs by loading thorium fuel or zoning fuels in the blanket region and the bottom driver region of ultra-long cycle fast reactor with a power rate of 1000 MWe. While it has lower breeding performance in a fast breeder reactor, thorium fuel is one of the promising fuel options for future reactors because of its abundance and its safety characteristics. It has been confirmed that the thorium fuels, when loaded into the center region of a reactor core, lower the power peaking factor from 1.64 to 1.25 after 20 years and achieves a more flattened radial power distribution. This consequently reduces the maximum neutron flux and the speed of the active core moving from 3.0 cm/year to 2.5 cm/year on the average over the 60-year reactor operation. It has been successfully demonstrated that the three-zone core is the most optimized core, has the most flattened radial power shape, and is without any compromise in the nature of long cycle core, from the neutronics point of view, in terms of average discharge burnup and breeding ratio.

1 Introduction
Nuclear energy is a promising medium-term solution to energy challenges and makes a contribution to the diversity of energy supplies of the future with a low-carbon source of electricity 1, 2. The fast reactor is being actively investigated as a future nuclear reactor, and it is widely researched in a large variety of core concepts 3-6 and assessed from many innovative material and safety points of view 7-9. The sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is one of the representative fast reactor concepts considered as a future reactor system in Generation IV reactors 10. The potential of the inherent safety characteristics of SFR had been proven by many studies with metal alloys 11 and by the evaluation of unprotected loss-of-flow accidents 12. Among those SFR concepts, the concept of long-life SFR has been developed with the purposes of improved uranium utilization, interim storage of light water reactor spent fuel, providing a solution to nuclear proliferation issues, and reducing capital and operational costs with its very high discharge burnup. Various strategies have been proposed for the development of a long cycle reactor. Constant axial shape of neutron flux, nuclide densities and power shape during life of energy production (CANDLE), proposed by Sekimoto, is the long-life reactor concept that adopts a breed-and-burn strategy in the axial direction so the core life can be extended by increasing the axial length. In addition, CANDLE operates such a long cycle for itself without any reactivity control by an operator 13. Terra Power Corporation, a nuclear reactor design company founded by Bill Gates, has developed traveling wave reactor (TWR), which is also a breeding reactor with a long-life core but the breeding direction is radial and travels from the core center to the periphery. The company has developed a 600 MW (electric) prototype reactor intended to start up early 2020s, followed by global commercial deployment 14. 4S is another representative SFR reactor concept in Japan with a power rate of 10 and 50 MWe. It applied advanced safety concepts and technologies from the two small size fast reactors, MONJU and JOYO. 4S has a movable reflector surrounding the core for compensating the burn-up reactivity loss over a 30-year lifetime 15. There is a small size fast reactor concept in Korea, which is a compact sodium-cooled breed-and-burn reactor with a CANDLE configuration with a power rating of 250 MWth. This concept has been proposed to find the acceptable compact sodium-cooled TWR traveling in the axial direction. It has a very high fuel volume fraction of over 60% and the design has been developed from the neutronics point of view 16.
The Ultra-long cycle fast reactor (UCFR) was developed for a 60-year operation and has a power rating of 2600 MW (thermal) 17. Ultra-long cycle fast reactor utilizes a breed-and-burn strategy by using low enrichment uranium (LEU) as an igniter and natural uranium as a blanket material. The feasibility of the core operation was reported from the neutronics point of view. For this core, it was noticed that the high reactor power rating, combined with high peaking, could cause a very large amount of local power and consequently violate the limits of temperature or fast neutron fluence in the fuel and clad regions 18. There are preceding studies for the power flattening with fuel loading strategy, and the utilization of thorium fuel is one of the useful options for the strategy 19-21. Thorium fuel is a proven technology, and it is a good alternative fuel not only for fast reactor but also the other reactor types such as CANDU 22-25.
A UCFR-1000 design was introduced in order to decrease the peaking factor at the core center using thorium as a blanket material in the inner core region, which contributes to radial power flattening. The result shows the radial peaking factor at the center decreases at middle of cycle (MOC), and it was confirmed that the power flattening was achieved 26. An optimization of UCFR was performed from a thermal hydraulic feedback analysis, and subsequently, a thorium loaded optimized UCFR-1000 was presented that has an inner fuel region whose radius is a half of the whole fuel region, in contrast to that previous UCFR-1000 with an inner fuel region of only 1/4 the radius of the whole fuel region 27. Furthermore, LEU zoning was also performed to confirm the feasibility of flattening the radial power distribution for beginning of cycle (BOC) and end of cycle (EOC) 28.
In this study, a power flattening study of the optimized UCFR was performed to mitigate the power peaking issue with several core design variations, by loading thorium fuel or zoning fuel regions, not only in the blanket, but also in the driver fuel region. Moreover, the performance of each core design was evaluated with assessing the operational feasibility and safety characteristics from their reactivity parameters.
2 Core Design of Ultra-long Cycle Fast Reactor-1000 with Power Flattening
In this chapter, core design parameters, geometry and compositions are presented with the review of thorium as nuclear fuel from the neutron economy point of view, particularly for fast breeder reactors (FBRs).
2.1 Thorium fuel performance in fast reactor
Thorium, with its abundance and competitive characteristics as a nuclear fuel, is a promising fuel option for future reactors of, not only thermal spectrum, but also fast spectrum. In this section, thorium fuel performance is evaluated as a FBR fuel in the neutronics point of view. The η value for an isotope is the number of neutrons emitted in the fission process per neutron absorbed. In a FBR, the breeding capability of a core can be assessed by this value. This value can be expressed as
urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er3552:er3552-math-0001
(1)
where urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er3552:er3552-math-0002 is the number of neutrons per fission, and urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er3552:er3552-math-0003 and urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er3552:er3552-math-0004 are the cross sections of capture and fission, respectively 29. urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er3552:er3552-math-0005 and the capture to fission are the inherent characteristics of each isotope that judge the competitiveness of the isotope as FBR fuel. 233U, converted from 232Th by neutron capture, has the two parameters lower than those of 239Pu in the fast spectrum, as shown in Table I, which consequently leads a lower eta value of 232Th than that of 238U. This has an effect on the multiplication factor at the thorium loaded fuel region in a core so that it decreases the flux and consequently decreases the relative power in this region.

Another important factor for the breeding performance of fast reactors is the fast fission of fertile isotopes such as 238U and 232Th. In thermal reactors, about 2% of the power is contributed by the fast fission of fertile fuel, whereas in fast reactors, as much as 25% may be contributed by fast fission 29. This is called the fertile fast fission bonus. Figure 1 shows the fission cross sections of major fissile and fertile isotopes to demonstrate the fertile fission bonus. Because the fertile fission occurs only above certain threshold energy, and the fission cross section increases as incident neutron energy is higher, a harder neutron spectrum is required to have a higher breeding ratio. This is the main reason for the preference of high density metal fuel and the tight triangular lattice for FBRs. The threshold of 232Th is higher than that of 238U, while 232Th has a lower fission cross section than 238U above the threshold. This is another main factor that makes the thorium loaded region weak in breeding performance.
Figure 1
Neutron fission cross section (red: 232Th, green: 233U, blue: 235U, purple: 238U, soil: 239Pu) 30.
Figure 2 presents the neutron yield per neutron absorbed according to its incident neutron energy for major isotopes. In fast spectrum, the value of η for all the fuel isotopes increases as its energy spectrum hardens. It is noted that the η of 233U is larger than that of 235U and 239Pu in thermal and intermediate energy regions, but the η of 239Pu increases drastically in the fast spectrum region and becomes larger than that of 233U. This fact is an important factor when a sodium void occurs in the fast reactor core. The sodium voiding is followed by spectrum hardening and leakage increase that have large impacts on the sodium void worth in the opposite direction to each other. The competition of the two factors results in either positive or negative sodium void worths. In this respect, the use of thorium fuel is more beneficial from the safety point of view.
Figure 2
Neutron yield per neutron absorbed for major isotopes.
To estimate the effect of thorium fuel loading on the multiplication factor, the thorium fuel performance was tested in a simplified UCFR-1000 geometry of homogeneous cylinder. In Figure 3, the blue graph is for a reference case, which uses the same materials as UCFR-1000. The core of the green graph uses a binary metallic form of Th-10Zr, which is the same form as the reference core. This has lower fuel density and less thorium compared with the other two cases. For the core of the red graph, 235U and 238U were replaced by 232Th keeping the fuel mass, that is, the same amount of thorium has been loaded to compare the fuel material performance. As shown in this figure, both thorium blanket cores have sharp k-effective decreases compared with the natural uranium blanket core. And even though the same amounts of fuel are loaded, the thorium loading causes a larger than 10,000 pcm decrease for the blanket material of UCFR core.

2.2 Core design strategy for power flattening
UCFR-1000 is the reference core for this study with a single fuel form of U-10Zr. The core design variations have been introduced to flatten the radial power shape. Basic common parameters for core design are summarized in Table II, and these parameters remain unchanged for all the variation cases in this paper.
In this paper, thorium is used in the core center region to make the radial power shape of the core flattened with its relatively weak breeding performance. In addition, fuel zoning was performed by the fuel form variation of a driver or a blanket for each case, as presented in Table III. The blanket is separated into two regions for all variation cases; an inner core region and an outer core region. Each of the variation cases is named after the number of zones in the driver region.

Equivalent core diameter (m)	5.7

Figure 4 shows the top view of the one-zone core layout in the x–y plane. The one-zone core has the same geometry as the reference core but also has a separated blanket where there are 108 thorium loaded blanket assemblies in the inner core, in seven radial rings out of the total 750 fuel assemblies in 17 radial rings.
Figure 4
One-zone core layout of UCFR-1000 in x–y plane.
Figures 5-10 show the layout of variation cores in x–z plane. As shown in Figure 5, the reference core has a uniform fuel distribution in the radial direction, while there are two separated fuel regions in the axial direction; LEU driver and blanket. The bottom LEU performs the role of igniter at BOC, and it burns and breeds upward to the blanket region, which performs the role of breeder. Ultra-long Cycle Fast Reactor adopts a fission gas-vented fuel concept, in which the fission gases are directly released into the primary coolant during the reactor operation 31. There is a reflector region at the core bottom and radial reflector assemblies surrounding the fuel region. In Figure 6, the one-zone core adopts thorium fuel in its center but the bottom driver region is the same as the reference core. As shown in Figure 7, the two-zone core has an inner core region for its driver as well as blanket, and the inner core adopts thorium fuel while the outer driver has a reduced zirconium fraction. This zoning strategy for the driver region is to distribute the center power peak at BOC as well as MOC and EOC.

The driver region of the three-zone core consists of an inner core, middle core, and outer core with different fuel form for each. Three variation cases were considered, as shown in Figures 8-10, for the three-zone core that has one additional part in the driver region than the two-zone core to make the radial power shape more flattened. Each case has a different fraction of the driver and blanket zones, and the performance and operational feasibility of each case are compared.
3 Performance Evalutaion
3.1 Computation method
The computations for the core design and performance evaluation were performed using the McCARD code, which solves a continuous energy neutron transport equation based on the Monte Carlo method. For the depletion analysis of nuclear power reactors, McCARD has built-in subroutines to solve the depletion equation. The McCARD code was validated using various benchmarks in the ICSBEP 32, which include critical experiments from thermal spectrum to fast spectrum, fueled with U and/or Pu fissile materials. The depletion capability of the code was validated with comparison against well-known burnup codes such as CASMO 33, HELIOS 34, and MVP-BURN 35 36.
3.2 Depletion performance
Figures 11 and 12 shows the multiplication factor behaviors of the reference and thorium loaded cores. All the calculations for this paper were performed with the following conditions: (i) all control rods were out, (ii) the depletion calculation step size is 1 year, (iii) the number of neutron histories is determined so that the average standard deviation of all the steps is no more than 10 pcm, (iv) the average fuel assembly temperature is assumed to be 900 K and 800 K for the other assemblies, and (v) The compositions of each assembly are homogenized based on the volume fractions. It is noted that time calculations have considered the evolution of all actinides as well as fission fragments, which includes the neutron poisoning over time.

Figure 12
k-effective vs. operation time for the reference core and thorium fuel loaded cores – operational.
For Figure 11, the cores ‘three-zone – a’ and ‘three-zone – c’ are not operational because of the reactivity lack from loading thorium fuel its fuel center region that it is too much thorium loaded to achieve criticality. In Figure 12, on the other hand, the reference core has a lifetime of more than 60 years, and the k-effective values are less than 1.03. The three-zone – b core is the only thorium-loaded core that achieves a lifetime of longer than 60 years, and this core has the smallest reactivity swing among the cores. The initial mass ratio of 235U to 232Th for this core is 0.69. Figure 13 presents the mass flow of major fuel isotopes in this core. 235U is consumed as a major fissile fuel at the BOC, and the amount of 235U and 232Th decreases as the core burns while that of 239Pu increases. This core will be analyzed as the three-zone core in this paper.
Figure 13
Time evolution of major fuel isotopes.
Figure 14 shows the neutron flux variation of the reference core and two-zone core at their centers. The reference core and one-zone core have the maximum neutron flux at their bottoms (at BOC) because of LEU burning while the two- and three- zone cores have the maximum neutron fluxes in their middle of the fuel rods (at MOC). There is no notable difference, however, in fast neutron fluence, because the peak fast fluence appears at the middle of the fuel for both reference and thorium loaded cases. The graph of this area has therefore not been changed much, which can be confirmed by integrating the neutron flux graph. It is noticed that the peak at the bottom of the two-zone core occurs around 20 years later than that of the reference core, and the peak at the top of the two-zone cores occurs 10 years later than that of the reference core, which means the active core movement at the center is slower for the fuel zoning core.
Figure 14
Neutron flux variation of the reference and thorium loaded cores at their center.
Figures 15-17 show the profile of the normalized axial power distribution in the center fuel assembly at BOC, MOC, and EOC that indicate the active core movement at the center. In Figure 15 for BOC, the active core of each case stays within 70 cm of the core bottom where the peaking factor is greatest. The active core moves to the top of the core as the core burns and breeds, as shown in Figure 16 for MOC. The active core movement of the reference core is the fastest, and the speed is slower for one-zone core because of the thorium blanket loading. Two-zone and three-zone cores are even slower than that of one-zone core because they have a bottom driver zoning region, which makes the speed of the active core at the center slow.

Table IV summarizes the depletion calculation results of the reference and thorium loaded cores. The active core movement at the core center is slower in the fuel zoning region than that of in the uniform fuel region. Through this, it has been confirmed that fuel zoning can achieve the radial power flattening in the UCFR-1000 core, not only in BOC but also in MOC and EOC in the two-zone and three-zone cores.

Reference	One zone	Two zone	Three zone

Blanket (inner/outer)	U-10Zr	U-30Th-10Zr / U-10Zr
235U enrichment of driver	11.9%
Table V shows the breeding ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of produced fissile to the amount of consumed fissile. The calculation was performed with the assumption that all the 238U is converted to 239Pu and all the 232Th is converted to 233U. The values have the same tendency, and there is no notable difference. It has been confirmed that the flattening of radial power distribution has no significant effect on the breeding performance, even if the speed of the active core decreases.

3.3 Power flattening performance
The power peak moves from the center to the peripheral region in the reference core. At MOC, the active core is the shape of Bessel function, and the curvature gets larger as core burnup proceeds. Because the center region is depleted, the peaking of the active core is moved to the peripheral region at EOC.
The power flattening effect of the thorium loaded cores is indicated through Figures 18-21, which show the normalized radial power distribution every 20 years. The axially integrated powers of the fuel assemblies in 1/12 core are normalized according to the number of assemblies in each ring. The figures show that thorium-loaded cores achieve the power flattening in their center region in comparison with the reference core. The peak of the reference core appears in the center fuel region at BOC and moves to the peripheral region as burnup continues. The peak of the one-zone core is also moving from the center to the peripheral region but the peak factor has decreased. The one–zone core has a peak factor of 1.25, particularly at year 20, because of the effect of thorium fuel in the inner core region while the reference core has a factor of 1.64, but both have another peak in their peripheral region at EOC. On the other hand, the peak of the two-zone core and three-zone core appears in the peripheral region at BOC because of the LEU fuel form zoning, and the power shape change is not notable after 20 years. These two cases show more flattened radial power distribution than Case 1 throughout the operation time, except for the initial state. At the end of the cycle, at year 60, it is noticeable that the two-zone and three-zone cores have a more flattened shape while the reference core and the one-zone core have a peripheral peak.

Normalized radial power distribution, 60 years.
There is a difference in geometry between two-zone core and three-zone core, which causes a difference in the radial power distribution especially at year 0 and year 60. The peripheral peak of three-zone core is lower than that of two-zone core, and the distribution of three-zone core is more flattened at year 0 and year 60. For year 60, three-zone core has a maximum peak of 1.23 while the reference case has a peripheral peak of 1.35.
Figure 22 shows the average distribution of the normalized radial power profile every 20 years. The standard deviation of each case is 0.32, 0.28, 0.27, and 0.24 for the reference, one-zone core, two-zone core, and three-zone core, respectively, which indicates that the three-zone core has the most flattened shape of radial power profile throughout the operation time.

3.4 Reactivity feedback
Reactivity coefficients of the reference core and thorium loaded cores are summarized in Table VI. The temperature coefficients have a negative trend in every case, but sodium density and sodium void worth show different trends. The radial expansion coefficients at BOC of every case are relatively large because of a large leakage, with a large neutron flux in the enriched uranium region. It is noted that UCFR-1000 has a relatively flat geometry; a wide diameter of 4.8 m relative to the core height of 2.4 m. This can cause larger neutron leakage in the axial direction than in the radial direction.
Table V. Breeding ratio of UCFR-1000.
BOC	MOC	EOC
Reference	0.96	1.14	1.05
One zone	0.96	1.13	1.04
Two zone	0.97	1.12	1.05
Three zone	0.93	1.12	1.07
The large leakage at BOC also keeps the multiplication factor from increasing for the sodium voided state. The sodium void worth increases with the increase in the reproduction factor and the decrease in the delayed neutron fraction, as the fuel is converted from uranium to plutonium. At BOC, the three-zone core has less void worth than the reference core and one-zone core that have no zoning region in their bottom; and the two-zone core has less void worth than the three-zone core because of the two-zone core having more thorium in its bottom driver region than the three-zone core. At MOC and EOC, however, the values are not much different between the cores. A small sodium void worth is expected at EOC where the axial leakage becomes large again because the active core arrives at the top of the fuel. The void worth at EOC, however, is even larger than that of MOC in every case. Sodium void worth is decided by the competition between a positive effect from a spectrum hardening and a negative effect from a neutron leakage. The former is dominant in a core center, and the latter is dominant in a core periphery. This UCFR-1000 is a large core, and the active core is center-peaked shape so leakage has little effect on the k-effective except at BOC where the axial leakage is large. On the other hand, the spectrum hardening is more enhanced at EOC than at MOC in each core because the TRU, which has more sensitivity with a spectrum hardening, has been accumulated as the core burns. This is the reason for the sodium void worth at EOC being larger than that of MOC in all cases. Overall, the three-zone core shows a more negative tendency than any other case. This core is the most optimized core to have long cycle operation with a power-flattened shape.

4 Conclusions
The flattening study of the radial power distribution of UCFR-1000 has been performed with newly developed core designs, and comparisons were made with the original UCFR-1000 design. The flattening of the radial power shape was achieved in the cores, which adopt the thorium blanket or LEU fuel zoning. The one-zone core has a single bottom driver region, that is the same as the reference UCFR, but it has an inner core region of thorium fuel in the top blanket. The two-zone core has the inner core region in its bottom driver region as well as the top blanket, and the three-zone core has an additional zone in the bottom driver region.
It has been confirmed that thorium loading and fuel form zoning can achieve radial power flattening, and consequently reduces the maximum neutron flux and the speed of active core movement. The one-zone core has the power peak in its center at BOC, similar to the reference core; but because of the thorium fuel in the inner blanket region, the peaking factor decreases to 1.25 after 20 years while that of the reference core increases to 1.64. The active core movement at the center becomes slower. The one-zone core has another peak in its peripheral region at EOC, as does the reference core. In contrast to the reference core and one-zone core, the power peaks of the two-zone core and three-zone core appear in the peripheral region at BOC, and the radial power shape of the two cores remain flattened after 20 years until EOC. This power shape behavior delays the active core movement in the axial direction with a speed of 2.5 cm/year, while that of the reference core is 3.0 cm/year on average over 60 years.
Also, it has been confirmed that the average radial power distribution over the core lifetime of the three-zone core is more flattened than those of the other cores. The three-zone core has the smallest reactivity swing, and no noticeable loss in the neutronics performance parameters, such as average discharge burnup, breeding ratio, or temperature coefficients. This means that the three-zone core is the optimum core from safety and reactor operations points of view.
For the future work, the investigation of other fuels for the higher initial excess reactivity, higher enrichment, longer cycle length, and safer characteristics is expected.
