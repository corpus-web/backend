<Section>Abstract</Section>
This paper aims to modify the Lucuta et al. thermal conductivity model of irradiated UO2 fuel to include the high burnup structure effect. The porosity factor of Lucuta et al. model is modified to account for the porosity evolution with increasing burnup. The radiation damage factor of Lucuta et al. model is modified to take account of the removal of defects from the fuel matrix of the rim region. The dissolved fission products factor of Lucuta et al. model is modified to account for the depletion of fission gas atoms from the fuel matrix in the rim region. The effect of grain boundaries thermal resistance on the thermal conductivity is also accounted for as a new multiplier to the Lucuta et al. correlation. The reasonable agreement is seen from the comparison of predicted thermal conductivity with the measured data at high burnup. The conducted parametric study shows the impact of the key parameters on the calculated thermal conductivity.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The thermal conductivity is one of the most important properties of fuel that has a great influence on the fuel operating temperature, performance and behavior. There is a decrease of fuel thermal conductivity under in-pile conditions, caused by the generated defects in the fuel matrix such as fission products impurities, radiation damage defects, porosity formation by virtue of fission gas bubbles.
The UO2 fuel in the low temperature and high burnups develops a so-called high burnup structure (HBS) near the fuel pellet rim region that is characterized by the depletion of fission gas in the fuel matrix and the development of micron-size porosity surrounded by sub-micron-sized grains through a grain subdivision process (Spino et al., 1996; Rondinella and Wiss, 2010). In light water reactors (LWR), HBS initiates at a local burnup of around 60 MWd/kgU and develops fully at around 120 MWd/kgU (Walker, 1999). As the burnup proceeds, HBS extends from the fuel pellet rim towards the pellet center. It has been observed that this new structure formation actually provides a net positive effect, causing a slight increase in the thermal conductivity of irradiated fuel which may seem counterintuitive. In fact, the removal of fission gas atoms from the fuel matrix and reduction of radiation defects from the newly formed submicron grains, mostly free of defects, compensate the porosity formation due to the HBS as reported by Ronchi et al. (2004) and Walker et al. (2006).
The analytical expression for the irradiated fuel thermal conductivity can be presented by a combination of separate effects as the thermal conductivity model by Lucuta et al. (1996) or Tonks et al. (2016) for UO2 fuel. The Lucuta et al. model includes five factors describing separate effects such as dissolved and precipitated fission products, deviation from the stoichiometry, irradiation damage and porosity. It must be noted that, however, the HBS effect has not been taken into account in the Lucuta et al. model.
Several studies have been carried out for the evaluation of HBS effect on the UO2 fuel thermal conductivity. Lee et al. (2001a) determined the effect of calculated rim porosity on the thermal conductivity evaluated by the HALDEN model and found that the rim porosity yields a thermal conductivity degradation of about 20% at high burnups. Lee et al. (2001b) developed a thermal conductivity model of the UO2 pellet rim region, based upon the thermal diffusivity data of the irradiated UO2 pellet measured during thermal cycling. The model predicts the thermal conductivity by multiplying separate factors such as solid fission products, radiation damage and porosity. They found that in the UO2 pellet rim region where rim porosity was calculated to be 15% for burnup of 80 MWD/kgU at 600C, thermal conductivity increased by 18% due to the depletion of fission gases from the matrix. While it decreased by 23% due to the rim porosity, indicating that decrease of thermal conductivity by fission gas bubble formation in the UO2 rim region would be significantly offset by the enhancing effect of fission gas depletion in the UO2 matrix. Bai et al. (2016) performed mesoscale heat conduction simulations with inputs from molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on the unusual behavior of thermal conductivity of UO2 pellet rim region (see also (Tonks et al., 2016)). They also developed an analytical model to predict the thermal conductivity of different microstructures at any given concentration of dispersed Xe, bubble porosity, and grain size based on multiplying the degradation percentage caused by each type of microstructural feature including the high-density grain boundaries in a high burnup structure.
Recently, the present authors studied the effect of porosity formation in the rim region on the Lucuta et al. model and Halden thermal conductivity model (Roostaii et al., 2016) and (Roostaii et al., 2018) but the HBS positive effects on thermal conductivity have not been taken into account in their work.
The aim of this paper is to modify the Lucuta et al. thermal conductivity model to account for the rim structure at high burnup UO2 fuel. This is achieved stepwise, the porosity factor is first modified and a model for determining porosity evolution with burnup as presented in detail in (Roostaii et al., 2016) is employed. Then, modifications are incorporated into the radiation damage and dissolved fission products factors of Lucuta et al. model to take into account the HBS effect. Furthermore, the thermal resistance effect of grain boundaries on the degradation of thermal conductivity is accounted for via a new multiplier to the Lucula et al. model.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, details of models and methods are presented. A brief review of the original Lucuta et al. model is given in section 2. l. Our model previously presented elsewhere (Roostaii et al., 2016) for the porosity evolution, which is based on the model of Rest for calculating the matrix swelling with progressive recrystallization is given in section 2.2. Our method for modification of the Lucuta et al. model, which is based on the volumetric mixing, is presented in section 2.3. In section 3, we give our results, including a parametric study, to clarify the influence of the key parameters on the fuel thermal conductivity. Finally, conclusions of this work are presented in section 4.
<Section>2. Models and methods</Section>
2.1. Lucuta et al. model of thermal conductivity
The thermal conductivity model of irradiated UO2 fuel propounded by Lucuta et al. (1996), multiplying separate effects is written as
(1)k=k0κBκSκRDκP,
where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the unirradiated fully dense UO2 material (100% of theoretical density) given by (Harding and Martin, 1989)
(2)k0=10.0375+2.165×10−4T+4.715×109T2exp(−16361T).
κB is composed of two parts describing the effect of fission products as
(3)κB=κDPκPP,
with κDP accounts for the effect of all solute fission products within the fuel matrix as (Lucuta et al., 1996)
(4)κDP=(1.09Bu(%)3.265+.0643Bu(%)T(K))arctan(11.09Bu(%)3.265+.0643Bu(%)T(K))
where Bu(%) is the fuel burnup in atom(percent), and κPP describes the effect of precipitated fission products (mainly metallic ones) given by
(5)κPP=1+0.019Bu(%)(3−0.019Bu(%)11+exp(−T(K)−1200100),
κS is related to the effect of deviation from the stoichiometry which decreases the thermal conductivity. The oxygen potential measurements in irradiated fuel indicate that the fuel is stoichiometric even at high burnups (more than 62 MWd/kgU) under reactor normal operating (Lucuta et al., 1996). According to Refs. (Spino and Peerani, 2008; Matzke, 1994, 1995), no stoichiometry deviation has been observed at low temperature (<850 K) at burnups about 100 MWd/kgU. Therefore, in the present work, a unit value for κS is considered.
κRD takes into account the effect of radiation damage due to neutrons, α-decay, and fission which increases the number of lattice defects and consequently reduces the fuel thermal conductivity, given by
(6)κRD=1−0.21+exp((T(K)−900)80),
and κP accounts for the effect of porosity on thermal conductivity based on the Maxwell-Eucken formula is expressed as
(7)κP=1−P1+(σ−1)P
where σ is the shape factor equal to 1.5 for spherical pores.
2.2. Porosity evolution model
Porosity is defined as the ratio of voided volume over the total volume. The total porosity P, according to Eq. (8) is composed of two contributions: One comes from pores PV including as-fabricated voids as initial porosity with no contribution to the matrix swelling and the other swelling porosity PSresults from the irradiation-induced fission gas bubbles contributing to the matrix swelling
(8)P=Ps+PV
Following (Roostaii et al., 2016), the swelling porosity Ps is given by
(9)Ps=(ΔVgasbubble/V0matrix)/(1+ΔVgasbubble/V0matrix)
where ΔVgasbubble/V0matrix represents the fractional matrix swelling due to fission gas bubbles, with V0matrix denotes the initial matrix volume, and ΔVgasbubble being the increase of matrix volume due to gas bubble formation. The as-fabricated porosity Pv can be expressed as (Spino et al., 2005)
(10)Pv=1−(1+ΔVmatrix/V0matrix)(ρ/ρth),
where ΔVmatrix/V0matrix is total fractional fuel matrix swelling owing to both solid (ΔVsolid/V0matrix)and gaseous (ΔVgaseous/V0matrix) fission products, with ΔVgaseous/V0matrix represents total fractional gas swelling due to both gas atoms in dynamic solution and fission gas bubbles. ρ is the bulk fuel density and ρth the theoretical density of UO2, with the relative immersion density ρ/ρth can be expressed in terms of the local burnup in the range about 15–100 MWd/kgU as follows (Spino et al., 2005).
(11)ρ/ρth=(0.9383−1.71×10−4Bu3/2)1/2,
where Bu is UO2 fuel burnup in MWd/kgU. As it can be seen, the value of ρ for the UO2 fresh fuel having only as-fabricated porosity is about 0.97ρth.
To determine the porosities Ps and Pv from Eqs. (9), (10), respectively, one needs to calculate the relevant matrix swelling terms. Full details of this calculation were reported in (Roostaii et al., 2016), and here only a brief review is provided.
2.2.1. Matrix swelling at high burnup, low temperature
Irradiation induced recrystallization is a process occurring at low temperatures and high burnups in nuclear fuels such as UO2. In this process, the original micron-size grains are transformed into submicron-sized grains. The critical fission density of Fdx to result in the initiation of recrystallization along the original grain boundaries (GBs) is estimated for UO2 fuel as (Kagana and Rest, 2007; Rest, 2005)
(12)Fdx=4×1024f˙2/15
where f˙(fission/m3sec) is the fission density rate. The subsequent recrystallization front eventually consumes the entire original grain from its surface toward the center. The volume fraction of recrystallized material as a function of irradiation time t is formulated as (Rest, 2005)
(13)Vr=1−[1−96γB2(f·t−Fdx)dgCACρf(ν)2π]3,
where γ is the solid surface energy (=1 J/m2 for UO2), f(ν)=(1−ν/2)/(1−ν), with υ is Poisson's ratio, dg is the diameter of the original grain, CA is 3 for cubic cells, Cρis within a factor of unity (Rest, 2005), and B2 is a constant of proportionality. After the onset of the recrystallization, the original grain is divided into two regions of the recrystallized and unrecrystallized zone. The fractional gaseous swelling of the unrecrystallized zone is given by
(14)(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)g=cga34+4π3rb3cb+4πRb3∁bdg,
where cg, cb, Cb are concentrations of gas atoms in dynamic solution, intragranular and intergranular bubbles, rb, Rb, dg are intra and intergranular bubbles radii and grain diameter before recrystallization, respectively. The first term on the right hand side (RHS) of Eq. (14) represents the swelling due to gas atoms in dynamic solution and does not contribute to the swelling porosity Ps. The second and third terms indicate the contribution of intra and intergranular bubbles to the matrix swelling, respectively, leading to swelling porosity formation, and represent the term ΔVgasbubble/V0matrix in Eq. (9).
The fractional gaseous swelling of the recrystallized zone owing to Xe depletion in the fuel matrix all comes from the intergranular bubbles and can be expressed as (Rest, 2005)
(15)(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)gx=4πRbx3(∁bdg+∁bxdgx+13dgx3),
where ∁bx, dgx, and Rgx are intergranular bubble concentration, grain diameter and intergranular bubbles radius in the recrystallized region, respectively. In Eq. (15) it has been assumed that upon recrystallization the concentration of preexisting bubbles on the boundaries, Cb, remains relatively unchanged (Rest, 2005). The second term on the RHS represents swelling due to intergranular gas bubble in recrystallized grain, and the third term represents the contribution of the triple point bubbles to the gaseous swelling.
The total fractional gas swelling composed of the unrecrystalized zone and recrystallized one given by Eqs. (14), (15), respectively, is written as (Rest, 2005)
(16)(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)TOT=(1−Vr)(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)g+Vr(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)gx,
where Vr is given by Eq. (13). The term ΔVgasbubble/V0matrix can also be calculated as
(17)ΔVgasbubbleV0matrix=(1−Vr)[4π3(rb3cb+3Rb3∁bdg)]g+Vr(ΔVgaseousV0matrix)gx.
2.3. Modified radiation damage factor
There is a decrease of irradiated fuel thermal conductivity, caused by radiation damage such as point defects, dislocation lines, and loops or defect clusters. In the Lucuta et al. model the factor κRD given by Eq. (6) accounts for this effect. After the onset of HBS formation, the process of grain recrystallization occurs in the rim region with low-temperature characteristic, where original grains, including many defects, transform to submicron free defect grains. Therefore with the progress of HBS and overall decreasing defects, the effect of radiation damage on the thermal conductivity must be reduced, resulting in an increase in thermal conductivity as shown by measurements made by Walker et al. (2006) and Ronchi et al. (2004). This positive contribution to the thermal conductivity can be introduced as a modification to the radiation damage factor such that modified one κRDmod is proposed as
(18)κRDmod=(1−Vr)κRD+Vr
It is seen that before the recrystallization process, where Vr=0, Eq. (18) reduces to κRD, and upon completion of recrystallization, where Vr = 1, the modified radiation damage factor becomes κRDmod = 1, as expected.
2.4. Modified dissolved fission products factor
The fission products factor κB given by Eq. (3) is composed of two parts: dissolved and precipitated fission products factors. The precipitated one κPP, given by Eq. (5) contains metallic fission products mainly with thermal conductivity much higher than that of the UO2 matrix, having a positive impact on thermal conductivity. The dissolved one κDP, given by Eq. (4) accounts for the contribution of all dissolved fission products within fuel matrix, including fission gas atoms and Pu build-up to the degradation of irradiated fuel thermal conductivity as addressed by Lucuta et al. (1996).
The generated fission gas is actually composed of a range of different elements, but the dominant one is Xenon (Xe) due to having the largest concentration. Hence hereafter in this work, Xe is considered as fission gas.
Once the HBS in the rim region is formed the Xe depletion from the matrix occurs. This causes a positive contribution to the thermal conductivity (Ronchi et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2006) which in the present work is introduced as a modification to the dissolved fission products factor. The modified one κDPmod is proposed to be written as
(19)κDPmod=(1−VrFXe)κDP+VrFXe
where FXe denotes the ratio of mass fraction of individual Xe atoms in dynamic solution to the mass fraction of all the considered dissolved products. It can be seen that at the onset of recrystallization process, where Vr=0, the RHS of Eq. (19) reduces to κDP, and upon completion of recrystallization, where Vr = 1, the modified dissolved fission products factor becomes κDPmod=(1−κDP)FXe+κDP, which is clearly a factor smaller than unity, and larger than the original one κDP. It indicates that the negative contribution of Xe atoms in dynamic solution to the thermal conductivity is eliminated while that of the other dissolved fission products to the thermal conductivity is preserved.
Neglecting elements with low solubility (Cs, Ba, Te, Sr, Zr and Nb) in UO2 compared to rare earth oxides with large solubility (Kleykamp, 1985), together with Xe atoms and Pu, in this work FXe is estimated from a mass fraction analysis performed by the MCNP code for dissolved fission products in UO2 fuel.
2.5. Grain boundary factor
It is well known that the formation of small grains in the HBS increases the density of grain boundaries by more than one order compared to the fuel microstructure before HBS forms. These GBs have a thermal resistance causing phonon scattering and consequently, a decrease in the fuel thermal conductivity (Bai et al., 2016). To take into account this effect in the Lucuta et al. thermal conductivity model, we introduce a GB degradation factor relating to the grain size and a parameter R named the GB Kapitza resistance. Before the HBS started to form this factor is given by
(20)κGBg=dgdg+Rk0
and after completion of HBS
(21)κGBgx=dgxdgx+Rk0,
where followed by (Bai et al., 2016), we considered the same GB Kapitza resistance for the two different grain sizes in this work. In fact, the GB Kapitza resistance is closely related to the properties of intergranular bubbles. In this respect, a parametric study has been performed in three-dimensional domains that quantifies the effective change in grain boundary Kapitza resistance due to the presence of intergranular bubbles (Millett et al., 2013). The authors in (Tonks et al., 2016) developed an analytical model of the effective GB thermal resistance and compared to the 3D results from (Millett et al., 2013) to parameterize their model.
During recrystallization formation, the GB factor consists of two parts
(22)κGB=κGBg(1−Vr)+κGBgxVr
It is seen that before the recrystallization process, whereVr=0, Eq. (22) reduces to κGBg, and at a completely recrystallized area, where Vr=1, the GB factor becomes κGBgx, which is much lower than κGBg.
2.6. Modified Lucuta thermal conductivity model
Having incorporated the necessary modifications into the Lucuta et al. thermal conductivity model to cover the HBS effect, it takes the following form
(23)kmod=k0κDPmodκPPκRDmodκPmodκGB,
where kmod denotes the modified irradiated fuel thermal conductivity.
<Section>3. Results and discussion</Section>
The values of the parameters used in the present calculations are listed in Table 1.
Table 1. Values of various parameters used in the calculations
3.1. Porosity evolution
Fig. 1 obtained from the model given in (Roostaii et al., 2016), shows the calculated swelling porosityPS, as-fabricated porosityPv, and the total porosity P with the increasing burn-up at T = 700C compared with the measured data.
Fig. 1. Evolution of as-fabricated porosity Pv, swelling porosity Ps, and total porosity P as a function of burnup at 700 K compared with experimental data (Spino et al., 2006).
It is found that at high burnups due to the increase of gas bubble swelling resulting from the intergranular bubbles gathered in the recrystallized GB, the swelling porosity increases. This leads to an increase in the total porosity while the porosity due to as-fabricated pores falls with the onset of recrystallization at high burnups because the as-fabricated pores are filling with fission gas atoms and contribution of PV converts to that ofPs.
3.2. Modified porosity factor
Fig. 2 depicts the porosity factor given by Eq. (7) for two cases: a constant P (=0.05 as-fabricated porosity) compared to an evolving P. It is seen that the porosity factor decreases with increasing burnup once one accounts for the evolution of porosity with burnup, as expected.

3.3. Modified radiation damage factor
Fig. 3 displays the evolution of the modified radiation damage factor κRDmod with burnup for different temperatures. As can be seen, this factor remains constant until the onset of recrystallization process, then, after the recrystallization threshold burnup the modified radiation damage factor starts to increase, signaling the removal of radiation defects from the rim region of fuel matrix.

3.4. Modified dissolved fission products factor
The ratio of dissolved Xe atoms mass fraction to total mass fraction of all dissolved elements within the fuel matrix, FXe, is obtained from the data given in Table 1, Table 2.
Table 2. Mass fraction of dissolved elements in UO2 matrix in three burnups produced by MCNP code for a typical LWR.
The mass fractions of various dissolved elements in UO2 fuel matrix of a typical LWR for different burnups obtained from the MCNP analysis are given in Table 2. In addition, in the first row of Table 3, the total created Xe mass fraction in the UO2 matrix is given.
Table 3. Required data to determine FXe.
The fraction of Xe in dynamic solution, X(t), is defined as the ratio of the Xe concentration in dynamic solution (dissolved Xe atoms) to total created Xe, including dissolved Xe atoms plus Xe atoms in the intragranular bubbles and on the GBs (Eq. (25) in (Spino et al., 2005)). The obtained results for X(t) in different burnups given by (Spino et al., 2005) are shown in Table 2.
The dissolved Xe mass fraction given in the third row of Table 3 is obtained by multiplying mass fraction of total created Xe by X(t).
Finally FXe can be obtained from the division of the dissolved Xe mass fraction given in the third row of 3 by the sum of the total mass fraction in the last row of Table 2 with the dissolved Xe mass fraction itself, for each burnup.
As can be seen in Table 3, the estimated value for FXe remains nearly constant with burnup, so that in this work a value 0.13 is taken for the purpose of calculations.
Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the evolution of modified dissolved fission products factor, κDPmod, defined by Eq. (19) with burnup at T = 700 K compared to the Lucuta one κDP given by Eq. (4). It is seen that the decrease of modified factor κDPmod is less than that of κDP at high burnups due to depletion of Xe gas atoms from the fuel matrix, indicating a positive impact on the fuel rim region thermal conductivity.

Fig. 4(b) shows changes of modified dissolved fission products factor κDPmod as a function of burnup for different temperatures.
3.5. Grain boundary factor
Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the GB factor κGB with the increasing burnup for different temperatures. It is seen that this factor remains constant until the onset of recrystallization process, then, after the recrystallization threshold burnup, the factor starts decreasing due to decreasing the grain size.

3.6. UO2 fuel thermal conductivity
Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the evolution of UO2 thermal conductivity with burnup calculated by the modified Lucuta et al. model Eq. (24) at T = 500 K and T = 700 K, respectively compared with the original Lucata et al. one. To see the contribution of various factors to the thermal conductivity, we make the modifications through a four-level process. In the first level, the modification to the thermal conductivity model includes only the modified irradiation damage factor Eq. (18). The second level includes the modified dissolved fission products factor Eq. (19), in addition to the modified irradiation damage factor. In the third level, we include the modified porosity factor shown in Fig. 2, in addition to the two previous modified factors. In the fourth level, by including the GB factor Eq. (22), the modified thermal conductivity model is completed with all revised factors, including the modified irradiation damage factor, modified dissolved fission products factor, modified porosity factor, and a new GB factor.
Fig. 6. Modified thermal conductivity calculated with Eq. (23) as a function of burnup at a) 500 K and b) 700 K compared with the Lucuta model given by Eq. (1) and experimental data (Ronchi et al., 2004) and (Walker et al., 2006) through the four-level process; level1: modified radiation damage factor included, level2: modified radiation damage and dissolved fission products factors included, level3: radiation damage, dissolved fission products and modified porosity factors included, level4: the previous three factors plus the GB factor included. The error on the measured data is of the order of 7–9.4% (Ronchi et al., 2004) and ±5% (Walker et al., 2006).
According to Fig. 6, the modifications to the irradiation damage and dissolved fission products factors increase the thermal conductivity while, in contrast, the modified porosity and GB factors decrease it. From Fig. 6(a) and (b), it is clear that the deviation of calculated thermal conductivity from the measured data decreases (Ronchi et al., 2004) and (Walker et al., 2006) with the modified Lucuta et al. model compared to the original Lucuta et al. one. The experimental data from Ronchi et al. (2004) and Walker et al. (2006) used for validation are given in Table 4.
Table 4. Experimental data used for thermal conductivity at high burnup.
It is also seen that there is a decrease of about 15.5% in the thermal conductivity at a local burn-up of 120MWd/kgU, and at T = 700C compared to the original Lucuta model.
Fig. 7(a) to 7(d) show the UO2 thermal conductivity calculated by the Lucuta et al. model Eq. (1) and modified Lucuta et al. model Eq. (24) as a function of the temperature for different burnups compared with the measured data given by Ronchi et al. (2004) (see Table 4.).
Fig. 7. Modified thermal conductivity calculated with Eq. (23) vs. temperature for different burnups a) 34 MWd/kgU, b) 55 MWd/kgU, c) 82 MWd/kgU and d) 96 MWd/kgU, in comparison with the original Lucuta model of Eq. (1) and experimental data (Ronchi et al., 2004).
In Fig. 6, Fig. 7 the results of this work for comparison with the measured data were normalized from the 97% UO2 theoretical density to 95%.
It must be noted that the impact of nanometric intragranular bubbles having a comparable size with the phonon mean free path on the fuel thermal conductivity requires a separate model to analyze, as mentioned in (Nichenko and Staicu, 2014; Zhu et al., 2020). However, in the present work, this case is ignored since the role of all intragranular ones in the HBS condition is diminished.
3.7. Parametric study
The calculation of the thermal conductivity as performed in this work depends on the values of various parameters listed in Table 1, Table 3. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the sensitivities of the predicted thermal conductivity with any change in the key parameters used in the calculations. The results presented in the following figures were obtained by varying the chosen parameter only while keeping all others parameters at their reference values as given in Table 1, Table 3.
The calculated thermal conductivity versus burnup for three values FXe, is shown in Fig. 8. As expected, increasing the value of FXe leads to larger values of the modified dissolved fission products factor κDPmod (see Eq. (19)) and, thus, larger thermal conductivity values.
Fig. 8. The effect of FXevariations on thermal conductivity vs. burnup at 700 K.
In this work, for simplicity, a standard value of 1.5 was considered for the shape factor σ in the porosity factor accounting for the spherical uniformly dispersed porosity. However, it has been known that gas bubbles at the grain boundary have a lenticular shape (shape factor higher than 1.5), and the bubbles inside the grain and in the rim region of the high burnup UO2 fuel are sphere-shaped, in contrast, as-fabricated pores have an irregular shape and surfaces (Tarasov and Veshchunov, 2014; Marino, 1971; Morimoto and Ogasawara, 2017; Gibby, 1972; Spino et al., 2006; Khvostov et al., 2005; Walker et al., 1992). To see the influence of non-spherical pores on the thermal conductivity within our model, we plot Fig. 9 showing the calculated thermal conductivity versus burnup for various values of pore shape factor. It is seen that for larger values of σ than the standard one, the thermal conductivity decreases, as expected.

Fig. 10 illustrates the thermal conductivity as a function of the burnup for several recrystallized grains size, dgx. It shows that thermal conductivity increases with increasing recrystallized grains size.

Within the validity of the model considered in this work the parameters such as dg, f˙ show a very limited impact on the calculated thermal conductivity.
<Section>4. Conclusion</Section>
In this work, the Lucuta et al. thermal conductivity model of irradiated UO2 fuel was modified to take account of the HBS effect. The presented model combines separate effects as a modified porosity factor, modified radiation damage factor, modified dissolved fission products factor, precipitated fission products factor and a new GB factor.
It is found that at a local burn-up of 120MWd/kgU and temperature 700 K there is an increase in thermal conductivity of about 24% due to modification of the irradiation damage factor in level 1, which increases to 45% after modifying the dissolved fission product factor in level 2, as both effects play a positive role to increase the thermal conductivity of the rim region. The thermal conductivity undergoes a decrease of about 15.5% in comparison with the original Lucuta model after incorporating effects of the modified porosity and GB factors in level 3 and 4, respectively. The predicted thermal conductivity shows a reasonable agreement with the measured data in the rim region.
This work may be considered a pathway on how the HBS effect can be included in current thermal conductivity correlations.
