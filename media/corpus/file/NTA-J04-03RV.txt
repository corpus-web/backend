The potential for improving safety and systems efficiency via unit power reduction of NPP in spite of an increase of the specific costs is investigated. An approach to significant reduction of the risk due to the human factor by switching to small- and medium-size power-generating units is considered. This approach can be characterized as a method of risk reduction by means of ‘power insurance.’ The qualitative technical and economic effects from the reduction of different forms of risk in the implementation of small- and medium- size NPP designs as compared with large NPP are analyzed: public acceptance; search for investors and their financial risk; availability of NPP sites; cost increase due to longer construction times; radiation and nuclear safety risks; electric power interruptions; minimization of the reserve power in the power system; and, adaptability to the rate of regional energy growth. Variants of the classification of integral risks over the entire life cycle of an NPP design are presented.
The aim of the present article is to investigate the improvements gained in the safety and systems efficiency by low- ering the unit power capacity of power-generating units in spite of higher relative costs.
Man, nature, and the State are interconnected parts that are in synergistic interaction. The safety of any of the indi- cated subsystems must be considered together with the safety of the other parts and with the entire system. The source and carrier of these properties is the structure of the system: different properties arise from different structures of the systems comprised of one and the same elements [1]. Safety is a state of protection from numerous forms of danger. Absolute safety does not exist; safety is a normalized acceptable danger, a synergistic sum of numerous normalized acceptable forms of dan- ger. For safety security of a project, in power generation all forms of risk extant during preparation and their realization must be taken into account and, when possible, normalized. The sources of risk are non-uniform in space and time and can interact synergistically.
We shall examine the possible risks arising in the entire life cycle of NPP – from development and implementation of the design of the NPP to decommissioning. The risks arising over the life cycle of NPP can be distinguished as follows:
–technical – free design at the R&D stage, design, construction, operation, quality of work, classification, produc- tion, and technological;
–economic – investment, credit, finance, price, market, corruption, and reputation;
–institutional – political, normative-legislative, tax, licensing, personnel, control, corruption, reputation;
–nuclear and radiation – in the fuel cycle, under normal operating conditions, accidents, from spent nuclear fuel, wastes, chemical toxicity of employed materials, environmental damage, health, decommissioning.
Transport, property, and juridical risks are common to all of them [2]. Thus, there exist groups of risks with a limited sphere of influence, for example, technical, but there are also multigroup risks (corruption, reputation), but the human factor can become a source of risk in all spheres of activity.
The following risks exist at the strategic conception stage of NPP:–institutional – laws, norms, regulations, control of property;
–managerial – choice of strategy and types of reactor facilities, closed nuclear fuel cycle, NPP capacity range, deci- sion making system;
–infrastructure – extant structure of nuclear power, risk of loss of infrastructure, required systematicity, creation of excess infrastructure, for example, for participation in the international market for nuclear technologies;
at the experimental-design stage, design and construction:
–technical – premature commissioning of NPP, commissioning, operation, extension of operation and decommissioning;
–organizational – planning, finance, personnel;
–external – political, nature-geological; at the operation stage:
–external – natural disasters, climate change;
–institutional – change of laws, norms, and regulations;
–internal – organizational, personnel, motivation for safety;
–technical-technological – radiation, maintenance, outsourcing; at the NPP decommissioning stage:
–choice of strategy, radiation – large or small NPP, radioactive wastes (reprocessing, storage), dose load;
–economic – savings fund;
–infrastructure – personnel, laws, norms, technologies;
–reputation, in implementing export projects – strategy, nonproliferation regime, classification, company image;
–competition – government support, institutional – connection of normative-legal base.
Risks can be simple as well as multidirectional. Simple risks are determined by a complete list of non-intersecting events. Complex risks, as a rule, have intergroup links in terms of sources of appearance and consequences. Only a small fraction of the indicated risks can be regarded as simple in terms of their makeup. Analysis shows that about 90% of the risks are associated with the human factor.
It is believed that 70–80% of incidents at NPP are caused by personnel. For this reason, further development and improvement of the theory and practice of the impact of the human factor on the risk of incidents at NPP are needed [2–5]. All three large accidents – Three Mile Island (USA), Chernobyl, and Fukushima (Japan) – were a consequence of the human factor. The location of the Fukushima NPP and its design characteristics did not comport with the concept of protection-in-depth taking account of actions of natural and technogenic character. The impact of the human factor is inherent in all stages of the life cycle of NPP. Therefore, there must be a systems approach and the system must minimize anthropogenic risks or be in- sensitive to them. Practice has shown that there exists a risk of serious accidents, including accidents caused by the human factor. For this reason, preference must be given to facilities that guarantee minimal consequences.
We shall examine ways to overcome the impact of the human factor. It should be noted that the concept of ‘human factor’ includes both direct human participation in the initiation of an accident as well as participation via the adoption of incorrect technical solutions. If it is postulated that the human factor is an unavoidable source of risk in projects, then it is suggested that a low-risk system of nuclear power based on small and medium-size power-generating units be developed in order to reduce risk.
Let us examine the potential of a low-risk approach to designing large power-generating facilities – construction of several modular units for small and medium-size nuclear power plants on a single site instead of one large unit for an NPP but with the same total power figures. In this approach, the integral risk and the cost of eliminating its consequences decrease [6]. This approach can be called a power-capacity hedge-distribution of risk approach. By hedging we mean a form of insurance in- dicating that the responsibility for the contract is divided into several parts and redistributed between different insurance compa- nies. The total risk and responsibilities remain the same. The possible consequences and harm from risk are reduced several-fold by means of hedging and diversification. The technical economic basis of this method of power insurance is as follows:
–10-fold reduction of the individual power of a unit, for example, from 1000 to 100 MW, improves the integral safety 1000-fold, since there are 10 times fewer fission products and 10 times less stored potential energy; the remaining
TABLE 1. Basic Parameters of VVER-TOI, VBER-300, and VBER-100 Designscontribution is due to a change in the neutronic characteristics of the reactor and the possibility of heat-removal by natural means; the main advantage of small nuclear power plants in terms of safety is considered to be precisely the impact of the geometric dimensions and the possibility of passive heat removal [6];
–lower capital-intensiveness of the units of small and medium-size nuclear power plants makes it easier to find in- vestors, permits stepped commissioning of the power-generating units makes it possible to decrease the payback period of the capital investment due to shorter production times, gives an advantage in a regional energy planning, for example, on the site of the Kaliningrad NPP medium-size units would make it possible to avoid large losses arising from the rejection of a large unit [7]; in connection with the fact that several NPP modules can be built simultaneously and commissioned when ready, the risk of a cost increase due to longer construction time of the NPP decreases; the design features of small and medium-size nuclear power plants, especially plants built under factory conditions, make it possible to build them on a site in a high degree of readiness for operation, which reduces the time required to build, assemble, and debug the NPP; this also makes it possible to avoid risks with interruptions in electricity delivery and to reduce the requirements of power replacement, since n – 1 units remain in operation, if only one unit or one refueling must be stopped.

The modularity of small and medium-size nuclear power plants implies that the factory-built reactor unit is assem- bled on site. This approach makes it possible to organize large serial production of reactor monoblocks (10s per year), which reduces the cost of fabrication. Since large machine-building equipment is not required to fabricate a small-reactor mono- block, a competitive market of producers can be organized. This approach makes it possible to use typical methods of design- ing power-generating units with different capacity and flow methods of organizing the construction and assembly work. Together with the highly serial nature of production, this will reduce the specific cost of building power-generating units to a level comparable to similar figures for large units [8]. Three variants of achieving the same power on the NPP site are indicat- ed in Fig. 1: owing to the construction of one large unit with electric power 1250 MW (VVER-TOI) (1), four medium-size units VBER-300 each of size 312.5 MW (2), and 10 small units VBER-100 each of size 125 MW (3) provided that the sub- sequent VBER-300 and VBER-100 are built one year after the start of construction of the preceding unit and the parameters are those presented in Table 1 [9, 10].
It was assumed that the cost of electricity for the consumer is 0.08 c.u./(kW·h), the bank credit rate 5%, and the av- erage salary of personnel at the plant 1500 c.u./month. The cost of building 2–4 VBER-300 and 2–10 VBER-100 units is 10% lower than that of the first unit. These data are highly variable, so that the computational results should be treated as a quali- tative illustration only.
Analysis shows that in terms of cost there are no significant discrepancies between the examined variants, so that all additional advantages in terms of risk reduction for small and medium-size nuclear power plants remain in force. We shall now examine the attractiveness of the designs for investors. For this, we shall evaluate the examined designs in terms of the
reduced cost 20 years after project execution began, when the projects started to return a profit. We shall make an estimate us- ing the relation FV = PV(1 + R)n, where FV represents the yearly reduced investor expenses by year, PV represents the yearly
running investor expenses, R is the discount rate, and n is the time (in years) after money has been invested. The reduced cost 20 years after execution of the project began with discount rate 5 and 10% is equal to (109 c.u.): one VVER-TOI unit 10.9 and 22.3, four VBER-300 units 11.4 and 22.6, and 10 VBER-100 units 10.9 and 20.6, respectively. As we can see from the calculations, the most interesting project for investors is the construction of 10 VBER-100 units with discount rate 5%.
A variant of the use of small nuclear power plants in large centralized energy systems as an alternative to units with high unit power is under study abroad [11]. Currently, in choosing a design attention is focused first on the specific capital costs, which is not always expedient. In addition, the longest period of the life cycle of NPP operation in terms of risk attracts the least attention while the shortest period – construction and its cost – attracts the most attention. The cost should be calcu- lated for the entire life cycle of the project. The proposed avenue for adopting small and medium-size nuclear power plants
TABLE 2. Primary Risks for Small and Large Unitscan be characterized briefly as follows: currently, more resources could be required but then there will be fewer risks. The lack of methods for making a quantitative assessment of the total risk and a systems approach to it makes it impossible at present to evaluate and adopt this avenue for realizing a low-risk nuclear-power system (Table 2).
Risks in nuclear power are burdensome. The probability of a serious accident is very low but it has an enormous economic and public resonance. It is suggested that the method of hedging by distributing the risk over power by switching from a large power-generating unit to small or medium-sized power units. It technical and economic impacts have been shown qualitatively – in many cases the construction of large power-generating units will be irrational from the standpoint of con- trolling risk and economic efficiency because of the nominally long construction times, high risk of an increase of the con- struction time of NPP, high сost of downtime, and replacement capacity requirements.
