Graphene acts as a sputter shield against low energy helium and deuterium plasmas.
High ion fluences can limit the functional range for graphene coatings.
Tungsten fuzz growth can be slowed down by coating polished surfaces with graphene.
<Section>Abstract</Section>
In the presence of irradiation by energetic ions, plasma facing components (PFCs) tend to develop surface morphologies that lead to mass loss of the wall material, potentially diminishing their lifetime and plasma performance. We explore the performance of graphene as a coating for plasma facing components to protect against sputtering due to low-energy ions. We show that graphene can slow changes in surface morphology of tungsten subjected to energetic-helium and deuterium ion bombardment over a wide range of energies, as tested in the PISCES-A facility at UC-San Diego. We exposed tungsten samples half-coated with graphene in the PISCES-A facility, at energies of 40 and 140 eV and fluences ranging from 1 × 1024 - 3.6 × 1025 ions/m2. We found that tungsten “fuzz” growth at high fluences (1024–1025 He-D/m2) can be reduced by approximately 30%. At the lower fluence and energy, no fuzz formed. Using scanning electron microscopy and focused-ion beam machining, we investigate these changes in surface morphology. Deuterium results do not show the graphene defect production to be as energy or fluence dependent as helium bombardment. We determine damage to and the lifetime of the graphene membrane with Raman spectroscopy for vacuum components subjected to such extreme environmental conditions.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The need for materials for plasma facing components (PFCs) is rising because of their limiting effect on plasma performance. In the presence of plasmas, PFCs tend to develop surface morphologies that lead to mass loss of the material, potentially diminishing the lifetime and safety of a reactor. Because of its properties as a refractory metal, tungsten (W) has become a leading candidate for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Many groups have investigated sputtering of W by helium over a wide range of energies, temperatures, and fluences [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], including energies ranging from tens of eV's to tens of keV's, temperatures extending from 30 to 2700 °C, and fluences up to 1 × 1027 He+/m2 [which are still below the expected fluences in large-scale fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)]. Irradiation by helium creates vacancies and interstitials in the W lattice, which eventually lead to changes in surface morphology, erosion, and mass loss. Diffusion of helium leads to clusters and helium bubbles, which can lead to blistering [7,11], tungsten fuzz, [12], [13], [14] or other morphology changes [9], [10], [11] on the surface of the material.
In this work we use single-layer graphene as a protective layer on the surface of polycrystalline tungsten to investigate the development of these surface structures. Graphene is a 2-dimensional carbon allotrope that has a very tightly packed sp2 honeycomb structure, which leads to the smallest bond distance between carbon atoms of 1.42 Å [15]. This structure demonstrates extraordinary properties valuable in many areas of science and engineering. In particular, relevant for the current investigation, the radiation resistance of graphene has been studied, both experimentally and numerically, over a wide range of bombardment energies and ion species [16,17] and there is agreement on the resilience of graphene under these extreme conditions.
We have previously demonstrated [18] that, for high-energy helium ion bombardment (30 keV), graphene is able to suppress the development of surface morphologies, while reducing mass losses of W by an order of magnitude. Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the membrane and determine that the defect ratio (ID/IG), a measure of the damage to the graphene, remains low after these ion exposures. Åhgren et al. [19] showed that by increasing the energy of incoming ions, the sputtering yields of free-standing graphene become close to zero for helium. More recently, Herbig and Michely [20] determined that for ionized noble gasses (200–500 eV), a single-layer graphene coating on single-crystalline iridium can suppress the sputtering of the substrate metal by about two orders of magnitude for substrate bulk temperatures above 1000 K. They concluded that this protection mechanism is dominated by self-repair of the radiation damage in graphene, which occurs at temperatures where CVD growth is performed, and can be maintained as long as there is a hydrocarbon partial pressure in the chamber. Ahlberg et al. [21] investigated defect formation in graphene during low-energy argon ion beam bombardment at energies ranging from 5 to 200 eV, demonstrating that ions with energies below 25 eV will not impart enough energy into a graphene carbon atom to introduce single-vacancy defects. As the energy is increased beyond this threshold for sputtering, defects are introduced into the membrane up to certain energies, at which point, a smaller number of ions interact with the graphene atoms, leading again to a reduced defect ratio. This study has also found a trend of increasing ID/IG vs ion dose and kinetic energy, demonstrating the membrane will eventually fail, although this could be highly dependent on the underlying substrate and process temperature, such as that observed by Herbig and Michely [20]. These experiments should be repeated for deuterium and helium because, owing to their mass differences, the incoming energy transfer to a carbon atom is much less than that of argon to carbon. Here, we study the effects of low-energy helium plasma bombardment capable of introducing single-vacancy defects into a graphene membrane (>30 eV) and large implantation doses (>1024 He+/m2) and study the durability of the membrane and the tungsten substrate.
<Section>2. Material and methods</Section>
Samples of 99.95% polycrystalline tungsten (PCW), in the form of 2.5 cm diameter, 2 mm thick disks provided by Edge Tech ™ (1141 Holland Dr # 1, Boca Raton, FL 33,487), were polished using silicon carbide (from 60 to 1200 grit) and finished with a 1 µm particle sized diamond suspension, to a mirror polished surface. The samples are then electropolished in a solution of 2 wt.% KOH dissolved in deionized water. A graphite rod is used as a cathode and the metal sample acts as the anode. A magnetic stirrer is used for even etching. The samples are dipped for 20 s at different voltages (i.e. 17, 20, 25 V). The solution ions are attracted to the metal surface and preferentially etch away surface atoms, revealing the material grains and boundaries. This removes any residual damage caused by the mechanical polishing process, providing a smooth surface finish, with scattered protuberances on the order of 100 nm [22]. The samples are then rinsed with deionized water and ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol to rid the surface of any impurities. Samples were then marked with a diamond scorer to determine the sample orientation and regions for coating with graphene. Single-layer graphene was grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on 30 µm thick Cu (99.99% purity) at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 1030 °C for 2 h, with a hydrogen (5% H2, 95% Ar) flowrate of 500 sccm and a methane (5% CH4, 95% Ar) flowrate of 10.5 sccm. The graphene is then coated with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and the graphene/Cu combination placed in a FeCl3 bath, which etches the copper, leaving the graphene/PMMA suspended in the solution. The graphene/PMMA is then transferred to the tungsten substrates, the PMMA is removed with acetone, the surface is cleaned with isopropanol and then rinsed with deionized water, and the quality of the transfer is checked via Raman spectroscopy. Only one half of the surface of the PISCES-A samples is coated with graphene for a direct sample comparison (Fig. 1).
<Section>3. Experimental</Section>
The samples described above are mounted in the Linear Divertor Experiment PISCES-A [14,23,24] at the University of California-San Diego. This device allows exploration of materials properties or processes using low-energy ions ranging from 40 to 250 eV, fluences ranging from 1023 to 1026 ions/m2, and sample temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 °C, for various ion species; in this study, deuterium and helium. PISCES-A utilizes a dense plasma column with electron temperatures of approximately 50 eV, and ion temperatures of 20 eV. Ions are then accelerated by biasing the target plate to the desired potential. The target plate holds samples of 2.5 cm diameter disks that are 2 mm thick. These samples are actively cooled, with the temperature set by manipulating the cooling parameters. The plasma flux is measured via fiber optics connected to the target plate. The implantation data for the samples are summarized in Table 1.

4.1. Damage to graphene by exposure to helium and deuterium ions
Raman spectroscopy is widely used to characterize graphene because of its sensitivity to defect properties. The Raman spectrum for graphene has three main peaks: the D band (the defect band), which arises from a transverse optical-mode phonon created by a crystal lattice defect, the G band, which comes from a normal first-order Raman scattering process (this is always present in graphene), and the 2D band, which is a second-order Raman scattering process also always present in graphene. The ratio of the D band and the G band is commonly used to determine crystal defects and the quality of the membrane (referred to as the damage ratio), whereas the ratio of the 2D to the G band is used to determine the number of layers present (I2D/IG>2 corresponds to single-layer graphene) [25]. A shift of the G band from ~1586 cm−1 (nominal location for defect-free graphene), to 1550 cm−1 along with the disappearance of the 2D band corresponds to complete amorphization of the graphene, or failure.
We averaged the damage ratio for the graphene measured between 4 and 10 different regions of the samples via a 532 nm DXRxi Raman imaging microscopy (confocal point size of 25 m) before and after plasma exposure. After the exposure the surfaces start to roughen and this increases noise in the output signal, which can cloud some of the graphene signature in the region map. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectrum for one of the samples before (a) and after (b) a deuterium ion exposure. The red line denotes the wave number for complete amorphization of the graphene membrane (decrease from ~1586 to 1550 cm−1). Ion exposure is accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the 2D band located at ~2700 cm−1, which indicates that there is a decrease in the island size of the graphene membrane, and in turn coverage of the surface. Single vacancies are being produced in the membrane, which is denoted by an increase in the defect band, D, at ~1350 cm−1.

For pristine graphene, the D band is located at ~1350 cm−1, the G band at ~1600 cm−1, and the 2D band at ~2700 cm−1. The red line denotes the wave number to which the G band needs to shift for complete graphene amorphization. (b) Raman spectra of sample GP5 after exposure with 140 eV deuterium ions. The D band has increased and the 2D band has decreased. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the change in the graphene damage ratio for these exposures as a function of energy or fluence, respectively. In the case of ions accelerated by a bias voltage (e.g. PISCES-A), secondaries largely neutralize the incoming ions, resulting in a low ionization degree [26]. However, the resulting neutrals are expected to maintain the same energies as the ions the electrons attach to, and the damage to any Debye shielded carbon atoms may be similar to that for ion-only bombardment. The interaction resulting between free electrons and graphene is more difficult to quantify, due to the difficulty in calculating the actual incoming electron temperature in PISCES. However, low-energy plasma electrons can interact with graphene electrons to heat the sheet, resulting in damage.
Fig. 3. Graphene damage as a function of ion energy for graphene coated W samples. GP2/3 and GP5/6 are respectively irradiated by helium and deuterium ions. A higher ID/IG implies more damage. The red line corresponds to the damage required for failure of the graphene. Smaller variations on the global damage ratio are not seen in the helium error bars at high energies. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Fig. 4. Graphene damage as a function of irradiating species fluence for graphene coated W. GP1/2 and GP4/5 are respectively irradiated by helium and deuterium ions. The different samples show that an increase in fluence appears to have a more significant effect on the damage ratio of the graphene membrane than the ion energy for an initially undamaged membrane. Sample GP1, exposed to ~3.4 × 1025 He+/m2 failed, indicating the failure limit was reached for that specific plasma condition.
The small error bars in Fig. 3 suggest a more uniform distribution of damage across the surface only due to physical sputtering processes, as opposed to deuterium ion bombardment, which could manifest itself in damage variations due to chemical sputtering along larger defect sites (localized). An increase in helium energy shows lower damage to the graphene than an equivalent increase in deuterium energy, possibly due to helium's larger energy transfer factor (@ vs @).
The highest-fluence run in PISCES (GP1) caused the graphene membrane to fail, introducing numerous defects, a large damage ratio, and amorphization of the remaining carbon bonds (red shift of the Raman spectrum) across the substrate surface. Although that irradiation involved the use of helium ions, the trend shown in Fig. 4 suggests the same would happen for D, for ion energies of 140 eV. The energy dependence of the damage ratio shown in Fig. 3 suggests the same would be true across the whole energy range. Thus, it appears that the fluence that single-layer graphene can sustain in this energy range is ~3 × 1025 ions/m2. For lower exposures the G peak remains in the same position (~1586 cm−1), while the D peak intensity increases, indicating that single-vacancy production in graphene may be dominant here.
Deuterium exposures did not produce as large a number of defects as we expected from the ease of forming hydrocarbons with graphitic materials. The G-band for these exposures did not red shift but did broaden, and the D band intensity rose, suggesting that the deuterium ions are introducing defects into the membrane as single vacancies, but the broadening of the G-band suggests that these ions are also slowly amorphizing the graphene, forming sp3 bonds in the defect sites and stabilizing the structure [27], [28], [29].
A comparison between the reflection coefficients for 40 and 140 eV helium ions on a tungsten surface shows that the reflection probability increases as the ion energy decreases, from approximately 50% for 140 eV, to ~80% for 40 eV [30,31]. The 140 eV helium ions are able to be implanted deeper into the tungsten and have a lower probability of reflection, which, when exiting the membrane due to backscattering, could introduce defects. These ions also have a smaller nuclear cross section compared to their 40 eV counterparts, leading to a decreased interaction with the graphene when initially going through the sheet. The combination of these two effects can explain the decrease in the graphene damage seen in Fig. 3. The 40 eV ions have both a higher reflection coefficient and a larger nuclear cross section, which can promote sputtering of the carbon atoms in the graphene membrane. Both of these occur in conjunction with tungsten sputtering, although it is not possible to determine at the present time what percentage of the damage is caused by each different process.
4.2. Surface morphology changes
Tungsten fuzz growth is significantly reduced when graphene covers the surface. To understand the phenomenon better, we used focused-ion beam (FIB) etching to create cross sections of the W samples which were used to determine the thickness of the fuzz. Cross sections of samples GP1 and GP2 were FIB milled. Fig. 5 shows an example cross section used for the measurement of the fuzz thickness on sample GP1 using the FIB built-in analysis functions. Multiple areas were cut into both sides of the samples (graphene coated side and non-coated side) in order to determine the average thickness of the surface fuzz, and on each, 6 measurements were taken. Table 6-2 summarizes the results of these measurements, revealing a significant reduction of the fuzz growth.
Fig. 5. Sample FIB cuts of (a) graphene coated side of W sample GP1 as seen in the focused ion beam and fuzz thickness measurements. (b) Bare side of W sample GP1. The average fuzz thickness on the graphene coated side was measured to be smaller than that of the bare tungsten side of the same sample across both sample GP1 and GP2. Sample GP3, exposed to lower fluence and ion energy, did not develop fuzz on the surface.
Table 2. Summary of run parameters and measurement of fuzz thickness for He bombardment.
Measurements averaged across multiple regions for sample GP1 showed that the growth rate of the fuzz in the graphene-coated area is reduced by approximately 30%. This effect is further seen on sample GP2, where, for a lower fluence, the fuzz thickness is reduced by close to 40%. Once the graphene in GP1 has been completely amorphized and thus its power to act like graphene destroyed, it becomes easier for the fuzz to grow and helium to escape. While sample GP2 also demonstrated an increase in the graphene damage ratio, the graphene retains its structure as described by the lack of a shift of the G-band. This indicates that the removal of carbon from graphene is introducing defects to the hexagonal lattice, but not to the degree of GP1, where the fuzz thickness is larger. The mechanisms for erosion of a bare and a graphene coated W sample are summarized in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively.
Fig. 6. Helium ion bombardment of bare polycrystalline W. A low-energy helium ion has a large Coulomb cross section for scattering with W atoms. At these energies, Coulomb energy transfer still dominates nuclear elastic scattering, because it is difficult for an ion to overcome the Coulomb force and get sufficiently close to the other ion for the nuclear force to come into play. Helium builds up in the sub-surface layer and, combined with high mobility due to high substrate temperatures, coalesces into helium bubbles. These diffuse to the surface and create thin “fuzz” tendrils due to enhanced helium mobility along the surface, and a thick fuzz layer. Enough helium needs to be implanted for these structures to develop, as much as 1 × 1024 He+/m2.
Fig. 7. Helium ion bombardment of graphene-coated polycrystalline W. A low-energy helium ion has a large Coulomb cross section for scattering with W atoms. The ions can also interact with the carbon atoms in the graphene membrane, transferring enough energy to create single-vacancy defects. In addition to creating these defects, helium also builds up in the sub-surface layer and, combined with high mobility due to high substrate temperatures, coalesces into helium bubbles. These bubbles diffuse to the surface but are prevented from escaping due to the added layer of the graphene atoms, creating a rough surface. As more defects are introduced in the graphene, thick fuzz tendrils and a thin fuzz layer form. At extremely high fluences of low-energy ions, the graphene layer fails, and the fuzz starts to grow at the same rate as it would for bare W.
The conditions explored in this study are comparable to the ones expected during initial operation of ITER for non-burning plasma conditions [32]. Peak divertor fluxes are expected to be on the order of ~5 × 1023 ions/m2-s, only on the cases of burning plasma operation, an order of magnitude higher than tested. This is not expected to be the case for all shots during the second phase of operation for the reactor, where deuterium and tritium will be utilized, because there will be significant variation in the conditions of the shots. More than 80% of the total plasma exposure will take place during secondary operation. The initial phase comprising the rest of the particle fluxes plans for hydrogen and helium plasmas, with significantly lower particle fluxes (few orders of magnitude), and energies, which can be comparable to what we have presented, and to what has been proposed by the JET ITER-like wall at least for the deuterium tritium operation. These experiments have demonstrated an approximate particle impact angle of 60°, and inter-ELM plasma temperatures in the range of ~35–200 eV [33], similar to conditions here. Assuming that the initial phase is operating at divertor particle fluxes which are two orders of magnitude lower than the burning plasma phase, due to the unpredictability of the operating conditions during the initial phase, the graphene is expected to last through these initial ~10,000 pulses. The particle energies in this phase are projected to be much lower as well, and this motivates a more detailed parametric study for such conditions, as graphene reflects a significant fraction of hydrogen [27] and is impermeable to low-energy helium [21] for energies below 25 eV. In addition, although this study demonstrates the effects at normal incidence, the penetration depth of particles into the material will be less overall at glancing incidence, but forward scattering is larger, and the ions will escape and not deposit all their energy. This phenomenon is seen in thin film growth at glancing angle deposition and has been patented [34]. Results on angled incidence suggest that physical sputtering does not dominate over near-surface helium build-up in producing morphology-change initiated mass loss on PFC's [35]. Any subsequent damage to the graphene should then be mainly a result of the surface modification, although sputtering from highly energetic and massive surface particles can also contribute to the damage, and the graphene should remain transparent to the significantly smaller helium.
<Section>Conclusions</Section>
Reflection and backscattering of atoms are two important processes that can introduce a significant number of defects into the graphene membrane, with lower-energy helium ions (40 eV) being responsible for higher defect production in addition to tungsten sputtering in the surface layer. However, for a fixed fluence to the plasma facing component, a higher helium ion bombardment energy can make the graphene more durable, extending its lifetime. For tungsten as a plasma facing component, this also assists in reducing the development of surface morphologies which are detrimental to plasma performance in those extreme environments. High helium fluences also appear to have an effect on the damage to the membrane, and the destructive dose (failure) is dependent on ion energy. Deuterium exposure appears to have a different effect on damaging the graphene due to the hydrogen isotope's ability to produce defects as well as stabilizing the defect site by forming sp3 bonds with the carbon atoms. During a deuterium plasma exposure, the graphene damage does not change significantly as a function of energy for low incoming energies. This work indicates that the limiting species for a fusion plasma exposure is helium, not deuterium. While the deuterium fluences explored here did not reveal the failure limit for the membranes, this is something to address in future studies as well as the effect of lower-energy (<30 eV) helium plasma exposures and high fluence on a graphene membrane, as these particles may not have enough energy to dislocate carbon atoms in the sheet, potentially extending the lifetime of components even more.
