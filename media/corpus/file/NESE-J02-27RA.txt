Transitioning US nuclear fleet to a closed fuel cycle can be achieved during the period when the current reactors need replacement.
This closed fuel cycle would require 1% as much front-end resources and yield 5% as much waste compared to the existing cycle.
Such a transition would require a significant inventory of fissile material such as U/Pu from recycled used fuel or HALEU.
The use of HALEU may be more favorable because it is less constrained and may be more economical.
<Section>Abstract</Section>
This paper presents the major takeaways from studies conducted over several years that were focused on transitioning the U.S. nuclear infrastructure from the current once-through fuel cycle to one in which fuel is continuously recycled in fast reactors. These studies involved simulating and analyzing numerous example scenarios of fuel cycle transition with various assumptions on technology, policy, and material utilization strategies. Among the many findings, perhaps the most important is that under certain conditions, the use of high-assay low-enriched uranium to start up a fleet of fast reactors may be more favorable compared to using recycled Pu from thermal reactors since it is less constrained by other technologies and may even be more economical.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The current once-through nuclear fuel cycle in the U.S. was developed mostly by default rather than by a specific plan. In the early years of the nuclear era, a wide range of possible nuclear fuel cycles and their associated technologies were conceived and tested (INEEL, 2000). The original 1942 Chicago pile that demonstrated a controlled nuclear chain reaction was a thermal reactor using natural uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. The first electricity generating reactor (EBR-I – 1951) was a fast breeder reactor using enriched uranium built to verify the potential for a closed fuel cycle. The thorium fuel cycle was also explored with a thermal boiling water reactor (BORAX-IV – 1956). However, the early success of the U.S. naval propulsion program and the associated large research investment in light water-cooled thermal reactors (LWRs) using enriched uranium has resulted in the U.S. using only this fuel cycle for all of its civilian nuclear energy (currently 98 reactors in operation). The vast majority of the rest of the world’s civilian reactors (about 340 (WNA, 2020)) are also based on this fuel cycle. Many LWRs around the world and all in the U.S. currently operate within an open-ended once-through fuel cycle in which uranium is mined, enriched, used once as fuel in reactors, and then expected to be directly disposed.
In the once-through fuel cycle, reactors consume (fission) less than 1% of the original uranium mined; the other ~99% of the uranium is ultimately destined for disposal as waste. It has been well-established that this fuel cycle is one of the least efficient ways to utilize uranium resources for nuclear power and to minimize the amount of generated waste. Other fuel cycles that include fast reactors and continuous recycling of the fuel can potentially use almost all of the mined uranium in a closed-loop nuclear fuel cycle that consumes 99% less uranium and produces 95% less high level waste versus the open-ended once-through cycle. The early commercial success of LWRs made it hard for other types of reactors to enter the market.
The 98 LWRs that provide nearly 20% of the U.S. electricity were mostly built in the 1970s and 1980s and almost all are currently licensed to operate for 60 years, with a few initial license extensions to 80 years in process (NRC, 2019). With virtually no new builds for the last several decades, the potential large-scale replacement of these reactors in the next 20–40 years presents a unique opportunity to reconsider the type of fuel cycle used in the U.S.
Given this context, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE) chartered an evaluation and screening of nuclear fuel cycle options to provide information on the potential benefits and challenges of the full range of fuel cycle options. The results, published in 2014, confirmed that continuous recycle fuel cycles offered the greatest potential benefits, especially in the areas of improved uranium utilization and waste reduction (FCRD, 2014).
After publication of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening report, follow-on studies examined how to transition the nuclear power infrastructure in the U.S. to support a closed fuel cycle in which the fuel is continuously recycled. This paper summarizes the main findings from those transition studies which were detailed in several DOE internal technical reports and conference publications (Feng, 2012, Passerini et al., 2015, Feng, 2016a, Feng, 2016b, Hoffman, 2016a, Hoffman, 2016b, Hoffman, 2016c, Fei et al., 2017, Feng et al., 2017, Hiruta, 2019) generated during five years of research across several national laboratories.
<Section>2. Background</Section>
For context, it is noted that this paper is written to present typical cases and primary results. In a topic area as complex as nuclear energy, there are many alternatives beyond the cases presented in this paper. It was not necessary to address every case to provide the main features and findings of transition, so they have been omitted for brevity and clarity.
2.1. The three types of fuel cycles
The nuclear fuel cycle is the process of providing fresh fuel for nuclear reactors and managing the fuel after it is used. This includes uranium and/or thorium mining and fuel fabrication on the front end and either disposal or recycling the fuel on the back end. There are three basic types of fuel cycles, as illustrated with specific technology examples in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 31: once-through, limited recycle, and continuous recycle. All of the possible fuel cycles from a physics perspective can be categorized into one of these three types, and these examples served as the starting point for all fuel cycle transition assessments and calculations that were performed during this multi-year study.

Fig. 2. Typical limited recycle fuel cycle.
Fig. 3. Typical continuous recycle fuel cycle.
In the open-ended once-through fuel cycle, fuel discharged from reactors is destined for packaging and disposal in geologic repositories and is considered to be spent nuclear fuel. If the discharged fuel were to be recycled, either in limited form or continuous, it would be considered used nuclear fuel. Due to the absence of recycling, the once-through LWR fuel cycle consumes only ~0.6% of the initial uranium mined and throws away the other 99.4% as depleted uranium (tails from the enrichment process) or unfissioned uranium in the spent fuel. Discharged fuel from LWRs, is typically composed of ~93% fertile 238U, 5% fission products, 1.2% plutonium (bred from neutron capture2 in 238U), ~0.8% residual fissile 235U, and 0.1% minor actinides3.
In the limited recycle fuel cycle, the used fuel can be recycled into new fresh fuel in a closed loop to recover the fissile value in the plutonium while sending most of the uranium and optionally the minor actinides to the waste stream. This plutonium can be reloaded into current light water reactors, replacing the enriched uranium as the primary fuel. However, it is only practical to do this process once, with the resulting spent fuel no longer having enough fissile material to continue. This limited recycle fuel cycle, which can be considered to be “partially closed”, increases the uranium consumption of LWRs from 0.6% to ~0.8%, but still leaves over 99% of the original uranium to be thrown away. The limited recycle fuel cycle is currently practiced in France, Russia, and Japan; the United Kingdom ceased its reprocessing activities at the Thorp plant in 2018. These three countries have established nuclear energy and the recycling infrastructure that also enables them to recycle fuel from other countries, which some have.
The third type of fuel cycle, continuous recycle, depends on the breeding of new fissile material from the over 99% of uranium that is fertile. In the continuous recycle fuel cycle, only natural or depleted uranium needs to be loaded into reactors since the primary fissile material is in plutonium that is bred from fertile uranium via neutron capture. This requires a break even or greater than one breeding ratio, creating at least as much fissile material as is consumed. This in turn requires the use of fast reactors for fuel cycles based on uranium/plutonium fuel4.
2.2. Thermal reactors and fast reactors
Fig. 4 shows the number of neutrons produced by fission for each neutron that is absorbed in fuel (either through fission or capture) by each of the three main fissile isotopes used in nuclear fuels as a function of the incident neutron energy. This value is known as η and must be greater than two in breeder reactors because one neutron is needed to sustain the chain reaction by causing fission in another fissile isotope and another is needed to convert a fertile atom into a fissile atom through neutron capture, thereby replacing the fissile atom that was lost from the fission. Some additional margin is needed to account for neutrons lost through absorption in other materials (fission products, structural materials, poisons, etc.) and through leaking out of the core. Note that for the fast neutron energy range, the η values are significantly higher compared to those in the thermal or intermediate ranges, especially for the 239Pu that is created from fertile 238U. This fundamentally enables fast spectrum reactors to be much better suited for continuous recycling compared to thermal reactors.

<Section>3. Fuel cycle assessment</Section>
At the beginning of the atomic age, uranium was scarce and there was concern that the only sustainable fuel cycle was the closed continuous recycle fuel cycle. However, as more uranium was discovered these initial concerns were alleviated and water cooled thermal reactors designed for nuclear powered submarines provided much of the technology for the initial commercial power reactors.
As construction of thermal reactors for electricity generation grew, concern about uranium sufficiency was raised again. Some countries started recycling commercial fuel to reclaim fissile material as a step toward closing the fuel cycle while fast reactor research continued. A number of studies on fuel cycles were also performed. The largest was the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, conducted in the late 1970s [INFCE, 1980], which confirmed the uranium utilization benefits of a continuous recycle fuel cycle based on fast reactors.
Concurrent to the INFCE study, growing cost overruns for all nuclear construction in the U.S. and Europe and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident contributed to a significant reduction in commercial nuclear growth and associated concerns about uranium availability. A 2006 NEA retrospective assessment of uranium resources and demand showed that while the use of uranium had grown considerably over the previous 40 years, identification of new uranium deposits had grown faster and more known reserves were now available [NEA, 2006]5.
3.1. The nuclear fuel cycle Evaluation and Screening study
In late 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) chartered a new, comprehensive evaluation and screening of nuclear fuel cycle options to provide information on the potential benefits and challenges of the full range of possible fuel cycles. The study assessed ~4,400 possible fuel cycle groups based on the three basic types of fuel cycles, the number of stages in the fuel cycle, the neutron spectrum used in each stage, the type of fertile and fissile materials used, and what elements were recycled. These options were organized into 40 evaluation groups based on common physics characteristics that were evaluated for performance in 9 areas, including resource utilization, waste management, safety, economics and environmental impacts, using 25 individual ‘metrics’. The results of this fuel cycle assessment [FCRD, 2014] reconfirmed that continuous recycle fuel cycles offered the greatest potential benefits, especially in the areas of reducing natural resource (uranium) usage and reducing the generation of waste requiring geologic disposal.
The Evaluation and Screening study also considered multiple perspectives on what is most important in a fuel cycle, giving different weights to performance in the different evaluation areas. Changing these weights resulted in changes in the highest performing fuel cycles, but under all weighting scenarios, the same 4 fuel cycles consistently came out at the top.
These four “most promising” fuel cycles are all based on continuous recycling of uranium and plutonium and differ only by: 1) whether they use break-even fast reactors or a balanced combination of breeder fast reactors and burner thermal reactors, and 2) whether the “minor actinides” neptunium, americium and curium are also recycled. The minor actinides are created in reactors through neutron absorption and contribute little to energy generation but give off a lot of radiation and heat, making fresh fuel harder and more costly to fabricate if they are recycled but leaving the nuclear waste more radioactive for a longer period if they are instead disposed.
<Section>4. Transition analysis</Section>
The Evaluation and Screening effort identified the most promising fuel cycles, but did not investigate the best ways to switch to them. With the completion of the Evaluation and Screening, a series of scenario studies were conducted to better understand how to phase out the current nuclear infrastructure that would no longer be needed if such a transition were to occur, while phasing in a fleet of fast reactors and the associated fuel cycle facilities for fuel fabrication and recycling6. The transition analysis focused on the period of infrastructure transition, as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Conceptual transition time profile.
General assumptions used in the transition studies included:
•
Nuclear energy will continue as part of the U.S. energy mix far into the future, so transition to a more efficient continuous recycle fuel cycle is worthwhile.
•
Total U.S. nuclear electricity generation would either stay constant (zero growth) at the current level or would grow at a steady rate to maintain or increase market share. The current level is ~800 billion kilowatt-hours per year, which is ~20% of total generation from all sources. Zero growth was investigated because it simplified the calculations and made it easier to identify most characteristics of transition, while steady growth was also investigated to identify growth limiting constraints.
•
Current thermal reactors were assumed to operate until the end of their licensed lifetimes. They would not be shut down early to make room for fast reactors. Retirements would begin in 2030 (current 60 year licenses) or 2050 (licenses extended to 80 years). All new reactors built in the future would operate for 80 years.
•
Fast reactors and recycling facilities would become available after 2030. Two rates of fast reactor introduction were considered:
Slow introduction allows for learning from the construction and operation of the initial reactors before building more. However, it significantly extends transition time because some retiring reactors of the current fleet are replaced by new thermal reactors that then operate for another 80 years.
Fast introduction replaces retiring thermal reactors with fast reactors, which reduces transition time and gains the full benefits of the continuous recycle fuel cycle earlier.
The remainder of this paper summarizes the main findings from these studies, organized by topical area.
<Section>5. Primary findings</Section>
5.1. When closed fuel cycle benefits begin
The primary benefits of closing the fuel cycle are significantly reducing the amount of natural uranium needed per unit of energy produced and reducing the amount of waste that is hazardous enough for a long enough time to require geologic isolation.
Reduction in the usage of natural uranium occurs gradually as the transition proceeds and some (breed/burn system) or all (breakeven system) of the thermal reactors are replaced by fast reactors:
•
For the continuous recycle fuel cycles based on break even fast reactors, the full benefit is achieved when the transition is completed and there are no more thermal reactors. At that point, the fast reactors only require a source of fertile uranium to make up for the fissile material that is consumed. The U.S. currently has huge inventories of depleted uranium that, in a zero growth case, can fill this need for at least the next 3,000 years without additional uranium mining.
•
For the continuous recycle fuel cycles based on fast breeder reactors and thermal burner reactors, the full benefit is achieved when there are enough fast reactors producing enough excess fissile material to fully satisfy the needs of the remaining thermal reactors and no more uranium mining is needed. Again, this occurs when transition is complete and all the reactors are running on recycled fuel plus small amounts of natural or depleted uranium to make up for consumption.
A reduction in the amount of nuclear waste requiring geologic disposal occurs on paper as soon as a decision is made to recycle nuclear fuel and is physically realized when recycling begins. In other words, once recycling LWR fuel becomes an official policy, the “spent nuclear fuel” would leave the “waste” category and move into the “resource” category as “used nuclear fuel”. The timing to initiate recycle depends on whether the plutonium in thermal reactor used fuel is used to start up the fast reactors or enriched uranium is used. If plutonium is used, the full benefit is achieved as soon as the recycling capacity exceeds the rate of used fuel generation, which may occur even before the first fast reactor is completed. If enriched uranium is used, the benefit will be incurred gradually as the transition proceeds and thermal reactors are phased out.
5.2. Amount of fuel material needed on a continuing basis
To feed the current U.S. once-through fuel cycle system, ~190 metric tons (MT) of natural uranium is needed per gigawatt-year (~9 billion kilowatt-hours) of electricity produced.7 For each gigawatt of electricity generation capacity, ~90 MT of fuel material8 is needed in the reactor. To refuel the reactors, ~20 MT of ~ 4.2% fissile enriched uranium is needed per gigawatt each year. To produce 20 MT of 4.2% enriched uranium requires ~190 MT of natural uranium, of which over 170 MT becomes depleted uranium for discard. The majority of the spent fuel planned for disposal is also uranium. The current U.S. nuclear electricity generation capacity is ~100 GWe with a 92% capacity factor, requiring greater than 17,000 MT/yr of uranium.
To feed the continuous recycle fuel cycle system, only ~ 1 MT of fertile material (depleted uranium or natural uranium) is required per year per gigawatt capacity. In the continuous recycle fuel cycle, the used fuel is recycled with only a small amount of material (the fission products and possibly the minor actinides) becoming waste for eventual geologic disposal and a small amount of makeup fertile material being added. With continuous recycle, less than100 MT/yr of fertile material would be needed to support current levels of U.S. nuclear electricity generation. The U.S. currently has ~ 700,000 MT of depleted uranium in storage [NRC, 2015] that could be used as makeup material. Once this runs out, natural uranium could be used.
5.3. Continuous recycle fissile material inventory
To establish the fuel cycle system, an inventory of fissile material must be collected and maintained that includes both the fissile material in the reactor core and the fissile material that is outside the reactor in the recycle loop [Feng, 2016a]. When starting up a new reactor, this is the material needed for the initial full core fuel load and all of the partial core reloads until the first batch of discharged fuel can complete the recycle loop and be placed back in the reactor.
The amount and composition of the continuous recycle fuel cycle inventory was found to depend on a number of factors, including:
•
The amount of fuel required to start up or operate a given reactor capacity is based on the specific power density of the reactor design, which is the thermal power of the reactor per unit of fuel material. Fast reactors in general are able to achieve higher power densities than thermal reactors because of the better heat transfer properties of non-water coolants such as liquid sodium. In addition, fast reactors with break-even breeding ratios typically operate at higher specific power densities compared to fast reactors with higher breeding ratios because the large mass of fertile blankets in higher breeders are factored into the fuel requirements.
•
Higher burnup fuel reduces annual refueling requirements, reducing the amount of fuel in the recycle loop and associated fuel recycling costs. Burnup is a measure of how much of the initial fuel material is consumed (fissioned) while in the reactor, expressed in terms of energy released per unit of initial fuel material mass (GWd/t).
•
Fuel cooling time prior to recycling are assessed to require 5 years if it is being shipped to a centralized recycling facility, but can be as short as 1 year if the fuel is recycled on site depending on the recycling technology. These times are consistent with those assumed in the 2014 Evaluation and Screening study [FCRD, 2014]. When nuclear fuel is discharged from a reactor, it initially produces a lot of heat due to radioactive decay of short-lived fission products and must be stored for a period of time before it can be disposed or recycled. Efficient transportation of this fuel is based on full shipping casks (limited primarily by weight or volume). However, excessive decay heat and hydrogen production due to high radioactive decay levels can prevent full shipment payloads if the fuel is not sufficiently cooled. The processing rate of aqueous used fuel separations technologies may also be limited if the fuel is not sufficiently cooled. Electrochemical separations technologies are designed to operate at higher temperatures [Willit, 1992] and are assumed to be able to reprocess fuel with shorter cooling times.
•
The fuel recycling process was estimated to average 2 years for centralized recycling and 1 year for recycling on site. This estimate includes time for shipping the used fuel, separating the fission products from the reusable materials, fabricating the fresh fuel, shipping the fresh fuel, and waiting for the next time the reactor is shut down for refueling.
For the transition studies, multiple reactor and fuel designs were considered to minimize the fuel material inventory, with the best results per gigawatt capacity requiring ~ 50 MT of total material including 6.7 MT of plutonium for the breakeven system and ~ 140 MT of total material including 9.4 MT of plutonium for the breeder/burner system.
The amount of fissile material needed for transition can be reduced by initially building only fast breeder reactors. This allows the initial fast reactors to produce the plutonium they need for refueling as well as some additional plutonium that can be used to help start up the later reactors. Once all of the fissile material needed has been obtained, the breeding rate can be reduced for the breakeven system. For the breeder/burner system, the breeding rate is maintained and the excess plutonium is used to transition the fuel in the remaining current thermal reactors to use bred 239Pu instead of mined and enriched 235U. Note that this approach only works in zero or low growth scenarios, where significant savings were observed [Passerini et al., 2015, Feng et al., 2017].
5.4. Fissile material inventory impacts on growth
The greater the amount of fissile material required per reactor, the lower the sustainable growth rate. Each new reactor must have enough material for the initial core and for refueling until the first discharged fuel has been fully recycled and becomes available.
During transition, growth is limited by the rate at which external fissile material can be acquired. Fissile material obtained through recycle of thermal reactor used fuel is limited by the inventory of cooled used fuel available and the separations capacity. Fissile material obtained via mining of uranium is relatively unlimited. These two sources are discussed in the next section.
After transition, faster growth requires increasing the breeding ratio of fast reactors in the breakeven system or increasing the ratio of fast to thermal reactors in the breed/burn system. Both approaches increase the total system breeding ratio, increasing fissile production. The sustainable growth rate of the established continuous recycle fuel cycle is a function of the core inventory, net fissile production rate, and the recycle time. There is a theoretical limit on the ratio of the production rate and the core loading which lead to an upper bound on the sustainable growth rate of roughly 1.5% with the 7-year recycle loop (1 GWe per year for each 67 GWe). On-site recycle requires less inventory and therefore increases the sustainable growth rate. Faster growth requires an external source of fissile material.
<Section>6. Start-up material findings</Section>
There are three main impediments to implementing a closed fuel cycle. The first is obtaining sufficient fuel material for starting the fast reactors and the second is maturing the technologies required, both of which are discussed in this section. The third is to accomplish the industrial scale deployment necessary to establish the required infrastructure, some aspects of which are discussed here and some discussed in the next section.
6.1. Recycling thermal reactor used fuel to provide the Start-up fissile inventory
This study found that transition can be achieved in the U.S. via thermal reactor used fuel in zero or low growth scenarios.
To obtain enough material to start one gigawatt of breakeven fast reactors requires separating over 500 MT of thermal reactor used fuel while the breeder/burner system would require nearly 800 MT. The traditional source for plutonium for fast reactor start-up identified in past studies is to separate it from thermal reactor used fuel [INFCE, 1980, NASAP, 1980]. With current burnup levels of ~50 GWd/t, fresh thermal reactor fuel enrichment starts at ~4.2% fissile 235U. As the 235U is consumed, some plutonium is also being bred. As the fuel approaches the targeted burnup, some of the 239Pu is also being consumed, extending the fuel life. At discharge, the fuel is down to 0.8% 235U, but also contains 1.2% plutonium, or ~12 kg/MT.
The rate of transition is limited by the thermal reactor used fuel separations capacity. This is due to the large amount of used fuel that must be separated to start each fast reactor.
The U.S. does not have any large scale fuel separation facilities. France and Russia currently have operating facilities and Japan has a new facility expected to become operational in 2022. Fuel separation facilities are large facilities with specialized equipment and can take a decade or more to permit and construct.
It may be more cost effective to utilize only recently produced thermal reactor used fuel for transition:
•
The current ~100 GW U.S. fleet discharges ~1,800 MT of fuel annually. Depending on the transition rate desired, the associated separations capacity constructed and the time for construction, there could be enough of this higher burnup fuel to support transition without needing to separate any of the older fuel.
•
The U.S. has a large inventory (~85,000 MT) of existing discharged thermal reactor fuel. Much of it is older fuel with lower burnup and therefore a lower amount of plutonium per MT, so while the inventory is sufficient, more of the older fuel would need to be separated and therefore costs would be higher with the lower burnup fuel. Current plans are for geologic disposal of this existing fuel.
•
The older existing fuel could be recycled after transition, if desired for the waste benefit. This would likely involve a cost/benefit analysis based on the cost of geologic disposal versus the cost of recycling. Any excess plutonium obtained could be consumed in the fast reactors by reducing their breeding rate.
•
Recycling of older fuel may be required to support growth during transition, depending on the length of transition and the growth rate.
On the negative side, the transition studies also revealed the system is tightly coupled and any delay in one part of the system delays the whole system. This could result in missing the window for changing the fuel cycle as part of replacement of existing reactors as they retire. Any delays could also trigger cost and schedule overruns in the individual construction projects and the prospect of completed reactors not having sufficient fuel for operation.
•
If using thermal reactor used fuel for transition, the technologies for fast reactors, separating thermal reactor used fuel, fabricating fast reactor fuel containing plutonium, and separating fast reactor used fuel must all be available around the same time. These technologies are not currently available on an industrial scale and any delay in maturing any of these technologies delays transition.
•
A substantial upfront capital investment is required for separations, as a large capacity facility can cost $10–20B. A large amount of used thermal fuel separation capacity must become operational before transition can begin.
•
The fast reactor used fuel must be recycled as soon as possible or the total amount of material needed increases significantly. Every year added to the recycle loop increases plutonium needs from the thermal reactor used fuel by ~10%, adding to the amount of thermal fuel separation capacity required.
•
The initial recycling facilities for fast reactor fuel must either be small or must run at well below capacity. During initial transition, there are only a few fast reactors producing used fuel, Small facilities are not as economical as larger facilities and running any facility well below capacity is also non-economical. Fig. 6 illustrates this issue in a 1% growth scenario where a new separations facility must be added as soon as demand exceeds the capacity of the existing facility. The constraint of needing to recycle this fuel as soon as possible prevents building up a stockpile of used fuel until there is enough to keep a larger recycling facility fully utilized. Slow introduction of fast reactors due to limited thermal reactor separation capacity worsens this constraint.
Fig. 6. Large separation facility utilization during transition with immediate separations (1% growth).
•
Temporary stoppage of recycling of fast or thermal used fuel during transition can result in insufficient fuel for the fast reactors unless an inventory of separated material is developed sufficient to last through the stoppage9. Storage of prefabricated fuel containing plutonium is constrained to only a few years because a secondary fissile material in plutonium, 241Pu, decays and reduces the fuel fissile content.
6.2. Using enriched uranium to provide the Start-up fissile inventory
Given the constraints associated with obtaining plutonium from thermal reactor used fuel, an alternative source for fuel material was identified and found to potentially advantageous compared to start-up using plutonium by significantly reducing technical risks and the potential for associated cost and schedule overruns while also improving transition economics (discussed in the next section).
This study found that transition can also be achieved via high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) which is uranium enriched to more than 5% but less than 20%. A number of fast test reactors have been operated over the last 50 years using enriched uranium. Fast reactors require much higher enrichments than the 3–5% used for thermal reactors due to the lower fission cross sections at fast neutron energies, so higher fissile concentrations are needed to keep fast reactors critical. Calculations performed on several designs within this study confirmed that fast reactors can be started on HALEU with maximum enrichment levels under 20% and enough fissile content in the used fuel to initiate continuous recycling [Feng et al., 2017, Hoffman, 2016b, Hiruta, 2019].
The use of HALEU to start up fast reactors was found to decouple much of the system and alleviate or completely eliminate most of the transition constraints:
•
Recycling of thermal reactor used fuel becomes optional. If still desired for the waste management benefits, recycling thermal reactor used fuel can be delayed and no longer constrains transition. From an economics perspective, this also reduces the cost, as the net present value of the investment is reduced significantly when a major investment is pushed back by decades10.
•
The fast reactor used fuel no longer needs to be recycled as soon as possible. The fast reactor can continue to be operated on HALEU fuel indefinitely, but there is a cost; HALEU fuel does require more natural uranium per unit energy produced than thermal reactor fuel and produces more depleted uranium. The need for additional natural uranium ends as soon as recycled fuel becomes available.
•
When using HALEU, the only new technology required to start transition is fast reactors. Enrichment and uranium fuel fabrication are already established technologies. If used fuel separations technologies and technologies for fabrication of fuels containing plutonium are delayed, the fast reactors can continue to operate on HALEU fuel.
•
Used HALEU fuel can be stored until a sufficient stockpile exists to support a large separation facility, improving recycling economics.
•
Once recycling of the used HALEU fuel begins, the recovered material has sufficient fissile material to continue to fuel the fast reactors without additional mining and enrichment. With designs developed in this study, the first pass used fuel has significant amounts of residual fissile uranium along with ~ 3% bred plutonium. During subsequent recycling passes the fissile uranium continues to decrease while the plutonium increases for the next 3–4 recycling passes. Eventually, an equilibrium is reached in which the residual 235U levels in uranium reach steady-state (less than1%) and the fissile content is virtually all from plutonium
•
Fresh HALEU fuel has a long shelf life compared to Pu-based fuels, allowing prefabrication and storage of contingency fuel to protect against any disruptions in the rest of the fuel cycle. Calculations indicated HALEU can be used for fuel reloads at any time, even after the reactor has reached equilibrium. The primary fissile isotope, 235U, has an extremely long half-life and no poisons are generated through radioactive decay. This is in contrast to plutonium-based fuels in which the fissile 241Pu decays with a 14.4 year half-life into fertile 241Am.
<Section>7. Transition economics findings</Section>
7.1. Reactor costs
On a lifecycle basis, analyses show reactor costs account for ~85% of the total cost of the system, with fuel costs and associated facilities accounting for the other 15%.
All current reactors will eventually need to be replaced. Whether the new reactors are thermal reactors or fast reactors does not significantly change the system cost, as fast reactors are projected to have similar costs as replacement thermal reactors. However, there is more uncertainty associated with the fast reactor costs because a large fleet of fast reactors has never been built.
The initial cost of operations for fast reactors is expected to be more expensive until some experience is developed. As experience is gained, the percent time the reactors are down for maintenance is expected to decline, leading to higher capacity factors11. This was the case for the current fleet of thermal reactors as well, where initially reactors were only operating ~50–60% of the time, but the capacity factor improved with experience and has been averaging ~90% for the last 20 years. (This is well above the capacity factors for all other major types of electricity generation).
7.2. Radioactivity drives fuel cycle facility costs
Although fuel cycle facility costs on a per-unit of electricity basis are small compared to reactor costs, a single fuel cycle facility typically supports many reactors and can be a large investment itself.
Nuclear facilities are designed to protect workers and the public from radiation hazards, including the use of shielding to block the radiation. How hazardous a radioactive material is and the approach needed for handling it safely depends on how fast it decays and the type of radiation it emits:
•
Contact handled - Natural uranium and thorium decay extremely slowly12, emit alpha particles, and are only mildly radioactive, so facilities using these natural materials require only minimum controls to limit inhalation or ingestion (which are the primary health hazards). Specifically, workers can handle solid uranium and thorium without radiation shielding. This allows most work on the front end of the once-through fuel cycle to be “contact handled” without special enclosures or shielding.
•
Glove box - Plutonium with high fissile content is only slightly more radioactive, but is also very toxic. Any work with plutonium requires that the material is physically separated from workers to prevent inhalation of any airborne particles. This work is conducted in hermetically sealed chambers called gloveboxes.
•
Hot cell - Most fission products are highly unstable and decay quickly, making them highly radioactive. Some also emit gamma radiation, requiring separations and waste packaging work to be performed in shielded enclosures called hot cells using remote manipulators. Used fuel and high level waste containing fission products are always keep shielded, including during storage and transport. Hot cells are unique to nuclear work and are very expensive facilities.
One driver of fuel cycle facility costs will be the level of radioactivity in recycled fuel materials, especially for fuel fabrication. Whether this material can be fabricated into fuel in a glove box or will require more expensive hot cells depends on the isotopic content of the plutonium, whether minor actinides are recycled, and the efficiency of used fuel separations if minor actinides are not separated.
•
Fuel made from plutonium with a high percentage of fissile isotopes can be fabricated in glove boxes, while lower quality plutonium will require hot cell fabrication to reduce worker dose. The most common fertile isotope of plutonium, 240Pu, has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate, emitting neutrons that increase worker dose if not shielded. In the cases analyzed, this was found to mainly be a problem in the fast breeder/ thermal burner option, where the thermal reactor burns out the fissile material. The lowest plutonium fissile content occurred when thermal reactor used fuel was recycled continuously back into the thermal reactor and only make-up plutonium came from the fast reactor.
•
Fuel materials containing even small amounts of minor actinides will require hot cells for fabrication. This can occur either if minor actinides are recycled by design, or if minor actinides are to be disposed but the separation from the uranium/plutonium product is not very clean. Aqueous separations technologies have been developed to produce high efficiency separations of minor actinides from plutonium and uranium. Electrochemical technologies are being developed for minor actinide recycling and at their current level of development are not able to achieve clean separations if the minor actinides are instead to be disposed.
7.3. HALEU Start-up reduces transition costs
Start-up of fast reactors with HALEU was found to have lower transition costs than start-up with plutonium through avoidance of the need for some facilities, reduced costs in some required facilities, and the potential to improve economies of scale without reducing facility utilization factors:
•
The expense of construction and operation of LWR used fuel separations is avoided. As mentioned in the previous section, LWR fuels can still be separated if desired for waste benefits, but as a separate activity after transition has been achieved.
•
The expense of remote fabrication of fast reactor fuels is delayed. Start-up cores and initial reloads of fast reactors would use HALEU fuels, which can be fabricated without expensive gloveboxes or hot cells.
•
Fast reactor used fuel separations and remote fabrication facility unit costs can be reduced. The need to immediately recycle fast reactor fuels to reduce total fuel material needs (Section 5.3) is alleviated because production of HALEU is relatively unconstrained. This allows for storage of used fuel until there are sufficient inventories to support full utilization of larger, more economical facilities (compare Fig. 7 to Fig. 6). When these larger facilities begin operation, in turn there will be a larger, sustained amount of recycle material to support full utilization of larger remote fuel fabrication facilities Fig. 8.

<Section>8. Minor actinide recycling</Section>
Fundamentally, the minor actinide issue is a trade-off between reducing the cost of recycling versus reducing the cost of high level waste disposal. Two out of the four most promising fuel cycles identified in the Evaluation and Screening study included minor actinide recycling and two did not.
•
If minor actinides are recycled, recycled fast reactor fuel will require remote fabrication in hot cells and fresh fuel must be shielded during transportation and handling. If used fuel is recycled in centralized facilities, cooling time for used fuel prior to shipping may also increase, adding to the fissile material inventory requirements. However, recycling will allow these materials to be consumed in the fast reactors, rather than ending up in the waste streams, potentially reducing disposal costs.
•
If minor actinides are not recycled, it may increase high level waste disposal costs. Because many minor actinides have half-lives measured in hundreds or thousands of years, they extend the amount of time when high level radioactive waste remains hazardous and the geologic repository must contain these wastes. The longer this time period, the greater the uncertainty of containment by the geology alone and the more likely that expensive engineered barriers will need to be added. The size of a repository may also need to be increased because waste packages will give off more decay heat and may need to be spaced further apart. However, disposal of minor actinides simplifies the handling of the material being recycled, including less costly glovebox fabrication of fuel and minimal shielding requirements for fresh fuel.
Minor actinides should only be recycled in fast reactors. The primary purpose of recycling minor actinides is to destroy them. In thermal reactors, minor actinides and fertile plutonium isotopes are more likely to capture absorbed neutrons than to fission, resulting in a low net destruction rate. In fast reactors, the fission per absorption rate is higher for all elements heavier than uranium, increasing the rate of minor actinide destruction while also decreasing the rate of new minor actinide creation from plutonium, see Fig. 7. When recycling minor actinides in the fast breeder/thermal burner system, the minor actinides recovered the used fuel of both reactor types should only be included in the fresh fast reactor fuel. This either requires technology for separating the minor actinides from uranium and plutonium that is to be recycled back into the thermal reactors or recycling all thermal reactor fuel back into the fast reactors.
While the transition studies identify several issues associated with both disposal and recycling of minor actinides, the best approach remains unclear. Additional technology development is required to recycle minor actinides and construction of the repository is still years away, so there is time to gather additional information. Transition to a continuous recycle fuel cycle can proceed without a decision on this issue, as recycling of minor actinides can be added to the system later, however any used fuel separation that occurs prior to adding minor actinide recycling will result in waste that contains minor actinides that would be impractical to retrieve later for recycling.
<Section>9. Conclusions</Section>
The current once-through nuclear fuel cycle in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world was a direct result of commercialization of water-cooled thermal spectrum reactor technologies developed for nuclear propulsion of submarines. This fuel cycle has safely and reliably produced carbon-free energy for more than 60 years. However, studies have consistently shown that a continuous recycle fuel cycle should be much more efficient, theoretically reducing uranium usage by ~99% and high level waste production by ~95%.
The continuous recycle fuel cycle requires fast spectrum reactors to breed fissile fuel material from fertile material, so implementation would require a fleet of new reactors. Most of the current thermal reactors in the U.S. were built around the same time in the 1970s and 1980s and are anticipated to need replacement in the next 20–40 years. This presents a unique opportunity to transition to a continuous recycle fuel cycle by replacing some or all of the retiring reactors with fast reactors and initiating used fuel recycling.
This paper has highlighted the results of a series of studies focused on transitioning the nuclear infrastructure from the current fuel cycle to continuous recycle. Major findings include:
•
Assuming the continued use of nuclear power in the U.S., transition to a closed fuel cycle based on continuous recycle is feasible to achieve during the time period when the current fleet of reactors need replacement. The continuous recycle fuel cycle includes breeding of fissile material in fast reactors instead of obtaining it from mining uranium.
•
The transition requires development of a significant inventory of fissile material to initially fuel the reactors. Once recycle is established, the ongoing resource requirements would be less than 1% of current requirements and high level waste mass would be only ~5% of current generation for the same level of energy production.
•
Two methods for producing the fissile material inventory are from recycle of the used fuel from current thermal reactors or the use of High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). The recycle of thermal reactor used fuel is the traditional approach and used fuel separations facilities are currently operating in France and Russia. However, this study found that the use of HALEU may be more favorable because it is less constrained and may be more economical. The benefits of start-up on HALEU include:
Fewer technologies required to initiate transition
Major investments in fuel separation facilities can be delayed
Fuel fabrication costs during initial transition will be lower
The system would be more robust and better able to handle disruptions in the recycle system without impacting reactor fuel availability
9.1. Ongoing work
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Nuclear Energy Office has completed an assessment of the full range of potential nuclear fuel cycles [FCRD, 2014] with the primary finding that a continuous recycle system based on natural uranium feed and fast reactors for fissile production is the most promising for major improvements to the fuel cycle. It has also completed studies on how to transition from the current nuclear infrastructure to that needed for the new fuel cycle once all required technologies are matured (summarized in this paper).
Studies are now focusing on identifying the current technology maturity levels of these technologies and the research and development activities needed to bring the technologies to the level necessary for constructing demonstration facilities, if desired, using the Technology Readiness Assessment process [DOE, 2011]. All of these activities support the Office of Nuclear Energy in planning and managing the Nuclear Technology Research and Development program. They could also provide technical information to support an informed decision if policy makers desire to consider changing the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle.
