Abstract
Mass attenuation coefficients for molecular precipitates have been measured and compared to results using the EGS5 Monte Carlo computer code and results from an empirical formula. This study assesses the mass attenuation coefficients of isotopes that can be readily produced by thermal neutron activation of elements in a reactor and precipitated in molecular compounds. Good agreement exists between measured results and EGS5 simulated results. Results are within reasonable agreement with the empirical mass attenuation formula. These results are further compared to simulated fission product isotopes. This study suggests mass attenuation coefficients of molecular precipitates can be approximated using EGS5, especially in the instance of radioisotopes produced predominantly through uranium fission.

1. Introduction
The radiochemical study of fission product isotopes is often conducted with gas proportional counters. Procedures for preparation of these samples are found in literature (Kleinberg, 1990, Lindner, 1965, Hyde, 1951). Typically, in the final steps of sample preparation, precipitates are either vacuum filtered or electrodeposited onto planchets. The filter paper or planchet is then mounted onto a sample holder and positioned near the detector for counting. When preparing replicate samples of the same fission product isotope after irradiation, the initial samples will have the same specific activity. However, due to slight differences in chemistry and losses in preparation, the final samples will vary in thickness.
The molecule containing the radioactive isotope or the matrix into which it is precipitated can absorb a part of the beta radiation. This effect is known as self-absorption. A correction for the variation in self-absorption due to the sample thickness of the emitted beta radiation must be applied to accurately determine the activity of the sample. In most beta emitters, the self-absorption is significant even in thin layers due to the inactive matrix (Konya and Kónya, 2012).
The total intensity of the radiation reaching the surface of the sample is given by (Konya and Kónya, 2012, Massini, 1961)
@(1)
where I is the intensity, I0 is the surface density intensity, µ is the mass attenuation coefficient, and x is the areal thickness. Several authors have given the empirical formulae for the mass attenuation coefficients or have calculated the mass attenuation coefficients through various theories (Evans, 1955, Baltakments, 1970, Burek and Chocyk, 1996, Gürler and Yalçın, 2005). These formulas are approximations since the absorption depends on the distribution of the beta energy (Yi et al., 1999) as well as the geometry of the detector (Baltakments, 1970). In the literature, many reported values exist for mass attenuation coefficient of metal absorbers (e.g. Al, Pb, Cu, and Zn), but few exist for organic compounds or oxides (Pujol and Suarez-Navarro, 2004). Therefore it is necessary to prepare samples of varying thickness to determine the mass attenuation coefficient for a given detection system and fit the values to Eq. (1).
This method works well for activation products such as 99Mo, which can be easily produced by thermal neutrons in a reactor by the activation of 98Mo (i.e. 98Mo(n, γ)99Mo). The viability of 99Mo production is driven by the high natural abundance and large thermal cross section of 98Mo. This technique has been used to estimate efficiency curves for gas proportional counters (Bayhurst and Prestwood, 1959). Other fission products, such as 97Zr, are not easily activated in a thermal reactor without isotopic enrichment (Keim, 1952). Difficulties associated with sufficient production of fission product isotopes in research reactors limits the ability to complete a direct, experimental assessment of mass attenuation coefficients for these isotopes.
To overcome these limitations, this study assesses the mass attenuation coefficients of fission product isotopes that can be readily produced by the thermal neutron activation of elements in a reactor. These results are then compared to simulated values calculated from a multipurpose Monte Carlo program, EGS5. EGS5 is then used to calculate the mass attenuation coefficients of additional fission product isotopes not readily produced by thermal neutron activation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Gas proportional counting system
The detector and lead housing were supplied by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The body of the gas proportional detector is machined from a solid piece of 6061 aluminum tubing. One end is fitted with a four-hole flange HN female connector with solder cup terminal. Two 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) posts are soldered to the terminal. The collecting electrode loop is 0.05 mm (0.002 in.) diameter stainless steel wire soldered to the posts. The opposite end of the body is counter sunk and covered with a 0.01 cm thick DURAL window held in place by a metal ring. The window diameter is 25 mm. The body of the detector is held in alignment to the slide holder by two 3.18 mm (1/8 in.) steel dowels in each end. The slide holder accommodates 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) thick 6061 aluminum plates measuring 6.35×8.26 cm (2.5×3.25 in.). The detector is housed inside a 6.35 cm (2.5 in.) thick lead cave which removes nearly all detectable background radiation. A diagram of the gas proportional detector is shown in Fig. 1. An Ortec 571 amplifier supplies power to an Ortec 109PC preamplifier. Detector bias is supplied by and Ortec 456 high voltage power supply. Tail pulses from the preamplifier are directly routed into an Ortec 406 A single channel analyzer with a lower level discriminator (LLD) of 0.02 V. Logic pulses are counted by an Ortec 919 ADCAM Multichannel buffer which is connected to computer by an ORTEC Dual-Port Memory to USB Converter. The beta plateau varies 2% over 1800–2000 V and operating voltage was determined to be 1900 V. P-10 was used as the gas for the ionization chamber at atmospheric pressure with a flow rate of 50 cc/min CO2.

2.2. Source preparation
Standardized solutions were prepared and subsequently irradiated in the Geological Survey TRIGA Reactor (GSTR), a 1 MW low-enriched uranium-fueled, pool-type reactor located at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, CO (Koehl et al., 2015). These solutions were then divided to provide samples of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg of the element of interest and precipitated. Precipitates were vacuum filtered onto 24 mm, Grade 42, ashless quantitati​ve filter paper from GE Healthcare. The filtration chimney was made from polyether ether ketone (PEEK) with an inside diameter of 19 mm. Precipitate thickness was measured with a micrometer. Calculated average precipitate densities are shown in Table 1. The filter paper with precipitate was mounted on a 1.6 mm thick (14 gauge) 6061 aluminum plate with double sided scotch tape and covered with 3.5 µm thick Mylar film. The density of the filter and double sided tape was averaged from replicate measurement of the thickness and mass.

Silver and cadmium were electroplated onto stainless steel planchettes. Disposable electrodeposition cells were constructed from 20 cm3 polyethylene liquid scintillation vials similar to other publications (Lee and Lee, 2000, Talvitie, 1972). The inside diameter of the vials at the neck was 15.4 mm. The anodes were platinum wire loops and the cathodes were 26 gauge type 304 stainless steel planchets laser cut to 3/4 in. diameter.
2.3. Gas proportional counter efficiency
After irradiation, and counting on the gas proportional counter, the induced gamma activities emitted from the samples were counted on a Canberra reverse electrode closed ended coaxial high purity germanium (HPGe) detector (model number GR1320) coupled with an EG&G Ortec ADC Spectrum Master 92X multichannel analyzer. A certified NIST traceable Spectrum Techniques 152Eu source with an uncertainty of ±5%, and a NIST traceable Eckert & Ziegler mixed gamma source was used to determine the efficiency at various distances from the HPGe detector. The total activity of the sample was subsequently calculated and the efficiency of the gas proportional counter determined.
2.4. EGS5 Monte Carlo simulation
The Electron Gamma Shower (EGS) code is a general purpose Monte Carlo program for the simulation of electron and photon transport (Hirayama H et al., 2006). The current version written in FORTRAN is EGS5. Arbitrary geometries can be created and verified with the particle trajectory and geometry display program, CGView (Takamuraa et al., 2004). Energy deposited in the P-10 gas is tallied and counted to determine the efficiency of the simulation. Beta spectrum are derived from International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication (ICRP) 107 (Eckerman and Endo, 2008). The BinBeta module, written by KF Eckerman from the Radiological Toolbox software developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was used to produce a beta spectrum Monte Carlo input file for EGS5 with 50 energy bins (Eckerman and Sjoreen, 2013). In the EGS5 simulation, the composition of the precipitates was calculated by determining the fraction of air within each precipitate using Eqs. (2) and (3).

where xppt is the volume fraction of the precipitate, xair is the volume fraction of air, ρmeasured is the average measured precipitate density in Table 1, ρair is the density of air in Lakewood, Colorado which is taken to be 0.96×10−3 g/cm3, ρppt is the density of the compound. Since electronic noise is present in the counting system, a lower level discriminator (LLD) is applied to filter out the noise. Pulses from the preamplifier due to the energy deposition of charged particles in the detector volume that are below 0.02 V are not counted. To simulate this effect in EGS5, deposited energy in the sensitive area of the detector below 5.1 keV is not counted. This cut off was determined from minimizing the root mean square error of the calculated and measured efficiencies. All simulations were run on a Pentium based laptop running Cygwin with 106 particles.
2.5. Empirical mass attenuation formula
The mass attenuation coefficient of an element is related to the end-point energy of the beta spectrum as in

where C1 and C2 are constants. For a wide range of materials, Thümmel consolidated absorption curves over a wide range of maximum beta energies and proposed the following formula (Thümmel, 1974)

where Z is the atomic number, A is the atomic weight, and Em is the maximum end point energy of beta particles in MeV. This formula is used to validate both the experimental values and the EGS5 simulated values. The mass attenuation coefficient for any chemical compound or mixture of elements is given by Bragg's Additivity rule

where wi and µi are the weight fraction and mass attenuation coefficient of the ith constituent element, respectively. For a chemical compound, the fraction by weight is given by

where Ai is the atomic weight of the ith element and ai is the number of formula units.
3. Results
3.1. Detector response at high count rates
Measurement of a sample of known radioactive decay, a special case of the method of proportional sources, was used to determine the measured detector response at high count rates (Kohman, 1949). To measure this response, a KClO4 samples containing approximately 10 µCi of 42K were prepared. These samples were counted every five minutes for approximately ten half-lives. The decay of 42K was followed until the activity reached a level at which the half-life of 13.4 h was observed and the resolution losses were negligible (Steinberg, 1961). This occurred after approximately 2.5 days. The deviation of the initial portion of the decay curve at high count rates to that of the expected count rate is given by Eq. (8) (Kohman, 1949)
@(8)
where R is the recorded count rate, N is the true count rate, and τ is the resolving time. Data in which the half-life of 13.4 h was observed was used to create the true count rate, N. The true count rate and recorded count rate of the samples were fitted to Eq. (8) which yields a resolving time of 168.1±0.5 µsec. The true count rate vs the recorded count rate is plotted on the dashed line in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2. Comparison of EGS5 calculated detector response vs measured detector response. Calculated count rates from EGS5 simulations are plotted vs the measured count rate of various isotopes and Eq. (8) is used to determine a calculated resolving time. The measurement of a sample of known radioactive decay (42K) is used to determine the measured detector response.
EGS5 was used to determine the simulated true count rate for all experimental samples. This simulated count rate was plotted vs the measured count rate and is shown in Fig. 2. A resolving time of 181.6±0.6 µsec is found when the simulated count rate and measured count rate are fitted to Eq. (8) as shown in the solid line in Fig. 2.
3.2. Mass attenuation coefficients
Experimental data was fitted to Eq. (1) using least square analysis to determine mass attenuation coefficients. EGS5 simulations determined the detector efficiency at various sample thicknesses. Count rates were then calculated assuming a specific activity for all samples. Eq. (5) was used in conjunction with Eqs. (6) and (7) to determine the empirical mass attenuation of the compound. Table 2 provides a consolidated list mass attenuation coefficients for these measurements and calculations.

Fig. 3 is a plot of the EGS5 calculated efficiencies of various fission product nuclides verses areal thicknesses. In general, the detector efficiency increases with increase in average beta energy from 112Pd, 136Cs, 137Cs, 147Nd, and 97Zr. Since cadmium and silver are electroplated in thin deposits on planchettes rather than precipitated and vacuum filtered, the efficiency of those two elements is greater.

4. Discussion
4.1. Detector resolution
The EGS5 calculated resolving time is greater than the measured resolving time. This is an important and statistically significant deviation at very high count rates. Comparing the results of calculated true count rates using the EGS5 calculated resolving time to the measured resolving time using the relationship in Eq. (8) at count rates less than 650 cps results in a variance of less than 1%. Additionally, the propagated difference of the calculated mass attenuation coefficients, using Eq. (1), is less than 1.5% at the count rates below 650 cps. Therefore, experimental data less than 650 cps was used to determine mass attenuation coefficients and the measured resolving time of 168±1 µsec was used for efficiency and mass attenuation calculations.
4.2. Mass attenuation coefficients
Measured mass attenuation coefficients of 110Ag, 95Zr, 134Cs, 153Sm, 109Pd, 99Mo, and 42K are in agreement with EGS5 simulation results. This suggests that there is no statistical difference between the measured attenuation coefficients and results obtained through a Monte Carlo simulation.
Measured attenuation coefficients and EGS5 simulated results are in general agreement with mass attenuation coefficients calculated from the empirical formula in Eq. (5). In cases where both measured and simulated results are higher than the empirical formula (110Ag, 109Pd, and 99Mo), this is likely due to backscatter caused by the geometry of the sample holder and detector.
The EGS5 calculated mass attenuation coefficient for 112Pd is much lower than the calculated coefficient from Eq. (5). This may be due to the contribution from two effects. First, the low density of the measured Pd(C4H7N2O2)2 precipitate allows for a greater range of beta particles within the precipitate. Additionally, the cut-off energy or the minimum beta energy needed to produce a count in the detector is approximately 100 keV (Bayhurst and Prestwood, 1959). While this reduces the efficiency, this effect also increases the average beta energy from 112Pd that reaches the sensitive area of the detector. The empirical formula only considers the beta particle end point energy. 112Pd has the lowest end point energy in this experiment and may indicate a lower bound on the ability of the empirical formula to predict the mass attenuation coefficient in organic ligands. Further experiments are required to support this suggestion.
The 137Cs mass attenuation coefficient from Eq. (5) is more than half of the EGS5 result. Since the shape of the 137Cs beta spectrum has a large tail at high energies, the maximum beta energy is 1175.63 keV while the average beta energy is 187.1 keV, Eq. (5) does not accurately represent the mass attenuation of 137Cs. The EGS5 calculated results for 137Cs however agree with other results: 28.4–51.8 (Baltakments, 1970), 31.0±0.5 (Baltakmens, 1977), 36.4±1.7 (Pujol and Suarez-Navarro, 2004), and 27.33 (Švec, 2015).
There are essentially two methods to determine the mass attenuation coefficient of beta particles: transmission experiments and experiments with constant specific activity as discussed in this paper. In transmission experiments with an incident beam of beta particles, an absorber is placed between the source and detector. The beta particles are attenuated through the absorber in a relationship that is closely represented by Beer's law and the mass attenuation for the absorber is determined. This relationship is only an approximation since beta particles interact with matter differently than electromagnetic waves, have a continuous energy spectrum, and the scattering and backscattering of beta particles changes the energy spectrum and its angular distribution (Massini, 1961). Nevertheless, resulting empirical relationship for the mass attenuation is given in the form of Eq. (4) and are accurate for a given experimental setup and compounds. Additionally, the results of experiments using external absorbers to determine the mass attenuation coefficients in compounds have been demonstrated to be different than the mass attenuation coefficients determined by preparing a number of weighted standards of the same specific activity (Pujol and Suarez-Navarro, 2004). This effect is more noticeable with beta spectrum of lower average energy (Pujol and Suarez-Navarro, 2004). Therefore for isotopes that emit beta spectrum of low average energy, it is more accurate to prepare various weighted standards or alternately determine the mass attenuation coefficient through a Monte Carlo code.
5. Conclusions
The mass attenuation coefficients of neutron activated isotopes were compared to a Monte Carlo simulation for a wide range of compounds. These coefficients agreed with each other but varied from a calculation based on empirical data. While it is important to directly measure the detector efficiency and mass attenuation curves for a given detector configuration, this manuscript shows that a Monte Carlo simulation can be used to calculate mass attenuation coefficients of isotopes that are not easily produced through activation of thermal neutrons.
