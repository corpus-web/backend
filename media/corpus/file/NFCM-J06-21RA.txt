Abstract
In order to improve the utilization rate of hydroxyl group as the key ingredient for titanium hydroxide (TH) applying to the adsorption of U(VI) from aqueous solution, mesoporous silica microspheres supported titanium hydroxide (TH/SiO2) have been synthesized, which have characteristics of high specific surface area and easy separation compared to TH. The maximum adsorption capacity of 219 mg g−1 on TH/SiO2 which can be converted to 1086 mg g−1 on TH was achieved. The adsorption mechanism of U(VI) adsorbed on TH/SiO2 was mainly dominated by inner-sphere surface complexation.
Introduction
The recovery of uranium from wastewater is very important in view of natural resource shortage and environmental pollution. Among the various methods for the separation and preconcentration of radioactive metals from wastewater, adsorption is an important technique owing to its economical, cost-effective and simple features in removing trace levels of ions [1,2,3]. Numerous adsorbents have been explored in the past decades including polymers [4, 5], magnetic materials [6], porous materials [5, 7], resin [8], metal–organic frameworks [9], iron nanoparticles [10] and so on. The metal hydroxides, such as ferrihydrite [11], goethite (α-FeOOH) [12], Al-hydroxide [13], zirconium hydroxide [14], are attractive candidates for use as sorbents for U(VI) removal and recovery due to their high surface areas, low-cost and their affinity to several soluble metals [15, 16]. The surface complexation model was used to describe the adsorption process of U(VI) on metal hydroxides [11,12,13,14]. It was suggested that surface hydroxyl groups play a key role for the adsorption of U(VI) [14].
It was reported that titanium(IV) hydroxide (TH) was effective for extraction of U(VI) from sea water [17, 18]. However, TH powdered particles are difficult to separate and recycle from the wastewater. Recently, there is a growing interest in the synthesis and application of novel adsorbents by loading the hydroxide on another solid [16, 19, 20]. Eladb et al. reported that Ni(OH)2 or Co(OH)2 loaded on amberlite IR120 adsorbent could be used effectively for U(VI) removal from aqueous solutions [16]. By using a three-dimensional layered double hydroxide/graphene hybrid material, the adsorption capacity of U(VI) was enhanced due to its large specific surface area and typical mesoporous characteristics [19]. Mesoporous silica microspheres was known very well to have many characteristics, including high specific surface area, inexpensive and easily available, good physical strength, uniform pore size distribution, and more importantly ease of recovery [21,22,23,24,25]. It is reasonable to expect that an efficient adsorbent for U(VI) with high adsorption performance and easy seperation can be obtained using mesoporous silica microspheres as carrier. Thus, the mesoporous silica microspheres supported TH hybrid material (TH/SiO2) are synthesized and investigated as an adsorbent for U(VI) removal from aqueous solutions in this paper.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
Silica microspheres (100–200 mesh, BET 355 m2 g−1, pore volume 0.99 mL g−1) were purchased from Qingdao Baisha River Catalyst Factory. Analytical grade of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O) was purchased from HuBei Chushengwei Chemistry Co., Ltd. The rest of the reagents used in the study were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and were also analytical purity. U(VI) stock solution (4.0 mmol L−1, pH 1.0) was prepared by dissolving accurately weighed amount of UO2(NO3)2·6H2O in 0.1 mol L−1 nitric acid.
Preparation of TH/SiO2
In a typical process for the preparation of 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2, 10.0 g of silica microspheres was added into round-bottom flask prior to the addition of 10 mL of 1.0 mol L−1 TiCl4 solution and 15 mL of dichloromethane. After continually stirring for 30 min, the mixed solution was heated using rotary evaporator at 313 K for 30 min so to completely remove the dichloromethane. 53.5 mL of diluted NH4OH solutions containing 3.5 mL 25 wt% ammonia were added dropwise into the above mixture under stirring for 40 min. After being aged overnight at room temperature, the resultant solid was separated by filtering, simultaneously washed with warm water for several times until no chloride ion was found in the filtrate, and dried at 378 K for 3 h. The preparation of TH/SiO2 containing various loading amounts of TH (2.9 wt%, 5.8 wt%, 8.7 wt%, 14.5 wt%) were the same as above. Different raw materials dosages in the preparation of TH/SiO2 were listed in Table S1.
For the preparation of TH, 35.0 mL of 1.0 mol L−1 titanium tetrachloride solution was directly neutralized by dropwisely adding ammonia solution (12.0 mL 25 wt% ammonia diluted with 50 mL water) under stirring. The subsequent processing steps were the same as those for the preparation of TH/SiO2. It should be noted that it took about 1 day to filter and wash the solid in the preparation of TH, which was 8–10 times more than that in the preparation of TH/SiO2.
Characterization of TH/SiO2
The specific surface area of SiO2, TH and TH/SiO2 were determined by N2-BET method at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) by a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument. In order to acquire the value of size distributions and the pore volumes, Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model were applied for analyzing the desorption data of N2 isotherm. The morphology of the samples was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Spectrum GX FT-IR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) with samples as KBr pellets in the 4000–400 cm−1 region. The zeta potential of TH/SiO2 was examined using a Zeta Potential Analytical Instrument (Malvern ZS90).
Batch adsorption experiments
The adsorption experiments were carried out by batch technique in a conical flask. Typically, 0.01 g of TH/SiO2 was added to 20.0 mL U(VI) solution consisting of 5.0 mL of 4.0 mmol L−1 U(VI) stock solution, 2.0 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 KNO3 solution, a certain amount of 0.1 mol L−1 KOH or 0.1 mol L−1 HNO3 solutions which adjusted the initial pH, and distilled water. The resultant solution were slowly stirred for 60 min at 303 K and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min (or at 3500 rpm for 60 min for TH) at room temperature. The concentration of U(VI) was determined by the Arsenazo III spectrophotometric technique at a wavelength of 652 nm [26, 27]. The adsorption capacity of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 (qe, mg g−1) and the adsorption rate (R) can be calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2):
qe=(C0−Ce)Vm
(1)
R=C0−CeC0×100%
(2)
where C0 and Ce (mol L−1) are the concentrations of U(VI) in the initial and equilibrium solutions, respectively; V (L) is the volume of the testing solution and m (g) is the weight of adsorbent.
Desorption and reusability studies from 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2
Seven sets of parallel adsorption experiments were performed, which 20.0 mL of 1.0 mmol L−1 U(VI) solution was mixed with 0.01 g 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 at pH 5.0 for 60 min. Then the TH/SiO2 was separated and the supernatant was subjected to U(VI) measurements. The resultant U-loaded adsorbent was washed several times with about 5 mL of distilled water. After that, 2.0 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 KNO3 solution, 0.1 mol L−1 HNO3 or 0.1 mol L−1 KOH to adjust pH to 1.0–7.0 and some distilled water was added to ensure total volume reaching up to 20.0 mL. Subsequently, desorption was carried out at 303 K for 120 min. After the best desorption solution pH was selected, the adsorption/desorption of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 were performed in four consecutive cycles. The desorption rate (R′) can be calculated using Eq. (3).
R′=qdesqads×100%

where qads and qdes (mg g−1) are the amounts of U(VI) adsorption and desorption.
Results and discussion
Effect of loading amounts of TH on TH/SiO2
The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of silica microspheres, TH and TH/SiO2 were listed in Table 1. Compared with silica microspheres, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of various amounts TH loaded adsorbents did not change significantly. Combined with SEM and TEM images of SiO2 and TH/SiO2 shown in Fig. 1, it was inferred that pore structure of SiO2 was not altered and TH was uniformly dispersed on the surface of SiO2. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S1(a), features of the adsorption–desorption isotherms for SiO2 and TH/SiO2 were hysteresis loop, suggesting that both SiO2 and TH/SiO2 were mesoporous in character, and there is monolayer coverage [28, 29]. The calculated average mesoporous diameter by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method was about 83.5–86.9 Å and mesoporous distribution was in a wide range [Fig. S1(b)]. However, the specific surface area and pore volume of pure TH were much lower than that of SiO2 and TH/SiO2.

The effect of different loaded amounts of TH on TH/SiO2 on U(VI) adsorption was shown in Table 1. SiO2 possessing fewer hydroxyl groups had poor adsorption performance. A large quantity of hydroxyl groups on the surface of TH gathered with each other, resulting in that TH had small specific surface area, a small amount of hydroxyl groups were exposed on the surface of TH, and utilization rate of hydroxyl groups was extremely low. This was the reason why pure TH served as adsorbent had lower adsorption capacity. When TH/SiO2 was used as the adsorbent, the converted adsorption amount [qc, calculated from Eq. (4)] was 4–8 times larger than the adsorption capacity (qe) of TH alone. The reason was that a great quantity of hydroxyl groups of TH was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TH/SiO2 with high specific surface area so as to greatly enhance the utilization rate of hydroxyl groups.
qc=qe,TH/SiO2−qe,SiO2Rwt%
(4)
where qc (mg UO2 g−1) is the converted adsorption capacity of pure TH, qe,TH/SiO2 and qe,SiO2 (mg UO2 g−1) are the adsorption capacity of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 and SiO2, Rwt% is the weight percentage of TH on SiO2.
It is observed from Table 1 that U(VI) adsorption capacity (qe) grew with increasing loading amount of TH on TH/SiO2 in general. The maximum adsorption capacity (qe) of TH/SiO2 is 219 mg g−1 corresponding to the converted adsorption amount (qc) 1086 mg g−1, which can be obtained by using 0.01 g of 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2. Obviously, qe (201 mg g−1) on TH is much lower than qc on 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2. Thus, 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 adsorbent sample is selected for the further U(VI) adsorption studies on the basis of maximum adsorption capacity of U(VI).
The FT-IR spectra of TH, SiO2, 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 before and after U(VI) adsorption and uranyl nitrate were shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with Fig. 2b, the broad band in the range of 3100–3500 cm−1 and the peak at 1630 cm−1 in Fig. 2c are strengthened owing to the existence of OH group which is from TH, indicating that TH has loaded on SiO2. Moreover, three characteristic peaks at 1080, 805, 467 cm−1 belonging to SiO2 also appear in Fig. 2c, suggesting that the structure of SiO2 is not altered after TH loaded on SiO2. It is inferred that U(VI) has been adsorbed to the surface of TH/SiO2 due to the appearance of two distinct new peaks at 907 and 1385 cm−1 assigned to UO2 group in Fig. 4d, and the weakening of the band in the range of 3100–3500 cm−1 and the peak at 1630 cm−1 attributed to OH group demonstrates that the OH group is involved in the adsorption process of U(VI).

Figure 3 showed the spherical surface morphology of SiO2, 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 before and after adsorption of U(VI). The external surface of SiO2 (Fig. 3a) was relatively smooth and neat. TH/SiO2 microsphere showed slightly rough surface as observed in Fig. 3b. As shown in Fig. 3c, the surface of TH/SiO2 after adsorption of U(VI) became uneven and lumpy, indicating that the surface of TH/SiO2 microsphere was covered by the adsorbed U(VI).

Effect of pH and ionic strength
According to the literature [30,31,32], uranyl ions would be precipitated in the form of UO2(OH)2 at pH value higher than 5.1 if uranyl ions concentration exceeded 1.0 mmol L−1. The effect of initial pH values of aqueous solution ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 on adsorption behavior of TH/SiO2 for U(VI) was investigated. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4a that the adsorption capacities of TH/SiO2 for U(VI) were low at pH 2.0–3.0, indicating that there was the competitive adsorption on the surface of TH/SiO2 between H3O+ and UO22+ at low pH, and the existence of repulsive force limited the approach of UO22+. After that, the qe increased dramatically with the increase of pH from 3.0 to 5.0 and reached the highest at pH 5.0. As shown in Fig. 4b, the negative charges on adsorbent surfaces increased with the decreasing concentration of H+ so that UO22+ were more easily adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent. This was the reason why the adsorption capacities increased with the increase of pH [33,34,35].

Also, it can be seen from Fig. 4a that the influence of various ionic strength of KNO3 on U(VI) adsorption was weak and negligible. The adsorption process was intensely dependent on pH and independent on ionic strength, suggesting that the adsorption mechanism of U(VI) adsorbed on TH/SiO2 was mainly dominated by inner-sphere surface complexation [36,37,38,39].
Effect of time and adsorption kinetic model
To interpret the mechanism of adsorption processes of U(VI) on TH/SiO2, adsorption kinetics and the influence of contact time as an important parameters of kinetics were researched. It was evident from Fig. 5a that the adsorption capacity of U(VI) enhanced quickly during the first 20 min owing to abundant active sites existed in the surface of TH/SiO2 and the small mass transfer resistance. Subsequently, the free sites had gradually been occupied by UO22+ and the adsorption capacity increased slowly. The adsorption efficiency reached the dynamic equilibrium at about 60 min.

The kinetics of U(VI) adsorption on 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 were analyzed using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order model which were calculated by the following Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively [40, 41].
log(qe−qt)=logqe−k12.303×t
(5)
tqt=1k2q2e+tqe
(6)
where qe and qt (mg g−1) are the amount of U(VI) adsorbed at equilibrium state and time t (min), respectively. k1 (min−1) and k2 (g mg−1 min−1) are rate constants of the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order adsorption, respectively.
The linear plots of log(qe − qt) versus t and t/qt versus t were displayed in Fig. 5b, c, and the values of qe, k1, k2, and correlation coefficient R2 are given in Table S2, respectively. The R2 of pseudo-second-order model was 0.995 and the calculated adsorption capacity qe,cal was closer to the experimental adsorption capacity qe,exp, indicating that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was more suitable to describe the adsorption process of U(VI). It can be suggested that the chemisorption is the rate-controlling step [30, 42].
Effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics
The effect of temperature on adsorption was examined with the range of 298–333 K. As shown in Fig. 6, the value of qe abruptly increases from 298 to 303 K. The increasing rate of qe value became steadily and slowly when the temperature was higher than 303 K. The crucial parameters of thermodynamics including ΔHo (standard enthalpy change), ΔSo (standard entropy change) and ΔGo (standard Gibbs free energy change) in U(VI) adsorption process calculated by the following Eqs. (7–9) were given in Table 2 [19].

Table 2 Thermodynamic parameters for U(VI) adsorption on 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2
The positive value of ΔHo suggests that the adsorption of U(VI) is an endothermic process. The positive value of ΔSo indicates the increase randomness at solid/liquid interface in the process of U(VI) adsorption [19, 43]. ΔGo value is negative and decreases with increase in temperature, proving more efficient adsorption at higher temperature and the spontaneity of the adsorption process [44].
Effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherm models
The Fig. 7a revealed the effect of initial concentration of U(VI) on adsorption. The adsorption capacity of U(VI) was obviously increased with increasing initial concentration of U(VI) with the range of 0–1.0 mmol L−1 at pH 5. The reasons may be that increasing initial concentration of U(VI) provides a significant driving force to conquer the mass transfer resistance between solid phase and aqueous phase, which enhanced the adsorption process [45, 46]. In order to further understand the adsorption behavior of TH/SiO2, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models (Fig. 7b, c) are used to describe adsorption equilibrium [30,31,32]. The two model equations can be expressed as Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively.
Ceqe=1q0KL+Ceq0
(10)
logqe=logKF+1nlogCe
(11)
where q0 (mg g−1) is the maximum adsorption capacity at complete monolayer coverge and KL (L mg−1) and KF are the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption coefficient.

The calculated values of isotherm parameters are shown in Table S3. The adsorption of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 shows strong correlation (R2 > 0.99) with both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model. The possible reason is that a minor part of U(VI) can also be adsorbed on the supporter SiO2, as well as the adsorption process of U(VI) on TH and SiO2 in the adsorbent TH/SiO2 is different. Thus, both the monolayer and multilayer adsorption existed in the adsorption process of U(VI) on TH/SiO2. The values of n (1.53–1.87) for the Freundlich model are more than 1.0, indicating that the adsorption of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 is a favorable process over the entire temperature and concentration range.
Effect of competitive ions
Competitive ions are also an important factor for the adsorption of U(VI) in aqueous solutions because the cations can compete for the active sites on adsorbent surfaces. Since high Ca2+, Mg2+ concentrations were usually present in wastewater, Mg(NO3)2 and Ca(NO3)2 were selected to investigate the effect of competitive ions to evaluate the adsorption selectivity of 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2. As shown in Fig. 8, an excellent tolerance of 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 in a range of concentrations (1.0–5.0 mmol L−1) of Ca2+ and Mg2+ can be observed, which indicated the desirable selectivity of 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 for UO22+ against Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.

Desorption and reusability study
The repeated availability is also very important for the practical application when evaluating the economy and applicability of adsorbents. In this work, the desorption experiments of U(VI) were performed with various pH solutions in the range from 1.0 to 7.0. As shown in Table S4, the desorption experiments were conducted at pH 1.0, at which about 93% of U(VI) can be desorbed. Furthermore, the results of reusability experiments were presented in Fig. S2, indicating that 11.6 wt% TH/SiO2 had good adsorption capacity and reusability.
Adsorption mechanism
The synthesis procedure of TH/SiO2 and the speculated adsorption mechanism of U(VI) were shown in Scheme 1. There were two main types of surface sites, namely isolated silanol (an OH group bonded to one Si atom) and geminal silanol (two OH groups bonded to a Si atom) on the surface of silica, respectively [47, 48]. Two surface sites acted as a key role for TiCl4 loading on the surface of SiO2. Here we took isolated silanol for instance to illustrate the synthetic mechanism of TH/SiO2 in Scheme 1. TiCl4 can be adsorbed intensely on the surface of SiO2, and then one chlorine atom of TiCl4 was easily substituted by the OH group of silanol to form Ti–O bond. After that, the addition of ammonia solution produced plenty of OH groups and made TH load on the surface of supporter to form TH/SiO2. U(VI) was adsorbed on TH/SiO2 through inner-sphere surface complexation. UO22+ was linear with two axial oxygen atoms, and that the coordination of UO22+ with other ligands were probably occured in the equatorial plane [49]. A bidentate chelation bond was formed by O atoms in two OH groups connected with Ti bound to a uranium center [50]. TH have been well dispersed on the surface of SiO2 (Fig. 1) and have high specific surface area, so sufficient OH groups could be utilized to its fullest. This was the reason why the converted adsorption capacity (qc) of TH/SiO2 for U(VI) was higher than the adsorption capacity (qe) of pure TH.

Conclusion
In this study, TH/SiO2 were prepared and used for adsorption of U(VI). Compared with SiO2, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of TH/SiO2 did not varied markedly, indicating that pore structure of SiO2 was not altered and TH was uniformly dispersed on the surface of SiO2 so as to greatly enhance the utilization rate of surface hydroxyl groups of TH after TH loaded on SiO2. The maximum adsorption capacity of 219 mg g−1 on TH/SiO2 which can be converted to 1086 mg g−1 on TH was obviously higher than the adsorption capacity (201 mg g−1) on pure TH. The kinetic model of U(VI) adsorption could be described by the pseudo-second-order model well. The isothermal model was fitted to both the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The hybrid TH/SiO2 material can be easily separated from the aqueous solution, and still had high adsorption capacity after 4 times cycles. TH/SiO2 adsorbent exhibited excellent selectivity and good affinity to U(VI) in the presence of competitive ions (Ca2+, Mg2+). The adsorption process of U(VI) on TH/SiO2 was achieved by inner-sphere surface complexation. The interaction between the hydroxyl groups and U(VI) played an important role. This work offers a promising adsorbent TH/SiO2 for cost-effective and high-efficient treatment of radioactive wastes.
