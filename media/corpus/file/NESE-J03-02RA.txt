<Section>Abstract</Section>
Water is used as a cooling fluid of certain systems in operational fusion reactors and will also be used in the ITER tokamak. During cooling the water is exposed to high energy neutrons emitted from fusion of deuterium and tritium and becomes activated. The main contributors to the activity of the cooling water are radioactive isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen produced by activation of oxygen isotopes in the cooling water, i.e. 16N, 17N and 19O. As currently few experiments for water activation in fusion reactors exist, computational methods are needed to determine water activation and consequent dose rates in fusion reactors. The calculated activation of oxygen isotopes strongly depends on the cross sections in evaluated nuclear data libraries. For fusion reactors there are two reference nuclear data libraries: FENDL-2.1 and FENFL-3.1b. The calculated activities of nuclides in water have an uncertainty, which depend on the uncertainty of calculated neutron spectra and uncertainty in reaction cross sections. For the reference fusion libraries the uncertainty for activation of water isotopes, due to uncertainty in reaction cross section, is around 8% for isotope 16O, around 12% for the isotope 17O and around 12% for isotope 18O. The uncertainty in oxygen activation due to the uncertainty of activation cross sections is thus in the order of several percent. Hence statistical uncertainty of neutron fluxes calculated with the Monte Carlo method can be of the same order of magnitude.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Water is used as a cooling fluid of certain systems in operational fusion reactors, such as JET [1] and WEST [2], and will also be used in tokamak ITER [3] for cooling of the vacuum vessel and auxiliary systems such as radio frequency heating. When flowing through components the cooling water is exposed to high energy neutrons (14 MeV) emitted from fusion of deuterium and tritium (DT) and gets activated. The activated water flows through the primary cooling circuit, commonly outside the primary biological shielding, where it decays, emitting radiation, which causes radiation damage to electrical components, increasing doses to personnel working around the cooling circuit and nuclear heating of various cold components such as superconducting coils cooled by liquid helium [4]. Activation of water consist of activation of oxygen and hydrogen as primary constituents of the H2O molecule, activation of dissolved gasses, corrosion products and additions to water. As all the latter are case specific and the major contributors to the total water activity during operation are the activated oxygen nuclides this paper will focus on activation of only these isotopes [5].
The main contributors to the activity of pure cooling water are radioactive isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen produced by activation of oxygen isotopes in the cooling water, i.e. 16N, 17N and 19O [5]. Few experiments of water activation at fusion conditions have been performed in the past with the use of DT generators [6], [7]. Due to this computational methods are needed to extrapolate water activation to conditions in fusion reactors. As the calculated activation of oxygen isotopes strongly depends on the choice of evaluated nuclear data libraries, several up to date nuclear data libraries are analysed and used for calculations of water activation with taking uncertainties in the cross sections into account as these are rarely analysed. Calculated results of cooling water activation in fusion reactors are compared to calculated results for fission reactor as activation of water, radiation and nuclear heating due to activated water decay in fission reactors can be used for extrapolation to conditions in fusion reactors.
The analysis presented in this paper is performed with the Monte Carlo particle transport code MCNP [8] for calculation of neutron spectra and RR_UNC code [9] for calculations of average cross sections with uncertainties due to cross section uncertainties. In the first part of the paper the neutron activation data and neutron spectra in fusion and fission reactors are presented. The second part of the paper presents the results of isotope activation for all important water activation reactions and comparison of results between fission and fusion reactors.
<Section>2. Neutron activation of water</Section>
Activated isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen in cooling water are produced from activation of oxygen isotopes via the 16O(n,p)16N, 17O(n,p)17N and 18O(n,)19O reactions. 16N and 19O are gamma emitters (6 MeV for 16N and 0.2 for 19O) while 17N decays by neutron emission (1 MeV). Summarized data with the dominant energies of decay products are presented in Table 1.
Table 1. Summarized data of activated isotopes of cooling water and dominant energies of decay products modified from [5].
1.36 MeV (33%)
Reactions 16O(n,p)16N and 17O(n,p)17N are threshold reactions with thresholds at 10.2 MeV and 8.4 MeV respectively while the reaction 18O(n,)19O can already take place at thermal neutron energies. Cross sections taken from the fusion evaluated nuclear data library (FENDL-3.1b [10]) for all three water activation reactions are presented in Fig. 1. As there are many different evaluated cross sections for the above mentioned water activation reactions in different evaluated nuclear data libraries, the cross sections can be significantly different. In this paper cross sections from seven different libraries were used: FENDL-2.1 [11] and FENDL-3.1b [10] as the reference fusion evaluated nuclear data libraries, ENDF/B-VII.1 [12], ENDF/B-VIII.0 [13], JEFF-3.3 [14] and JENDL-4.0u [15] as representative for evaluated nuclear data libraries commonly used for computations in fission reactors and TENDL-2017 [16] as the computed nuclear data library occasionally used as a reference for cross section in above mentioned nuclear data libraries.

In fusion reactors fusing deuterium and tritium the energies of neutrons at birth are around 14.1 MeV. As currently no fusion reactors are fusing deuterium and tritium, experiments in fission reactors for water activation are used for extrapolation to conditions in fusion reactors. The experimental results are compared to calculations for development of methods which can be further used for fusion reactors. The neutron spectrum between fission and fusion reactors differ and the comparison of both neutron spectra in cooling water, normalized to total neutron flux of 1, is presented in Fig. 2. Due to the differences in the neutron spectra between fusion and fission reactors and due to the shapes of the cross sections for water activation the water activation will be higher in fusion reactors [5].

In this paper the analysis of water activation calculation with taking the reaction cross section uncertainties into account is performed with the RR_UNC code [9]. MCNP [8] was used to calculate neutron spectra in the first wall cooling system for fusion reactors and in the reactor core in a fission reactor. The neutron spectra and cross sections in ENDF-6 format were used as an input for the code RR_UNC for calculation average cross section:
@(1)
In this way the differences in average cross sections are only due to difference in shape of neutron spectra and not due to differences in neutron flux intensities. Due to this the units of average cross sections are millibarn.
The calculated uncertainty of the average cross section is made out of two parts, one due to uncertainty in the neutron spectra and one due to uncertainty of cross section. The uncertainty due to cross section is calculated from the covariance matrix in the nuclear data library while the uncertainty due to neutron spectra is computed from the provided uncertainty of spectra.
<Section>3. 16O(n,p)16N reaction</Section>
The cross section for activation of the isotope 16O in FENDL-2.1, FENDL-3.1b, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.3 and TENDL-2017 are based on the ENDF/B-VI and the same experimental data from [17]. In the ENDF/B-VIII.0 new evaluation up to 7 MeV was performed, thus the cross section for the water activation reaction did not change compared to the ENDF/B-VII.1 library. From the studied nuclear data libraries only in JENDL-4.0u the cross section for activation of 16O differs compared to other nuclear data libraries. Due to this only cross sections form ENDF/B-VIII.0 and JENDL-4.0u are presented in Fig. 3. In addition the uncertainty in the cross section and experimental data performed in different years is also presented [18]. The peak in cross section at around 11.75 MeV is smaller in JENDL-4.0u library compared to other libraries but the cross section better fits the experimental data.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
The calculated average cross sections and uncertainty for activation of isotope 16O are presented in Table 2. From the results it is visible that in fusion reactors the activation of isotope 16O is higher by more than two orders of magnitude compared to fission reactors. This is due to the shape on neutron spectra as there is high neutron flux above reaction threshold in fusion reactors compared to neutron spectra tail in fission reactors. Despite the difference in cross section between JENDL-4.0u and other libraries the calculated average cross section for fusion reactors are similar.
Table 2. Calculated average cross sections for activation of isotope 16O in fusion and fission reactor.
With the RR_UNC code the uncertainty of the calculated average cross sections due to uncertainties in cross sections was also obtained and is presented in Table 2. The contribution of MCNP uncertainty to the total uncertainty of results was minimized and was below 0.5% for all nuclear data libraries. The major contribution to the total uncertainty of calculated results is thus due to uncertainty in the reaction cross section which is around 7.5% for JENDL-4.0u library and 8% for all other studied nuclear data libraries.
<Section>4. O(n,p)N reaction</Section>
FENDL-2.1 and JENDL-4.0u libraries do not contain cross sections for the O(n,p)N reaction. ENDF/B-VII.1 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 libraries have the same cross sections while the FENDL-3.1b and JEFF-3.3 use cross sections from older TENDL libraries. Due to this the cross section for O activation differs between libraries as presented in Fig. 4. The cross section in JEFF-3.3 library is taken from TENDL-2015 and cross section in FENDL-3.1b is taken from TENDL-2010, which are predecessors of TENDL-2017 library. Evaluated cross sections in TENDL libraries are based on computations by software for simulation of nuclear reactions TALYS [16]. The TENDL-2010 library is based on TALYS 1.20, TENDL-2015 is based on TALYS 1.74 and TENDL-2017 is based on the TALYS 1.9 for computation of cross sections. Due to this the cross sections between this three libraries are similar unlike the cross section from ENDF/B-VII.1 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 library, which are taken from ENDF/B-V library which was released in 1978 and is based on computations by MODNEW [19] and measurements performed by Menlove [20] and do not have uncertainties for the reaction cross sections.

The colored regions around cross sections represents the uncertainties and the changes of uncertainty value is due to energy group structure of the cross section. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Results for average cross section calculations for activation of O are presented in Table 3. Due to higher cross section for reaction in ENDF/B-VII.1 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 library the calculated average cross sections are higher compared to other analysed libraries. Comparison of the calculated average cross section between fusion and fission neutron spectra shows higher activation in fusion reactors due to higher neutron fluxes in the region over reaction threshold compared to fission neutron spectra.
Table 3. Calculated average cross sections for activation of isotope 17O in fusion and fission reactors. The results from the both ENDF/B libraries are italicized as there are no uncertainties of reaction cross sections.
As already stated ENDF/B-VII.1 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 libraries do not have uncertainties of the reaction cross section as there is no covariance matrix. Due to this the uncertainty presented in Table 3 is only due to uncertainties in the calculated neutron spectra. For fusion reactors the uncertainty of average cross sections calculated with the FENDL-3.1b library is around 12% while for JEFF-3.3 and TENDL-2017 libraries the uncertainty is around 54%. This is due to higher uncertainties of reaction cross section in the region around 14 MeV energy which was increased with the TENDL-2012 library. However, even when taking into account the uncertainty of the reaction cross section the calculated average cross sections are lower than average cross sections calculated with both ENDF/B libraries.
<Section>5. 18O(n,)19O reaction</Section>
As in the case of activation of isotope 17O, the FENDL-2.1 and JENDL-4.0u libraries do not have the cross section for the reaction 18O(n,)19O. The ENDF/B-VII.1 library also lacks the cross section for this reaction. With the release of the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library the cross section for activation of 18O was added. The cross section is based on the Moghabghab resonance parameters below 5 MeV [21] while above 5 MeV the cross section is based on Kopecky and Nierop evaluation for EAF-3 library. The cross section in the FENDL-3.1b library is taken from the TENDL-2014 while the cross section in the JEFF-3.3 library is taken from the TENDL-2015 library. The TENDL-2014 library is based on TALYS 1.64 version and TENDL-2015 is based on TALYS 1.74 version. The cross section for activation of 18O taken from the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library differs significantly compared to cross sections in other studied nuclear data libraries. The cross sections for reaction 18O(n,)19O in all studied nuclear data libraries are presented in Fig. 5. The difference in cross sections is in the epithermal neutron energy region as in this region the cross section for 18O(n,)19O from other libraries exhibit a resonance peak, while the cross section from ENDF/B-VIII.0 library has no peak. The difference is also in the fast neutron energy region above 2 MeV where the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library has a constant reaction cross section. The ENDF/B-VIII.0 library lacks uncertainty of the reaction cross section as there is no covariance matrix.

The colored regions around cross sections represents the uncertainties and the changes of uncertainty value is due to energy group structure of the cross section. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Unlike previous two studied water activation reactions the cross section for activation of 18O has no threshold and can be already activated with thermal neutrons. The results of average cross section calculations are presented in Table 4. The comparison of the calculated average cross sections between fusion and fission reactor spectra show almost the same reactions rates except for the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library. This is due to constants and high cross section above 2 MeV compared to other nuclear data libraries. For fission reactors the difference in calculated neutron spectra is not visible between all studied libraries as the neutron fluxes in high energy region are small compared to neutron fluxes in fusion spectra. The calculated average cross sections between FENDL-3.1b, JEFF-3.3 and TENDL-2017 are equal due to the same cross sections.
Table 4. Calculated average cross sections for activation of isotope 18O in fusion and fission reactors for all studied nuclear data libraries. The results from the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library is italicized as there is no uncertainty of reaction cross section.
The uncertainty in calculated average cross sections with the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library are only due to uncertainty in the calculated neutron spectra with MCNP as the reaction cross section does not have an associated uncertainty. The uncertainties of calculated average cross sections for FENDL-3.1b, JEFF-3.3 and TENDL-2017 for fusion spectra are between 10% and 12%. For fission spectra the uncertainties are lower and are around 2% (except TENDL-2017) due to a higher contribution of the thermal part of the neutron spectra to the calculated average cross section. For the calculated average cross sections with TENDL-2017 library and fission spectra the uncertainty of results in around 9%. This is due to change in the uncertainty of the reaction cross section. Previous versions of TENDL library had no uncertainty in the thermal region while in the TENDL-2017 the uncertainty of the reaction cross section is around 8%.
<Section>6. Conclusion</Section>
The calculated activation of oxygen isotopes strongly depends on the cross sections in evaluated nuclear data libraries in which the cross sections can be significantly different. For fusion reactors there are two reference nuclear data libraries: FENDL-2.1 and FENFL-3.1b. The calculated results for activated isotopes of water have an uncertainty, which depends on the uncertainty of calculated neutron spectra and uncertainty of reaction cross sections. For the reference fusion libraries the uncertainty for activation of water isotopes, due to uncertainty of reaction cross sections, is around 8% for the isotope 16O, around 12% for the isotope 17O and around 12% for the isotope 18O. For some cases this uncertainties are similar to results obtained with other nuclear data libraries such as JEFF-3.3 and TENDL-2017 but can significantly differ for other cases (activation of isotope 17O and 18O with ENDF/B-VIII.0 library).
The comparison of calculated average cross sections for fusion and fission reactors show higher activation of isotopes 16O and 17O in fusion reactors due to the higher neutron fluxes above the threshold energy for reactions. For the isotope 18O the calculated average cross sections are similar for both types of reactors as the reaction has no threshold energy and can be achieved already by thermal neutrons. It should be noted that the results for average cross sections with the use of ENDF/B-VIII.0 library produce similar results to other nuclear data libraries with fission spectra but there is a significant difference for fusion neutron spectra due to a higher cross section above 2 MeV compared to other libraries.
The results presented in this paper show that statistical uncertainty of neutron fluxes calculated with the Monte Carlo method can be of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty due to uncertainty of reaction cross section.
