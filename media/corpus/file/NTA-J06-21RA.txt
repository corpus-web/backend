The operating characteristics of hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition for hydrogen pro- duction were investigated using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code, and various factors, such as hydrogen production, heat of reaction, and temperature distribu- tion, were studied to compare device performance with that expected for device devel- opment. Hydrogen production increased with an increase of the surface-to-volume (STV) ratio. With an increase of hydrogen production, the reaction heat increased. The internal pressure and velocity of the HI decomposer were estimated through pressure drop and reducing velocity from the preheating zone. The mass of H2O was independent of the STV ratio, whereas that of HI decreased with increasing STV ratio.

1.Introduction
Hydrogen not only has potential for use as an alternative to fossil fuels, but also plays a key role in solving what is known as  a  trilemma  (economic  growth,  energy  use,  and  environ- mental degradation) [1]. A number of thermochemical cycles were first postulated by Funk and Reinstrom [2] as the most efficient way to produce fuels (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia) from stable and abundant species (e.g., water, nitrogen) using heat sources.

In a closed cycle system, various related processes have been proposed and have received a great deal of attention. The sulfureiodine (SI) process involving thermochemical hydrogen production using nuclear energy was proposed by General Atomics and this technology has been studied by many researchers [3e5].
Extensive research on hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition for hydrogen production has been carried out for experimental verification and measurement of several factors, such as con- version efficiency and kinetics [6]. The decomposition of HI is the key to producing hydrogen in the SI cycle. The decompo- sition of HI in the absence of any catalysts is not efficient even at 773.15 K; therefore, catalysts have been used to promote this reaction [7]. Moreover, the rate of the homogeneous gas-phase reaction is considerably low at temperatures <700 K. Thus, it is desirable to use a catalyst to increase the reaction rate, which has led to the study of platinum catalysts [8e10]. A decompo- sition test using 98% pure HI gas was carried out by Ilda [8] in 1978 using a platinum supported on polytetrafluoroethylene catalyst. Moreover, Wang et al. [11] investigated the effects of different supports (carbon nanotubes, active carbon, carbon molecular sieve, graphite, and Al2O3), masses of catalyst, and reaction temperatures on the decomposition of HI. Fresh and used active carbon-supported platinum catalysts were also characterized. Furthermore, different types of catalysts including noble metals and support materials (active carbon [7,12], Pt [13], Ni [14], and bimetallic catalysts [6]) have been reported to catalyze HI decomposition.
To date, much progress has been made on the efficiency of this process. However, insufficient research has been con- ducted on the role of water vapor in the HI decomposition process. In addition, very few reports have been published on the kinetic studies of HI decomposition in the presence of H2O. Assessment of the real potential of the HI decomposition re- action requires a deep knowledge of the thermodynamic behavior of hydrogen production systems. Improving the ef- ficiency of hydrogen production and optimizing the reactor requires an understanding of the thermodynamics of the process. The thermodynamic model for the HIx system used by Roth and Knoche was proposed by Neumann [15] in 1987, and was based mostly on total pressure measurements per- formed   at   Rheinisch-Westfa€lische   Technische   Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen [16] and on liquideliquid equilibrium data. In
the simulation studies, hydrogen pressures higher than those expected for homogeneous gas-phase HI decomposition in the direct  decomposition of  HIeH2OeI2  solution were achieved
[17].  Berndha€user  et  al.  [18]  compared  the  calculated  homo-
geneous gas-phase reaction results with those of direct HI decomposition from HIeH2OeI2 solutions, and found that the rate of direct HI decomposition was several orders of magni- tude higher than that of the gas-phase reaction. Furthermore,
Lanchi et al. [19], Murphy and O'Connell [20], and Hadj-Kali et al. [21], reviewed the phase equilibrium properties of the HIeI2eH2O (HIx) system and proposed new thermodynamic models for describing the thermodynamic properties of this system. Many researchers have attempted to develop appro- priate models for the HI decomposition reaction in the SI process [22,23]. Commercial process simulators such as Aspen Plus (Aspen Technology, Inc., Massachusetts, USA) [24e26] and ESP (simulator program, Microsoft, USA) [27e29] have been used to develop these thermodynamic models.
In addition, in recent years, interest in and research on nu- clear hydrogen technology, which involves direct decomposi- tion of water to produce a large amount of hydrogen at high temperatures in a nuclear reactor as the heat source of the thermochemical cycle, has increased [30,31]. In particular, following the successful continuous operation of a bench-scale closed cycle gas turbine by the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency, SI thermochemical hydrogen production technology has taken center stage as one of the high-practical-potential hydrogen production technologies that could be coupled with the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) [32e36]. However, trans- ferring the high heat output of the gas coolant for VHTR to the SI thermochemical cycle involves the great challenge of devel- oping a heat-exchanger material capable of withstanding high temperatures (1173 K) and pressures (approximately 50e70 kg/ cm2). In the HI decomposition reaction, which requires a lot of heat in the SI cycle, if the decomposition efficiency of HI can be maintained at high pressures, the design and development of the heat exchanger and reactor can be flexible.
In this study, an optimum decomposition reactor in the thermochemical VHTReSI cycle operating characteristics of the HI decomposition reaction were investigated using the code. Several factors, such as hydrogen production, heat of the reaction, and temperature distribution, were studied to compare the device performance with that expected for de- vice development.

2.2.Model design
The reactive distillation flow sheet developed by GA Company (General Atomics, San Diego, CA, USA) [38] is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A illustrates the HI decomposition section. The dashed line in Fig. 1B shows the multistage distillation column for the periodic acid solution and the HI decomposer.
The HIeI2eH2O mixture gas was discharged from the condenser part of the multistage distillation column for the HI reaction, and flowed into the HI decomposer. Then, the H2eI2 gas was generated after decomposition of the mixture gas. In
this study, the characteristics of the thermal decomposition device (HI decomposer, Fig. 2A) were investigated using the
CFD simulator model (Fig. 2B).
Fig. 2A shows the HI decomposer model and the heating device consisting of a sealed three-stage electric heater. A Hastelloy  HC276 tube  was  inserted, and  its outer diameter,
inner  diameter,  and  height  were  60.5  mm,  52.7  mm,  and 1500 mm, respectively. This tube was filled with active carbon catalyst and Al2O3 Raschig ring. Each of the three electric heaters had built-in heating elements (i.e., 3.65-kW Kanthal A-
1) and the HC276 tube was surrounded by a low-density ceramic fiber board for insulation. Moreover, a proportional- integral-derivative controller was used to maintain the tem- perature of the three electric heaters at a set value. The HIeI2eH2O mixture gas discharged from the condenser of the multistage distillation flowed into the bottom of the inlet of the HI decomposer at an absolute pressure of 5 kgf/cm2 (506,625 Pa). The temperature gradually increased to reach the set temperature of the electric heater of the HI decomposer and was maintained at this value. Meanwhile, helium (He) gas or N2 gas was supplied to the HI decomposer to maintain the

pressure at 506,625 Pa, and thermal equilibrium was achieved using an external heating chamber of the HI decomposer. The mixture gas was supplied to the inlet under the conditions that the temperature reached the set point and the pressure was reliably maintained at 5 kgf/cm2.
2.3.CFD analysis methods and boundary conditions of the CFD domain
The CFD simulation model of the HI decomposer is presented in Fig. 2B. Size, properties, and boundary conditions identical to those of the actual operating system were applied, and then the CFD analysis was conducted using the Fluent program. Moreover, to describe the actual operating system, a user- defined function was applied. At  t  ¼  0  and  464.85  K  (191.7  ○C),  the  HIeI2eH2O  mixture  gas  with  flow  rates of
0.008 mol/s HI, 0.0002 mol/s I2, and 0.020 mol/s H2O was injected into the HI  decomposer  at an  absolute pressure of 5 kgf/cm2. Maintaining a fixed porosity of 0.4, the tempera- tures  of  the  electric  heaters  were  set  at  773.15  K  (500○C),
873.15K (600○C), and 973.15 K (700○C). The porosity value was approximately predicted by considering several parameters, such  as  the  reactor  size,  volume,  catalyst  density, catalyst
size, and amount of catalyst. The effect of the surface-to- volume (STV) ratio on hydrogen production was also consid- ered. When the reactor was developed, the STV ratio, defined as the specific surface of the catalyst, was approximately 0.4 in the preliminary simulation. The effects of setting the STV ratio at 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 on hydrogen production and reaction heat were investigated.
STV ratio ¼ A/V
where A is the surface area of the pore walls and V is the unit volume.
For efficient CFD analysis, the following criteria were assumed:
●The temperature of the heater was always maintained at the set temperature.
●N2 gas was fully filled inside the HI decomposer, as the initial condition of the simulation.
●The backward (reverse) reaction was not considered.
●The absolute pressure and temperature were set at 5 kgf/ cm2 (506,625 Pa) and 673.15 K (400○C), respectively, and then the mixture gas was injected.

3.Results and discussion
3.1.Effect of the heater temperature on hydrogen production
To investigate the effects of the heater temperature on hydrogen production, hydrogen production at HI decomposer temperatures of 773.15 K, 873.15 K, and 973.15 K were esti- mated at STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, as shown in Fig. 3. Under each condition, the amount of hydrogen produced was monitored at 10-minute intervals and the total operation time was 180 minutes.
Fig.  3A  shows  the  hydrogen  production  measured  at
773.15 K (heater temperature). Up to 20 minutes after the operation of the HI decomposer (i.e., after the start of the decomposition process), no hydrogen production occurred regardless of the STV ratio. From 20 minutes to 120 minutes, the amount of hydrogen production varied according to the STV ratio: the hydrogen production was 1.11e1.12 mol/h, 1.98e1.99 mol/h, and 3.09e3.10 mol/h at the STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. As presented in Fig. 3B, at 873.15 K, the amount of hydrogen produced was very low for 20 mi- nutes, but after 120 minutes, it increased according to the STV ratio. After 120 minutes, hydrogen  production  was 1.11e1.12 mol/h, 1.98e1.99 mol/h, and 3.09e3.10 mol/h at STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. Fig. 3C shows hydrogen production at 973.15 K. Similar to the reaction at 773.15 K and
873.15 K, the chemical reaction occurred, and then, hydrogen
was produced at 1.11e1.12 mol/h, 1.98e1.99 mol/h, and 3.09e3.10 mol/h at STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3AeC, hydrogen production was more strongly affected by the STV ratio than by the heat supplied by the heater. The inner temperature of the HI decomposer was higher    than    the    temperature     for catalyst    activation (T > 623.15 K) initially, and the inlet mass flow rate was the
same regardless of the heater temperature.
3.2.Reaction heat prediction with different STV ratios
Fig. 4AeC presents the heat of the reaction at STV ratios 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. The reaction was endothermic.  As  shown  in Fig. 4A, at an STV ratio of 0.3, the reaction heat was measured at different heater temperatures. A similar consumption of reaction heat was observed regardless of the heater temper- ature. After 60 minutes, the reaction heat required to produce hydrogen was 0.0827e0.0831 kW/h, whereas after 120 mi- nutes, when the hydrogen production was constant, it was 0.1116e0.117 kW/h. Therefore, the reaction heat increased with the increase of hydrogen production regardless of the temperature of the heater. Fig. 4B, C shows similar results at STV ratios of 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. At an STV ratio of 0.4, the reaction heat was 0e0.1604 kW/h regardless of the heater temperature; however, it increased with increasing hydrogen production. At an STV ratio of 0.5, the reaction heat was 0e0.2147 kW/h and showed a similar correlation with hydrogen production as that observed at the 0.4 STV ratio.

Fig. 5 e (continued).
As shown in Fig. 4AeC, the reaction heat used in the HI decomposition reaction for hydrogen production was corre- lated to the specific surface area of the catalyst and it had a direct relation with the production of hydrogen. However, the temperature changes of the HI decomposer had no direct ef- fect. The mixture gas was introduced into the HI decomposer when the heat supplied from the heater passed through the decomposer completely and the temperature was higher than the activation temperature (i.e., 673.15 K). Moreover, the temperature of the mixture gas from the preheating zone was increased up to the temperature needed for the catalyst decomposition reaction. Therefore, to enhance thermal effi- ciency, lowering the temperature of the heater was more ad- vantageous at the STV ratio.
3.3.Dependence of the HI decomposer inner temperature distribution on the heater temperature
The inner temperature distribution of the HI decomposer was monitored at different temperatures (773.15 K, 873.15 K, and
973.15 K) at various STV ratios (0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) during an operation time of 160 minutes (Fig. 5AeC). Moreover, the temperatures are presented in the form of area-weighted av- erages at inner thermocouple (ITC) 1e5. The temperature at the center of the catalyst zone was lower than that at the preheating zone for all STV ratios (Fig. 5A). The heat was used to catalyze the decomposition reaction. The temperatures of the outlet part, which discharged the mixture gas, and the temperature of the zone above the catalyst zone were rela- tively higher than that of the catalyst zone. The temperature distribution was as follows: 778e801 K at ITC 1, 779e792 K at
ITC 2, 777e794 K at ITC 3, 790e805 K at ITC 4, and 789e820 K at
ITC 5, regardless of the STV ratio.
Especially, at an STV ratio of 0.3, the temperatures of ITC 1, ITC 2, and ITC 3 at 973.13 K were higher than the tem- peratures at 773.15 K and 873.15 K for the same STV ratio (Fig. 5B). Because the decomposition is an endothermic re- action, it seems that less reaction heat was supplied, and therefore the inner temperature was higher at 973.15 K than in the other cases. Using different STV ratios, there was no significant difference in all of the temperatures. However, different trends were exhibited at various  temperatures  even if the differences were small. At 973.15 K, the inner temperature was found to be higher than in the other cases. The main reaction takes place well with the reaction tem- perature or more operation conditions, so it is not necessary to supply the over temperature.
3.4.Inner velocity and pressure of HI decomposer according to temperature change of heater
In Fig. 6AeC, the static pressure and velocity magnitude at STV ratios of 0.3e0.5 after 160 minutes of operation are pre- sented at three different heating temperatures. The static pressure and velocity magnitude are area weighted and averaged. As shown for positions AeE, the static pressure was
2.71 Pa at position A (0 mm), 26.95 Pa at position B (10 mm),
18.66Pa at position C (510 mm), 2.41  Pa  at  position  D  (1490 mm), and 2.25 Pa at position E (1500 mm). The mixture gas flowed to the preheating zone filled with the Al2O3 Raschig ring and it collided with the solid Al2O3 Raschig ring, thus generating  high  pressure.  Therefore,  a  pressure  drop  was

evident from the increase of the pressure value. When the mixture gas from the preheating zone flowed to the catalyst zone, a pressure drop was generated but the magnitude was smaller than in the previous case.
As shown for AeE, the velocity magnitude also had no cor- relation with the heater temperature and STV ratio. The ve- locity was 0.016 m/s at position A (0 mm), 0.04 m/s at position B (10 mm), 0.016 m/s at position C (510 mm), 0.016 m/s at position
D (1490 mm), and 0.14 m/s at position E (1500 mm). At the outlet at  position  E,  the  velocity  of  the  mixture  gas  was highest
(0.14 m/s). In the empty space (i.e., AeB), the velocity of the
mixture gas was 0.016e0.04 m/s, but it slowed down to 0.016 m/ s when the gas flowed to the BeD region that was filled with the solid. The gas collided with the solid upon decreasing the flow rate, and then the resulting mixture gas was well dispersed.
As shown in Fig. 6AeC, the static pressure and velocity magnitude were independent of the heater temperature and STV ratio, and this could be attributed to the fact that the fluid porosity was 0.4 in all cases. Therefore, the pressure drop of the flowing mixture gas and velocity drop were affected not by the thermal heat and surface area involved in the catalyst reaction, but were rather affected by fluid porosity (solid factor).
In conclusion, the CFD analysis for HI decomposition simulation was performed by applying the actual operation conditions and HI decomposer design. Several factors, such as hydrogen production, reaction heat, inner temperature, pressure, velocity, and mass distribution of the HI decom- poser, were investigated.
●The hydrogen production depended on the STV ratio. In this study, the predicted hydrogen production was
1.12 mol/h, 1.99 mol/h, and 3.10 mol/h for STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. The hydrogen production at an STV ratio of 0.5 was higher than that at 0.3 by 2 mol/h.
●For the three different STV ratios, the heat required for the HI decomposition reaction was investigated. With an increase in the amount of hydrogen production, the reaction heat increased, and its value was 0.1117 kW/h, 0.1604 kW/h, and 0.2147 kW/h at STV ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively.
●The inner temperature of the HI decomposer was studied in the form of contour images at ITC 1e5. A temperature higher than 750 K was required to generate the reaction stably. In addition, at ITC 2 and ITC 3 in the center of the catalyst zone, the temperature was 773e801 K, which was lower than that at the preheating region.
●The inner pressure and velocity of the HI decomposer were investigated through pressure drop and reducing velocity starting from the preheating zone. At this point, the pres- sure drop was approximately 24 Pa and the reducing ve- locity was 0.024 m/s.
For future research, the effect of fluid porosity and STV ratio on hydrogen production/reaction heat/hydraulic ther- mal analysis of the HI decomposer will be studied. The find- ings of this research can be used as a basis for the optimal design of the HI decomposer.
