ABSTRACT
In order to evaluate heterogeneity in nuclear inventories in the fuel debris of Units 1–3 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), detailed burnup calculations of fuel assemblies were performed. Applying publicly available information, speciﬁcations were modeled for the ﬁve diﬀerent types of fuel assemblies loaded in the cores before the shutdown for the  accident. The assembly burnup histories reported by Nishihara et al. were used to develop power histories at 24 axial nodes of the fuel assemblies adopting the measured data on the axial burnup proﬁles of similar fuel assemblies. A correlation between axial node power and  an in-channel void fraction was derived from the typical BWR core simulation analysis results and applied to the above-mentioned axial node power histories to obtain the in-channel void fraction histories. Then the burnup and cooling calculations were performed with CASMO5  and ORIGEN2.2 for each batch of fuel assemblies with the same irradiation periods. The calculated results were used to estimate the locally maximum contents of the nuclides such    as 235U, 238Pu, 239Pu, 240Pu, 241Pu, 241Am, 242Cm, 243Cm, 244Cm, 90Sr, 134Cs, 137Cs, and 154Eu,
which are important in the safety evaluation of the process of the disposal of the fuel debris.

1.Introduction
In an irradiated core of a commercial light water reactor, a large heterogeneity exists in nuclide inven- tories throughout the core. This is partly because the existence of fuel assemblies with diﬀerent irradiation periods results in diﬀerences in fuel burnup. The other factor is a burnup distribution in the axial direction of a fuel assembly which is attributed to neutron leakage from the peripheral regions of a reactor core. In a boiling water reactor, an in-channel void distribution in the axial direction of a fuel assembly is the other factor that causes the nuclide  inventory to change along the axial direction. Diﬀerent from a fuel assembly in a  pressurized   water reactor, the initial distribution of ﬁssile and burnable poison nuclides in the horizontal and axial directions is elaborated in a fuel assembly for a boil- ing water reactor. This have been introduced mainly due to the heterogeneity in the moderator density in   a fuel assembly and also for the fuel economy.
It is important to estimate the nuclide inventory distribution in the cores of Units 1–3 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant just before the accident, and also the decays and pileups of the nuclides along with cooling times in the assessment  of the states of the reactors and the safety evaluation of the process of the disposal of the fuel debris and radioactive materials. Shortly after the accident,
Nishihara et al. [1] analyzed the inventory  of  nuclides, radioactivity, and heat, photon and neutron generation rates for the fuel assemblies loaded in the cores and fuel storage pools of Units 1 to 4 at cooling times of 0 s through 106 y. They used the burnup data of the fuel assemblies provided by Tokyo Electric Company and classiﬁed them into  batches  of  the  fuel assemblies which were irradiated and cooled for the same periods. They developed the speciﬁc power history of each batch for the burnup calculations with the isotope generation and depletion calculation code ORIGEN2.2 which was developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [2]. They compiled the calcu- lated results for the diﬀerent batches to obtain the total values of the cores or storage pools for the abovementioned parameters in a unit, per core, for Units 1-3, and a unit, per fuel storage pool, for the fuel storage pools of Units 1–4.
Okumura et al. [3] reported a study where they analyzed the three-dimensional distributions of the nuclide inventories in the cores of the three Units. They developed burnup and in-channel void distri- butions in the axial direction of the fuel assemblies, and applied the same model as Nishihara et al. [1] for the speciﬁc power histories in the burnup calcula- tions. They used the analysis code MOSRA- SuperBacon [4] with a single fuel rod model equiva- lent to a 9 × 9 type boiling water fuel assembly in the burnup calculations.
The data in the unit, per core, reported by Nishihara et al. [1] are useful to generally understand the status of the cores which were melted in the accident and to make a plan for the disposal of fuel debris. In addition to the total core or average core data of each core, it would also be important to have information on the heterogeneity in the nuclide inventories in the cores. The aim of this study is to respond to this need. The modeled speciﬁcations of the fuel assemblies loaded in the core just before the accident were developed by referring to publicly available information in licensing documents and the other fuel vender’s reports on the currently used fuel assemblies, and adopting engineering modeling to compensate for the lack of information. In addition, the histories of the speciﬁc power and in-channel void distributions in the axial direction of the fuel assemblies were estimated based on the average fuel assembly speciﬁc power his- tories reported by Nishihara et al. [1].
The burnup calculations were performed using a lattice physics code CASMO5 [5] and the abovemen- tioned ORIGEN2.2 [2]. CASMO5 is the code devel- oped by Studsvik Scandpower for light water reactor fuel and has been used to prepare nuclear data libraries for reactor core simulation  nodal  codes.  One of the basic models is to calculate isotopic com- positions in nuclear fuel during irradiation and cool- ing based on burnup chains consisting of heavy, ﬁssion product and burnable poison nuclides. The geometrical model of CASMO5 is  two-dimensional to realize detailed speciﬁcations and conditions of light water reactor fuel assemblies and the neutron  cross-section libraries are prepared for 586 energy groups. ORIGEN2.2 can calculate the inventories of short half-life nuclides which are not included in the burnup chains of CASMO5 while the burnup model  is simple. The use of the two diﬀerent codes is  to make up for the disadvantaged points of both codes and also to conﬁrm the reliability of both calculated results by comparing them to each other. The calcu- lated results of CASMO5 were applied to obtain gen- eral information on the heterogeneity in the nuclide inventories for nuclides related to nuclear criticality and radiation protection.
Section 2 shows the modeling of the fuel assembly speciﬁcations and the burnup histories of the fuel assembly axial speciﬁc power and in-channel void fractions, and Section 3 presents the burnup calcula- tions. Section 4 describes the locally maximum con- tents in the core for nuclides related to nuclear criticality and radiation protection, and Section 5 gives conclusions.
2.Modeling of fuel assembly speciﬁcations of and burnup histories
The major speciﬁcations of the reactor cores of Units 1–3 are shown in Table 1 [6] which also gives infor- mation on the fuel assemblies which existed in the cores of the three Units at the shutdown in the accident in terms of the fuel assembly types and the numbers of fuel assemblies belonging to the same assembly types [7]. The bottom row of the table indicates the fuel assembly type IDs in this study.
2.1.Modeling of fuel assembly speciﬁcations
Table 2 shows the detailed speciﬁcations of the fuel assemblies which were taken from References [6,8,9,10], and [11]. In these references, the numerical values of the geometrical dimensions and the pellet densities were rounded numbers. It is noted that the 1F3-9 × 9–7 type fuel assemblies have eight part-length rods. The length of the MOX fuel rods in the 1F3- MOX8 × 8–4 type fuel assemblies is shorter than that of the UO2 fuel rods. In this study, the geometrical dimensions in the references were regarded as exact values. The thicknesses and materials of the fuel channel boxes were assumed as shown in the table based on the information on the General Electric (GE) 7 × 7 fuel assemblies [12]. The densities and isotopic composi- tions of Zircaloy (Zry)-2 and Zry-4 were taken from Reference [13] and shown in Table 3.
The References [6] and [11] provide the average assembly enrichments of the UO2 and MOX fuel assemblies, the average assembly plutonium concen- trations for the MOX fuel assembly and the ranges of

the Gd2O3 concentrations of the UO2-Gd2O3  fuel rods. The references also show the total core uranium weight for each UO2 fuel assembly type when the reactor core is loaded only with the  same  type  of  fuel assembly. Table 4 gives such information. As mentioned above, the distributions of ﬁssile and burnable poison materials in the fuel assemblies, which are referred to as the nuclear  design,  have been elaborated in the current BWR fuel assemblies. The nuclear design concept of the high-burnup fuel assemblies including the 1F1-8 × 8–4 and 1F3-9 × 9– 7 type fuel assemblies was reported in Reference [14]. It mentions about natural uranium fuel zones at the top and bottom ends, higher enrichment zones in the upper part and higher burnable poison concentration
zones in the lower part in the axial design. As a result, the fuel assemblies consists of diﬀerent axial segments in terms of the nuclear design. In addition,  References [6] and [11] show the concept  of  fuel-  rod enrichment distributions in the horizontal direc- tions of the fuel assemblies.
Referring to the enrichment distribution designs shown in References [6] and [11], the horizontal fuel- rod enrichment distributions of the assembly seg- ments except natural uranium zones were determined by iteration calculations using CASMO5 under the constraint that the maximum enrichment of fuel rods was less than 4.9 wt% and local power peaking factors at zero burnup were equal to or less  than about 1.3.  In this survey the fuel densities were the preliminary estimated values under the postulations that the the- oretical density of UO2 fuel was 10. 96 g/cm3, that of
UO2-Gd2O3 fuel was deﬁned by 10.96－0.04x where x
was  the  content  of  Gd2O3  in  wt%  [9,10]  and  the
density of the fabricated fuel pellets  was  96.5%  of  the theoretical densities. The value was assumed  based on the measured pellet  fabrication  data  [11,12]. Furthermore, a stuck density of  98%  was also assumed for considering chamfering fuel pellets. For the MOX fuel rods in the 1F3-MOX8 × 8–4 type

fuel assemblies, the density of the fabricated pellets was assumed to be 95.0% of the theoretical density  and the same stuck density as the UO2 fuel  pellets  was applied. Assuming that the gap between the fuel pellet and the fuel cladding was zero during irradia- tion, the smeared densities, which were obtained by ﬁlling fuel material inside of the fuel cladding, were used in the burnup calculations. After completing the horizontal design of the axial segments, the heavy metal weight of each fuel assembly type was obtained to calculate the U weight of the core where the fuel assemblies were fully loaded. The results were com- pared with those shown in Table 4. The ﬁnal pellet smeared densities were adjusted so that they repro- duced the U weights of the cores. Such adjusted smeared densities were used in the following burnup calculations. The heavy metal weights of the fuel assembly types determined in this way are shown in Table 4. For the 1F3-MOX8 × 8–4 type fuel assembly, such adjustment was not applied since the heavy  metal weight of the core was not available.
2.2.Modeling burnup histories
2.2.1.Assembly power history
Following Reference [1], the burnup histories of six batches for Unit 1, ﬁve for Unit 2 and six for Unit 3 were developed. Table 5 shows the relation between the batches and the fuel assembly types. The numer- ical number in the batch ID represents that of irra- diation cycles. The ‘m’ in the batch ID for Unit 3
means MOX fuel assemblies. The average assembly speciﬁc power in a unit, MW/tHM, for each cycle of each batch was reported in Reference [1]. Using the heavy metal weights of the fuel assemblies shown in Table 4, the assembly power in a unit, MW/assembly, was obtained for each cycle of each batch.
The fuel assembly was axially divided into  24 nodes in the eﬀective fuel length with an equal height. The height  of one node was 15.25  cm for  the  1F1-   8 × 8–4 and 1F1-9 × 9–9 fuel type assemblies, and 15.46 cm for the 1F2-9 × 9–9, 1F3-9 × 9–7, and 1F3-
MOX8 × 8–4 fuel type fuel assemblies. The nodes were numbered from the bottom to the top of the fuel assemblies. One relative axial node power distribu- tion was assigned to each type fuel assembly. The relative axial node power distributions were estimated based on measured axial burnup proﬁles of fuel rods which composed the lead use fuel assemblies (LUAs) [11,12]. This study adopted the measurements of a fuel rod in an 8 × 8–4 type LUA which were irra- diated for ﬁve cycles in Unit 2 of the Fukushima-Dai- ni NPP [11], and the measurements of full-length fuel rods in 9 × 9–9 and 9 × 9–7 type LUAs which were  irradiated for three cycles in Unit 1 of the same NPP [12]. The data of the 8 × 8–4 type LUA were regarded as the reference of the node power distributions in a unit, kW/node, for the 1F1-8 × 8–4 type fuel assem- bly, and that of the 9 × 9–9 type LUA as the reference of those of the 1F1-9 × 9–9 and 1F2-9 × 9–9 type fuel assemblies. As mentioned in the previous section, the 1F3-9 ×  9–7  type  fuel  assembly  includes  eight part-

length fuel rods, and the eﬀective fuel length of MOX fuel rods (the number of the fuel rods is 44) are shorter  that  of  UO2   fuel   rods   in   the   1F3- MOX8 × 8–4 type fuel assembly. There are diﬀer- ences in the number of fuel rods in one node in the axial direction in these type fuel assemblies. The data of the 9 × 9–7 type LUA were modiﬁed to take into account the diﬀerence in the fuel rod numbers along the axial direction in the 1F3-9 × 9–7 type fuel assembly for the reference of the axial node power distributions in the unit, kW/node. The data of the    9 × 9–9 type LUA were adopted to the axial speciﬁc power of the 1F3-MOX8 × 8–4 type fuel assembly taking into account the axial distribution of ﬁssile and burnable poison material of the assembly type. For  the axial node power  distribution  of  the  1F3-  MOX8  ×  8–4  type  fuel  assembly,  the  data  of  the 9 × 9–9 type LUA were modiﬁed to take into account the diﬀerence in the fuel rod numbers along the axial direction. Figure 1 shows the relative axial distribu- tions of node power for the ﬁve fuel assembly types. Applying the designated relative axial node distribu- tion to the assembly power for each cycle of each batch, the axial node power distribution  was obtained. The axial node power distribution was assumed to be constant in the same cycle. Then the axial node power was divided by the heavy metal weight in the node to determine the speciﬁc power    of the node in the unit, MW/tHM. The speciﬁc power of the node was used in the burnup calculations described in a later section.
2.2.2.In-channel void fraction history
In-channel void fraction distributions in  boiling water reactor cores are normally analyzed by reactor core simulation nodal codes adopting elaborate nuclear and thermal-hydraulics models and using
plant operating conditions. In order  to  come  up  with a simple empirical model on axial distributions of in-channel void fractions, analysis results by a reactor core simulation nodal code were studied on axial node power and an in-channel void fraction for  a typical fuel assembly irradiated for four cycles in equilibrium cores of a boiling water reactor which has a core power density and coolant ﬂow per assembly similar to those of Units 1 and 2. For each axial node, the in-channel void fraction was plotted against the node power, and it was observed that the void frac- tions in the lower nodes were zero, those in  the axially middle nodes almost linearly increased with the node power and those in the axially higher nodes rose with the node power and became roughly con- stant in the region of node power larger than a threshold value, even though the plotted points were largely scattered. Those trends of in-channel void fractions were formulated with linear functions against node power for each node. The correlation was commonly applied to the axial power distribu- tion of each cycle of each batch to determine the histories of the axial in-channel void fractions in the burnup calculations. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show exam- ples of the histories of the in-channel void fraction  distributions for batch b6 for Unit 1, batch b5  for Unit 2 and batch b5 for Unit 3, respectively. The average core in-channel void  fractions  just  before  the shutdown were calculated to be 0.33 for Unit 1,
0.43 for Unit 2 and 0.44 for Unit 3. References [6]
and [11] show that those of the core of Unit 1 fully  loaded with the 1F1-9 × 9–9 type fuel assemblies, the core of Unit 2 with the 1F2-9 × 9–9 type fuel assem- blies and the core of Unit 3 with the 1F3-9 × 9–7 type fuel assemblies are 0.31, 0.41, and 0.42, respectively, which correspond to the values at the condition of  the rated core coolant ﬂows. Taking into account that

the core ﬂows of Units 1, 2, and 3 were 84%, 88%,  and 94% of the rated core coolant ﬂows, respectively, just before the shutdown [13], the values of this study seemed to be reasonable.
3.Burnup calculation
3.1.Calculation conditions
For each batch, burnup calculations of 24 nodes were performed. The numbers of burnup calculation cases were 144 for Unit 1, 120 for Unit 2, and 144 for Unit 3. The lattice physics code CASMO5 [5] and the isotope generation and depletion calculation code ORIGEN2.2
[2] were used for the burnup calculations. The nuclear library of CASMO5 [14] and that of ORIGEN2.2 [15] were based on the evaluated nuclear data library JENDL-4.0 [16,17]. The libraries  of ORIGEN  2.2 used
in this study were BS200J40, BS240J40, and BS270J40 for the 1F1-8 × 8–4 type fuel assembly, BS300J40, BS340J40,  and  BS370J40  for  the  1F1-9  ×  9–9, 1F2-
9 × 9–9, and 1F3-9 × 9–7 type fuel assemblies, and BS2M040SJ40,   BS2M044SJ40   and   BS2M047SJ40 for
the 1F3-MOX8 × 8–4 type fuel assembly.
The burnup calculations of ORIGEN2.2 included nuclides in the structure materials of the fuel clad- ding, the water rods or the water channel and the fuel channel box in the fuel assemblies which were not considered in the burnup calculations of CASMO5. For the burnup calculations of both codes, the speci- ﬁc power (MW/tHM) and the burnup steps in a unit, day, were used, and each burnup step was set to be less than 15 days. The cooling calculations were per- formed at cooling times from 0 to 5 × 109 s (158.4 y). The inventory calculations were performed for the nuclides of heavy elements from U to Cf, ﬁssion

products from Ge to Ho, and 3H. The nuclide inven- tories of both codes were compiled for a node  averages value in a unit, g per cm (eﬀective fuel length), an assembly total value in a unit, g per assembly, and a core total value  in  a  unit,  g  per core. The radioactivity and decay heat of the nuclides were also calculated and compiled in the same ways as those in the inventory calculations. In the calcula- tions of CASMO5, the nuclide inventories in a unit, atoms per cm3 (fuel pellet), were also compiled for each fuel rod in each node.
As previously mentioned, the use of the two  codes is to make up  for  the  disadvantaged  point  of both codes and also conﬁrm the reliability of  both calculation results by comparing  them  to  each other. For instance, the calculated results of  the summation values of decay heat and
radioactivity of the nuclides obtained by ORIGEN2.2 are more reliable for short cooling times  and  those  by  CASMO5  are  more  precise for long cooling  times.  The  inventories,  decay heat and radioactivity  of  the  nuclides  by  CASMO5 are more accurate for short and long cooling times than those by ORIGEN2.2. The inventories, decay heat, and radioactivity of the nuclides in the structure materials are only avail- able in the calculation results of OROGEN2.2.
3.2. Calculated results
In order to conﬁrm the calculated results  of CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2, the inventories in each core for typical nuclides at cooling time zero were compared. The results are shown in Table 6. The
Table 6. Comparison of nuclide inventories of typical nuclides at the cooling time zero.nuclide inventories of uranium isotopes calculated with CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2 agreed  within  1%  for the three Units.
The diﬀerences in the inventories of plutonium, americium and curium isotopes were rather large between CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2. The inventories of ORIGEN2.2 were generally larger than those of CASMO5. This would mainly be because the micro- scopic cross-sections of actinide nuclides were pre- cisely calculated for each burnup step for each fuel rod in the CASMO5 calculations while the ORIGEN2.2 calculations adopted those  of  typical  fuel assembly designs and operating conditions.
For 90Sr and 137Cs, the diﬀerences in the inven- tories were rather small between CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2. The inventories of 134Cs and 154Eu are inﬂuenced by the neutron energy spectrum calcula- tion. The diﬀerences in those of CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2 are attributed to the diﬀerence in neu- tron spectrum calculation.
In this study, Gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) loaded in the UO2 fuel rods as the burnable poison was taken into account in the burnup calculations. The diﬀer- ences in the inventories of Gd isotopes were consid- erably large between those calculated by CASMO5 and  ORIGEN2.2 in this study as shown  in Table 6.  It is commonly understood that detailed neutron spectrum calculations are necessary to estimate pre- cise inventories of the burnable poison isotopes.
4.Locally maximum nuclide contents in the cores
The calculated results of CASMO5 provided the rod- by-rod nuclide inventories for each axial node in the fuel assembly. Using the results, the locally maximum contents were studied at long cooling times for some nuclides important in terms of nuclear reactivity and radioactivity. It is noted that the distribution of nuclide inventories in the axial direction in the node and that in the pellet were not considered here. With respect to nuclear reactivity, a ﬁssile nuclide 235U is included in
the most important nuclides for UO2 fuel assemblies, and 239Pu and 241Pu for MOX fuel assemblies. Considering the three-dimensional distribution in the cores, the contents of 235U were normally largest in the nodes which have the lowest burnup in the UO2 fuel assemblies of the one-cycle irradiation. The contents of 239Pu and 241Pu were also largest in the nodes which have the lowest burnup in the MOX fuel assemblies loaded in the core of Unit 3. The fuel rods with the  highest contents of these nuclides were also identiﬁed within those nodes. Table 7 shows the maximum con- tents in g/g-HM of the fuel rods which had the highest contents  of  235U,  239Pu,   and  241Pu  at  cooling  time 1 × 108 s (3.17 y). The table also shows the batches and nodes (-nx means an axial node x.) which included the relevant fuel rods, the average node burnups, the rod positions, the initial contents in g/g-HM (the weight of nuclide per the weight of initial heavy metal), the average core contents of those nuclides and the ratios of the maximum to average core contents. The survey was also  performed  the  cooling  calculation  results  at   5 × 108 s (15.85 y), and the results of the survey are shown in the table. The rod location is shown in the way that the rod (1,1) is located at the corner of a fuel assembly facing a W-W gap of fuel channels into which a control blade is inserted. The initial content  of the rods with the highest content of 235U was
4.9 × 102 g/g-HM. The contents of 235U and 239Pu
were almost the same between the two cooling times due to the long half-lives of those nuclides and small build up from the decay of Pu and Cm isotopes. The contents of 241Pu decreased on the decay constant cor- responding the half-life of 241Pu 14.290 y and the ratio was the same between the two cooling times.
With respect to radioactive nuclides, inventories were studied for 90Sr as a beta-ray source, 134Cs, 137Cs, and 154Eu as gamma-ray sources, and 238Pu, 239Pu,  240Pu, 241Am, 242Cm, 243Cm, and 244Cm as alpha-ray sources. The two nuclides 242Cm and 244Cm are also neutron sources. The highest contents of those nuclides were typically observed at the nodes of the highest  burnup in UO2 fuel assembly cores with some
Table 7.

For Unit 3, the MOX fuel assembly b1m was included since it may show the largest heterogeneity for the radioactive heavy nuclides. Table 8 shows the results for the three Units at cooling times 1 × 108 s (3.17 y) and 5 × 108 s (15.84 y). The table gives the maximum contents in the radioactivity per initial fuel weight (UO2 or MOX) (Bq/g-fuel) of the fuel rods which showed the highest contents. It also lists the batches and nodes which included the relevant fuel rods, the average node burnups, the rod positions, the maximum and average core contents, and the ratios of the max- imum to the average.
The nuclides of 90Sr and 137Cs are directly produced by ﬁssion and have a long half-lives of around 30 y; therefore, they build up during irradiation. The ratios of the maximum radioactivity to the average core radio- activity were similar to those of the fuel burnup of the rod in the node with the maximum burnup to the average core burnup. The nodes with the maximum burnup were 11 for  the  1F1-8  ×  8,  5  for  the  1F1- 9 × 9–9, 1F2-9 × 9–9, and 1F3-MOX8 × 8–4, and 12
for the 1F3-9 × 9–7 fuel assembly types. The nuclides of 134Cs and 154Eu are produced by neutron capture of 133Cs and 153Eu which are directly created by ﬁssion. Therefore, the inventories of 134Cs and 154Eu increase in proportion to the square of fuel burnup. This made the ratios of the activity larger than the ratios of the fuel rod burnup to the average core burnup. Since the half-life of 134Cs is relatively shorter and their inventory tends to saturate, the maximum radioactivity was not found in the batch b6, but in the batch b5. The nodes with the highest radioactivity of 154Eu tended to be located at higher axial positions than those with the highest aver- age node burnup. This is attributed to that the nuclide has the resonance integral 1.413 × 103 b, which is larger than the thermal cross-section 312.7 b [15], and their inventory increase in a harder neutron energy spec- trum. The neutron energy spectrum becomes harder at higher axial positions in the fuel assembly due to the axial distribution of in-channel void fractions. The ratios of the maximum to average core radioactivity for these ﬁssion product nuclides did not change between the two cooling times, as expected.
Preceding studies such as that by Roque et al. [18]
indicate that 238Pu in UO2 fuel irradiated in light  water reactors is mainly created in the chain:
241Pu(β, T1/2: 14.290 y) → 241Am(n, γ) → 242Am
(g)(β, T1/2: 16.02 h) → 242Cm(n, γ) → 243Cm, and
241Pu(β,  T1/2:  14.290  y)  → 241Am(n,  γ)  → 242Am
(m)(IT, T1/2: 141 y) → 242Am(g)(β, T1/2: 16.02 h) →
242Cm(n, γ) → 243Cm.
Here (m): a metastable state nuclide, (g): a ground state nuclide and IT: internal conversion decay. The nuclide of 244Cm is mainly evolved in the chain:
241Pu(n, γ) → 242Pu(n, γ) →243Pu(β, T1/2: 4.956 h)
→ 243Am(n, γ) → 244Am(β, T1/2: 10.1 h) → 244Cm.
The highest contents of 238Pu were observed in the nodes one-node higher than those with the highest  burnup. This indicates that the production of 238Pu is slightly inﬂuenced by the neutron energy spectrum. The ratios of the maximum to average core radio- activity were from 3.1 to 3.6, and they were larger than the ratio of the fuel rod burnup to the average core burnup. This is attributed to that the three neutron capture processes are involved in the pro- duction chain and the production rate is roughly proportional to the third power of a neutron ﬂux, while the burnup is almost proportional to the neu- tron ﬂux. The ratios of the maximum radioactivity to the average core radioactivity did not change between the two cooling times, as expected.
The inventories of the other heavy isotopes seemed to be strongly inﬂuenced by the neutron energy spec- trum and their highest contents were observed in the nodes axially higher than those with the highest burnup. This is likely caused by production of 239Pu  by neutron capture of 238U mainly in the resonance energy region. A neutron ﬂux in the resonance  energy region is larger in the axially higher nodes where in-channel void fractions are large. The ratios of the highest to average core radioactivity for 239Pu generally ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 and were smaller than those on the burnup. This is attributed to that the inventories of 239Pu tend to saturate due to elim- ination by ﬁssion reaction. The ratios of the max- imum average core radioactivity did not change between the two cooling times, as  expected,  for  239Pu. The inventories of 240Pu in the fuel rods with  the maximum contents slightly increased along with cooling time while those of average core burnup remained constant. This is attributed to the diﬀer-

Preceding studies including Okumura [19] indi- cate that the nuclides 241Am, 242Cm and 243Cm are mainly produced in the chain:

The ratios of the maximum contents to the average core contents increased with the mass number of Cm isotopes, since the number of neutron capture pro- cesses involved in the chain increased with the mass number of Cm isotopes and the inventories increased exponentially with the burnup. The ratios for 242Cm changed between the two cooling times apart  from the other isotopes. The rod locations of the maximum contents shifted between the two cooling times. The two cooling times were within the transient period in which the inventories of 242Cm (T1/2: 162.94 d) were governed by its half-life and by the parent nuclide of 242Am (m) (T1/2: 141 y), which possibly caused the change in the ratios between the two cooling times.
For the MOX fuel assembly of Unit 3, the largest radioactivity of 239Pu was seen in the node with the lowest burnup, as expected, while those  for  240Pu, 241Am and 242Cm were in the nodes with the maximum
burnup. Those of the other heavy isotopes were located in the nodes located axially higher than those with the maximum burnup. Comparison of the ratios between the MOX fuel and UO2 fuel assemblies for Unit 3 indicated that the ratios for 238Pu, 239Pu, 240Pu,  241Am, and 242Cm were larger in the MOX fuel assemblies.
5.Conclusions
The speciﬁcations were modeled for the ﬁve diﬀerent BWR-type fuel assemblies which were loaded in the cores of Units 1–3 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP before the shutdown for the accident. Using the average fuel assembly burnup for the batches of the fuel assemblies which were irradiated and cooled for the same periods in the three Units, the irradiation histories of the axial power and in-channel void fraction distributions were developed and applied to the burnup and cooling calcu- lations by using CASMO5 and ORIGEN2.2.
For the nuclides important to nuclear criticality and radiation protection, the average core contents and the locally maximum contents were obtained based on the calculation results of CASMO5 at cool- ing times 3.17 and 15.85 y as typical intermediate cooling times. The ratios of the maximum to average core contents of 235U were from 2.4 to 3.0  in  the  cores of Units 1  to  3.  Those  of  239Pu  and  241Pu were from 7.7 to 7.4 for the  core  of  Unit  3 where the MOX fuel assemblies were loaded. The ratios of the radioactive ﬁssion product nuclides 90Sr, 134Cs, 137Cs, and 154Eu were from 1.9 to 3.3 in the cores of Units 1 to 3. The ratios of the radioactive heavy nuclide  238Pu,  239Pu,  240Pu,  241Am,  242Cm,   243Cm, and 244Cm were scattered from 1.7 to 16.0.
This study indicated that the heterogeneity in the inventories of the studied nuclides in the cores were signiﬁcant and, therefore, it should properly be
considered in the safety analysis of  the  process  of  the disposal of the fuel debris and radioactive materi- als. The results of this study were obtained based on the modeled fuel assemblies and burnup histories so that they gave approximate estimations for the het- erogeneity in the nuclear inventories.
