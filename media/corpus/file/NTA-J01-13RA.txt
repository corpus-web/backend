ABSTRACT
Known as the “heart of the nuclear island,” the nuclear coolant pump of the CAP1400 nuclear power unit is the only device that cannot be manufactured domestically (in China). Nevertheless, the rotating impeller and the static vane are the most important flow passage components. The efficiency and head, the pressure pulsation, the radial forces, and the axial forces are the main performance factors of operating stability in a coolant pump. To evaluate the effects of the impeller blades and the vane blades on the above performance factors, a united optimal design technology comprised of a constrained shape design methodology, the CFD analysis, the LHS method, the predicting model, and the MOPSO algorithm was proposed. Taking the 1:2.5 scaled hydraulic model with a relatively-high performance as the target, three groups of optimized impeller blades and vane blades were obtained. A comparative analysis led to the following conclusions: the optimized impeller blades and the opti- mized vane blades can both improve the pump’s efficiency, head, and axial forces; the optimized vane blades can decrease almost all of the monitoring pressure pulsation’s amplitudes in the coolant pump, but the optimized impeller blades can only improve the amplitudes in the impeller domain; the optimized vane blades can greatly decrease the radial forces, however, the optimized impeller blades do not seem to have any clear effect on the radial forces; relative to the optimized vane blades, the impeller blades can produce a wider change in the axial force.

1.Introduction
China is currently developing an advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) unit CAP1400 based on an imported AP1000 unit (Zou et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2018a). Compared to AP1000, which was invented
by America’s Westinghouse, CAP1400’s running power has been increased from 1000-MW to 1400-MW, causing a flow volume to in- crease from 17886 m3/h to 21642 m3/h, and the rotating speed has been
changed from 1750 r/min to 1485 r/min due to the nationalization, as presented in Fig. 1. The above changes are likely to lower the perfor- mance, however, the performance of the CAP1400 nuclear coolant pump is required to be no lower than AP1000. As a result, it has to be redesigned with respect to the pressure-bearing boundary, the perfor- mance requirements, the install constraints, etc.
As the only rotating part in the first loop of the nuclear island, the nuclear coolant pump provides decades of sustained circulating power
without needing a replacement (Xu et al., 2018; Long et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). To satisfy the high temperature, high pressure, and high radiation working environment, much more attention has been paid in design to the safety and stability of the coolant pump (Cheng et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2016a).
In terms of the hydraulic design of the nuclear coolant pump, many studies related to the specific components have already been conducted: Fu et al. (Wang et al., 2019) investigated the effect of blade inlet position on the pump’s flow characteristics and drew an optimal scheme; Zhou et al. (Fu et al., 2016) compared the effects of different staggered blades and found that staggered blades can significantly reduce the pressure pulsation amplitude on the impeller pass frequency; setting the meridian surface as the optimal design target, Wang et al. (Lu and Wang, 2019) adopted the medial axial transform theory to increase the performance and decrease the axial thrust of the impeller in the nuclear coolant pump; Ni et al. (Wang and Lu, 2018) and Lu et al. (Ni et al., 2017) have done some research on the vane design of the nuclear coolant pump and

obtained the new vanes to decrease the pressure pulsation inside the pump.
Most of the previous studies have focused primarily on the local optimal design, lacking the investigation of the main components’ effect on the specific performance factors. However, as presented in Fig. 2, the following key performance factors need to be addressed in the devel- opment of the hydraulic model: the efficiency and head performances, the pressure pulsation, the radial forces, and the axial forces. Many studies address those performance factors only partially, but a mere summary of the comprehensive influence of these four performance factors is not enough. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of the impeller blades and vane blades on the key performance factors.
The impeller blades and vane blades are studied here for the following reasons: both of them are critical to the internal structure of the hydraulic components (the impeller blades delivering the fluid me- dium, and the vane blades guiding the direction of the flow). Concerning the adjustment of the other structures (such as the meridian surface), the change of blades can leave the hydraulic components’ assembly clear- ance and install space unchanged. Additionally, the blades have a great

influence on the pump’s performance, making its analysis results much more credible.
A detailed investigation of the effects of the impeller blades and vane blades on the coolant pumps’ performance factors was conducted using    a scaled hydraulic model (on a scale of 1:2.5) of the coolant pump CAP1400 as the reference. The study is organized as follows: Part 1 gives the research background and significance of this study; Part 2 illustrates the specific details about the target pump as well as the performance evaluation approach; Part 3 describes the research route; Part 4 gives the united optimal design technology established by the new blade design approach and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm; Part 5 investigates the effects of the  optimized  impeller  blades and vane blades on the performances comprised of the steady performances, the pressure pulsation, the radial forces, and the axial forces; Part 6 provides the conclusions.
2.The target pump and numerical method
2.1.The target pump
Presented in Table 1, the hydraulic schemes with a different number of blades are based on the rotor-stator interaction principle (Zhang et al., 2017), which serves as the basis for the design of many hydraulic models (Lu et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2018; Long et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2016a; Zhang, 2012). In the table, the 1:2.5 scaled hydraulic model with 6 impeller blades and 15 vane blades is chosen to be the study target. The number of the impeller blades and vane blades falls in the medial position of the recommended values listed in Table 1, and has representative significance. The corresponding install location and structure are shown in Fig. 3.
Further, the scaled hydraulic model in Fig. 3 was chosen for analysis because of its >81% efficiency and high performance compared to other similar structures (Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). Therefore, the corresponding analysis results are much more persuasive. Additionally, in the 1:1 real machine test, this model faced the high-pressure pulsation and high-vibration phenomenon. Consequently, being adopted for further analysis meets the practical engineering needs.
Previous research has reported that a pump’s performance in the

described scaled hydraulic model can be evaluated by using water at 25
�C as the fluid medium (Ni et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2013). The test rig providing the validating data for the numerical method  has been set up  by the National Industrial Pump Quality Supervision and Testing Center of China, and it is presented in Fig. 4. During the testing process, the design mass flow was Qd 384 kg/s; the inlet pressure and the rotation speed was 1 atm and 1485 r/min, respectively.
2.2.The numerical method
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a relatively quick and effi- cient approach for assessing the pump’s performance. However, first, its effectiveness needs to be validated. In this section, the numerical method’s main settings, including the boundary condition, the turbu- lence model, and the mesh scheme are established.
The simulation process was implemented in the Solver of the ANSYS- CFX 18.2. For boundary conditions, the inlet and outlet conditions were

set as described in Part 2.1. The technique of the multiple moving reference frames was used to set up the rotating impeller zone at 1485 r/ min, and the interfaces between the rotor and the stator were set as the
“Frozen Rotor” mode. Also, along with the second-order upwind dis- cretization for the convection term, the convergence criterion was set at 10—4.
The RANS equation is often applied to the pump simulation progress in combination with other control equations. On account of Reynolds Stress, the turbulence model was imported to close the related equa- tions. In terms of the turbulence models selected for the pump optimi- zation process, the standard k-ε model and the SST model were much more preferred. Using the final identified mesh schema in Table 2, Fig. 6 presents the simulation results using these two turbulence models. It can be seen from the figure that the simulation results with the standard k-ε model are much closer to the experimental results. As a result, the standard k-ε model was adopted in the simulation process.
Establishing a grid scale is another crucial step. The hydraulic components were configured with the UG software and meshed with the ICEM software. During the meshing process, the meshes in the case were the hybrid meshes, while the other zones adopted the hexahedral meshes. Consequently, with the distributed meshes in Fig. 5, three meshes in Table 2 were evaluated. It can be found from the table that when the grid number reaches about 4 million, the corresponding result remains stable. It was thus adopted into the simulation process based on its efficiency and accuracy.
With the settled mesh scheme in Table 2, the scaled hydraulic model’s performances from 0.7Qd to 1.3Qd were calculated, and their results are presented in Fig. 6 along with the experimental results. It can be found from the figure that the simulation results have the same in- crease and decrease interval. Most importantly, the data error between the simulation result and the experimental result is within 1% at the design point. Thus, the adopted numerical method is reliable and should be applied to the process of analysis in this study.
3.The research route
As mentioned previously, the impeller blades and the vane blades are the most important internal structures of a hydraulic component. Therefore, their effects on the coolant pump’s steady performance fac- tors (efficiency and head performances) and unsteady performance factors (pressure pulsation, radial forces, and axial forces) have to be evaluated. To explore and clarify their influences, a variable-controlling approach was adopted, namely, the shapes of the vane blades and the impeller blades were changed separately, and the corresponding effects on the pump performances were observed and evaluated.
Setting the blades as the regulating objects, Fig. 7 shows the research route. On the route, with no changes in the assembly clearance and install space, the impeller blades and vane blades were separately configured with the optimal design technology. Then, by comparing the optimized results with the target, the degree of influence on the coolant pump’s performance was analyzed and ranked.
4.The united optimal design approach to get the analyzed structures
This part focused on the study of the hydraulic model presented in Fig. 3(b). For analysis, the impeller blades and the vane blades of the model were optimized and configured separately using a united optimal design approach.
Fig. 8 provides the flowchart of the output of the analyzed structures, whose main steps are as follows:
Step 1. The vane blade and the impeller blade were imported into the optimization process separately.
Step 2. The samples with the combination of the newly proposed constrained design approach and the LHS approach were settled down.
Step 3. The database with the corresponding design variables was generated, and the samples’ performances were simulated.

Fig. 10. Sketch presentation of the non-dimensional variables determining the impeller and vane blades.
Step 4. A prediction model describing the mathematical relationships between the design variables and the performances was established. Step 5. Optimal samples were optimized and produced from the prediction model and the MOPSO algorithm.
Step 6. Components’ importance was evaluated through a compar- ative analysis between the optimized impeller blade and vane blade.
4.1.A united constrained design approach to designing the vane and  impeller blades
To design the impeller blade and the vane blade, the following fac- tors need to be considered: 1) the meridional channel, 2) the blade thickness, 3) the blade number, 4) the stacking law, and 5) the distrib- uting angle (the install angle or the wrap angle) or its determined var-iables (the loading pressure or the swirl velocity). Among the above factors, 1 and 4 would remain fixed to keep the assembly clearance and install space unchanged. When compared to 2 and 3, 5 was better able to control the 3D flow (Bing et al., 2013). Therefore, it was selected as the research focus of this study.
The impeller is a rotating component, while the vane is a static component. As mentioned previously, they do not have the same func- tions, so their blades should be represented and designed differently, as shown in Fig. 9.
Principle of the impeller blade design In Fig. 9(a), the wrap angles are adapted to control the impeller blade shape. The wrap angle θ is calculated with the following formula using the swirl velocity rVθ s (Kim et al., 2015):
@1
whereωrepresents the rotating velocity of the impeller; r is the known radial coordinate; Vm is the meridian velocity, which can be settled down with the known meridian surface. Therefore, rVθ s becomes the unique variable to determine the impeller blade.
The distribution of the swirl velocity rVθ s can be further described as follows:
@2
where g1 s represents the non-dimensional swirl velocity; r1Vθ1, r2Vθ2 are the swirl velocity at the inlet and outlet, respectively, which can be settled down with the following formulas (Peng et al., 2002):
@3
@4
@5
Using Eq. (1) through Eq. (5), we can find that the wrap angles in Fig. 8(a) can be represented with the non-dimensional swirl velocity  g1 s , which will be introduced next.
Principle of the vane blade design In Fig. 9(b), the install angles are applied to control the vane blade shape. Concerning turboma- chinery, the role between the wrap angle and the install angle can be transformed with the following formula (Lu et al., 2018b):
@6
where r is the known radial coordinate; sis the known streamline loca- tion. Therefore, β s becomes the unique variable to determine the shape of the vane blade.
The distribution of the install angle β s can be further described as follows:
@7
where g2 s represents the non-dimensional install angle; β2 is the install angle at the outlet, whose range is recommended to be between 29� and 43� according to Ref (Liu and Tan, 2013); β1 is the install angle at the inlet, and can be calculated as follows:
@8
@9
@10
Eq. (6) to Eq. (10) allow us to find that the install angles of Fig. 9(b)

can be represented with the non-dimensional install angle g2 s , which will be introduced next.
A united constrained design approach to describing the crucial design variables Based on  previous  research (Lu et  al.,  2018c;  Tan  et al., 2010), the non-dimensional variables  g1  s  and  g2  s  increase along the streamline. A quadratic polynomial can be used to describe these two variables with the same distributing law:
@11
where A; B; C; D; E are the coefficients.
Fig. 10 shows the distributing trend ofgi s , and the following multi- source mathematical constraints are adopted to quantitatively describe this phenomenon:
@12
@13
@14
So to further describe the increasing trend of the non-dimensional variables, the following constrained equation is added:
@15
The Kutta-Joukowski condition (Cao et al., 2005) implies that the variables at the leading edge should present a smooth transition:
@16
At the trailing edge, the following constraint should be satisfied with Eq. (15):
@17
with the further simplification of Eq. (11) through Eq (17), the following constraints can  be
@18
Variables A; P along with Eq. (18) allow for a calculation of the other coefficients in Eq. (11). Consequently, Eq. (18) can be further trans- formed according to the range of s:obtained  as follows:
@19
Based on Eq. (19), a corresponding deduced constrained zone of
Fig. 11 is calculated.
From Fig. 11, the variables P; A are selected from the marked multi- source constrained zone. After getting these two known variables, the

Once giðsÞ is identified, the angles for the impeller and vane blade can be shaped separately with Eq. (1) and Eq. (7).
4.2.Optimal design of the  impeller blade
With the other matched hydraulic components unchanged,  the impeller blade was set as the unique optimization object. The optimal design system comprised of the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) methodology, the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) model, and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) has already been given in Fig. 8. The introduction of CFD is presented in Part 2.2, while the specific principles of LHS, RBF, and MOPSO can be found in Ref. (Lu and Wang, 2019; Zangeneh, 1991; Zangeneh, 1991, 1991; Pei et al., 2016b). The main  settings and the optimal results during the optimization  process  are  given in detail next.
The design variables and their ranges need to be established before optimization. As shown in Fig. 12, three cross-sections consisting of the hub side, the middle side, and the shroud side are utilized to configure

the impeller blade. Setting the swirl velocity as the key design factor, Table 3 lists the determined variables and their ranges.
As shown in Tab 3, Ph; ah; Pm; am; Ps; as are the variables used to control the non-dimensional swirl velocities of the hub, middle, and shroud side in Fig. 12. Additionally, r1Vθ1,h, r1Vθ1,m, and r1Vθ1,s denote the swirl velocities at the hub, middle, and shroud side, while the swirl velocities at the outlet adopt the united manner of r2Vθ,2. Aside from establishing the design variables and their ranges, two constraints guaranteeing the generation of effective impeller blade structures are added to Table 3 based on Ref. (Peng et al., 2002).
Determining samples in the optimization system presented in Fig. 8 is crucial. Two steps should be followed to generate satisfactory samples for the irregular sample generation zone presented in Fig. 12:
Step 1. The initial samples are generated with the LHS method. The irregular zone is extended to the smallest regular rectangle zone of Fig. 13. The LHS method is then continually used to generate uniformly-distributed samples in the design space.
Step 2. Satisfactory samples are outputted with the consideration of the actual needs. Two kinds of constraints are adopted. First, the samples from the regular rectangle zone are reduced to the irregular zone. Second, the generated impeller blades’ wrap angles should present an increasing trend from the hub to the shroud as shown in Table 3.
At first, the sample scale needs to be identified. Too many samples would take too much calculating time. However, an insufficient number of samples may lead to a failure in optimization. Table 4 lists possible groups as well as the number of samples at different steps. The minimum sample number can be determined with the formula N 1 N 2 =2 (Liu and Tan, 2013). There are N 10 design variables in Table 3, which means that the number of samples should be larger than 66. For the sake of conservatism, the sampling scheme with 2000 samples (Group 5) at Step 1 was adopted.
The sample distribution at different steps of Group 5 is presented in Fig. 13. Once the final samples of Fig. 13(b) have been determined, the impeller blades were configured with the design principle introduced in Part 3.1, and the corresponding pump performances were evaluated with CFD of Part 2.2.
To establish the mathematical relationship between the design var-

iables and the pump performances, the RBF model was adopted. The ninety-nine samples presented in Fig. 13(b) were used to establish the predictive model, while the other ten samples were applied to evalu-
ating the reliability of the RBF model. Fig. 14 shows the testing results and the calculated goodness of fitting R2 with the following formula:
@21
where Yi denotes the predicted results; Yi represents the actual simu- lated performances in the CFD analysis; Yi is the mean value of Yi.
R2 of the efficiency performance and the head performance obtained from the RBF model were both higher than 0.9, which satisfied the predictive model’s basic requirements in similar studies (Ni et al., 2017; Zangeneh, 1991).
With the identified predictive model, the MOPSO algorithm was then applied to search for the optimal results. The optimization object was set as follows:
@22
Aside from the object of optimization, the other settings were set as follows: the particles’ number 10; the iteration steps 100; the global increment factor and the inertia factor	0.9; the maximum velocity 0.1.
After the implementation of the MOPSO algorithm, Fig. 15 (a) shows the Pareto front. To exclude the influence of any accidental factors, three scatter optimal results from the Pareto front were selected for further analysis. Fig. 15(b) shows the install angle distributions of the optimal results. Further analysis would be presented in Part 5.

The summary information for the optimization results.
4.3.Optimal design of the vane blade
Similar to the impeller blade, the vane blade is taken here as the unique optimal object. Fig. 16 presents the design variables controlling the non-dimensional install angle distributions that were generated from the deduced constrained zone identified in Fig. 11.
Table 5 gives the details of the vane blade’s design variables. In the table, the range of β1_h, β1_m, β1_s, and β2 was obtained based on the vane blade design principle in Part 3.1. Then, with the same sampling method in Part 3.2, 142 of the initial 1000 samples were selected, and the results are shown in Fig. 17.
With the samples in Fig. 17, the vane blades were configured step by step, and then their performances were simulated with CFD. Also, 132 random samples were used to establish the predictive model of RBF, while the rest were applied to evaluating its effectiveness. Then, based

on the embodied predicting model, the MOPSO algorithm was then adopted used to find the optimal structures. The basic settings were the same as in Part 4.2, while the optimization object was as follows:
@23
Based on the optimization object of Eq. (23) and the same settings as in Part 4.2, the MOPSO algorithm was run to optimize the vane blade. Three optimal results and the corresponding install angle distributions are presented in Fig. 18. Further analysis will be presented in Part 5.
5.Investigation of the effects of the optimized structures on the pump performances
With the matching components remaining unchanged, the repre- sentative structures, namely the impeller blade and the vane blade, were optimized in Part 4.2 and Part 4.3, respectively. Then, as presented in Figs. 7 and 8, the optimized results would be further compared and analyzed. By doing a comparative analysis of the install angle distribu- tions in Figs. 15(b) and Fig. 18(b), it can be found that the new design structures were widely different from the target, producing statistically significant results.
Fig. 25. Investigation of the effects on the axial forces.
Steady analysis The optimized results and the target were simulated under the steady condition. The performance of the pump under the designed condition is shown in Table 6. Information in the table dem- onstrates that the optimized impeller blades and the optimized vane blades both can improve the pump performance.
However, the comparative analysis showed that the vane blade has a greater influence on the pump performance than the impeller blade. Fig. 19 provides evidence for this by showing the turbulence kinetic energy and streamline distribution. The turbulence kinetic energy is an important variable that assesses the structure’s ability to avoid turbu- lence (Liu and Tan, 2013). In the figure, the optimized vane blades could improve the flow and reduce the turbulence of kinetic energy, which satisfied the simulating performances listed in Table 6.
Unsteady analysis The steady results presented above denote a preliminary conclusion that the vane blade has a much greater effect on the pump’s performance. To present the inner flow characteristics changing with time, the unsteady analysis was then conducted based on the steady results.
Unlike the settings of the steady simulation in Part 2.2, the interfaces between the rotating component and the stating component were set to the “Transient Rotor Stator” mode. Additionally, three kinds of time steps (Δt1     2:24   10—4s;Δt2     4:49    10—4s;Δt3     6:73    10—4s) were
chosen to be explored. At each time step, the maximum iteration steps were set to be lower than 20, and the single-step convergence was 10—7.
Four monitoring points comprised of P11, P20, M1, and MM1 were uti- lized to present the pressure pulsation during the above three time steps. It is evident that minor errors exist between different time steps. As a result, considering the time cost and the calculating accuracy Δt2 ¼ 4:
49 10—4s was selected as the time step for this study.
Using the identified settings as described above, the unsteady per- formances were simulated. The simulation results became stable after calculating 12 circles. During the simulating process, 12 monitoring points located in the impeller domain (P10, P11, P20, P21), the Roter-Stator interface (M1, M2, M3, M4), and the casing (MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4) were distributed. Their corresponding pressure pulsations are shown in Fig. 21 and Fig. 22. In Fig. 21(a), the pressure time-domain presents a large change, which is caused by the transformation of the impeller blade. However, the pressure-time domain reveals small dis- turbances in Fig. 22(a), which means that the change of the vane blade can influence the pressure of the upstream impeller domain. As for the four monitoring points MM1 ~ MM4 in Figs. 21(c) and Fig. 22 (c), the pressure fluctuation of the optimal samples is larger than the target, which satisfies the head improvement phenomenon.
Aiming at the pressure pulsation in Figs. 21 and 22, Fig. 23 shows the corresponding frequency spectra with FFT, namely, Fig. 23(a),(c),  and
(e) present the results of the optimization of the impeller blades, and Fig. 23(b),(d), and (f) show the results of the optimization of the vane blades. The rotational frequency for the pump is fr n/60 24.75 Hz. In terms of the calculated frequency spectra in Fig. 23, the four monitoring points of the impeller blade (P10~P22) have a dominant frequency of 1 fr, while the monitoring points of the Rotor-Stator intersection (M1~M4) and the case (MM1~MM4) all have a dominant frequency of
6	fr, which satisfies the basic law in related studies (Wang and Lu, 2018; Ni et al., 2017). As marked in the purple box, it can be found that the optimized vane blades can make almost all of the amplitudes in the impeller domain, the Rotor-Stator interface, and the casing decrease. However, the optimized impeller blades can only improve the ampli- tudes in the impeller domain. Consequently, it can be concluded that the vane has a greater influence on the pressure pulsation than the impeller. Aside from the pressure pulsation, the radial force is another important factor in determining the operational stability of the coolant pump. The radial forceFf can be represented with the integrated pressure
on the impeller blade, and it can be calculated as follows:
@24
@25
@26
where Fx upper; Fx shroud; Fx hub; Fx blade; Fx down are the separate X radial forces on the five marked areas of Fig. 19(a), and Fy upper; Fy shroud; Fy hub; Fy blade; Fy down are the separate Y radial forces.
Fig. 24 shows the radial forces calculated with the above equations. A comparative analysis of them and the target shows that the optimized vane blades can decrease radial forces. However, the optimized impeller blades do not seem to have any obvious effect on the improvement of the radial forces.
The axial forces continued to be analyzed. The axial force Fz was calculated with the following formula:
@27
where Fz upper; Fz shroud; Fz hub; Fz blade; Fz down are the axial forces on the five marked areas represented in Fig. 20(a).
Fig. 25 shows the calculated axial forces, and the results denote that both the optimized impeller blades and the optimized vane blades can decrease axial forces. However, the optimized impeller blades can make the values of the axial force have a wider range of change.
6.Conclusions
Prompted by lack of comparative research on the effects of the nu- clear coolant pump’s main components on its overall performance, a united optimal design technology is used to evaluate the effects of the key structures (the impeller blades and the vane blades) on the pump performances (the efficiency and head, the pressure pulsation, the radial forces, and the axial forces). The conclusions of the study are as follows:(1)A united shape design methodology for the impeller blade and the vane blade is proposed. By analyzing previous design equations and consulting the references, the swirl velocity and the install angle are determined to be the key design variables for the impeller blade and the vane blade, respectively. To increase these two crucial design variables, the united non-dimensional formulas are defined, and a sail-like constrained zone is determined.
(2)A united optimal design technology for superior  impeller  and  vane blades is proposed. Based on the united constrained design approach, the optimal design technology comprised of the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) methodology, the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) model, and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) can effectively produce the optimal structures.
(3)Through a comparative analysis of the effects of the optimized impeller and vanes blades on the pump’s performance, the following findings could be made:
●The optimized impeller blades and the optimized vane blades can both improve the pump’s efficiency and head performance, but the latter has a much stronger impact.
●The optimized vane blades can decrease almost all of the pressure pulsation’s amplitudes in the impeller domain, the Roter-Stator interface, and the casing. However, the optimized impeller blades can only improve the amplitudes in the impeller domain.
●The optimized vane blades can decrease the radial forces. How- ever, the optimized 1impeller blades do not seem to have an obvious effect on the radial forces.
●The optimized impeller blades and the optimized vane blades can both decrease the axial forces, but the former can make the values of the axial force have a wider change range.
Overall, the above study denotes that the role of the vane blade, which was often ignored in the previous studies, is significant for the nuclear coolant pump’s hydraulic design. The study is expected to provide a technical reference for the design and performance improve-
