Abstract
This paper deals with the estimation of E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3 of the Pu 3+∣∣Pu redox couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt using statistical data fitting of experimental data. The E∗∘Pu3+|Pu value was also estimated in our laboratory at 723 and 773 K using logarithmic analysis of semi-integral voltammograms and chronopotentiograms. From semi-integral curves, E∗∘Pu3+|Pu was found to be −2.888 ± 0.021 and −2.810 ± 0.021 V at 723 and 773 K, respectively, whereas it was −2.851 ± 0.020 V at 773 K from the analysis of chronopotentiograms. Based on subsequent statistical analysis, we recommend the following expressions for E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3 applicable for the temperature range 673 to 823 K:E∘Pu3+|PuversusCl−|Cl2(V)=−(3.325±0.117)+(7.212±1.571)×10−4T(K)andΔfG∘PuCl3(J/mol)=−(962738±33982)+(208.8±45.5)T(K).The γPuCl3 value in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt was estimated from ΔfG∘PuCl3,liq. calculated for the reactionPu(s)+32Cl2(g)→PuCl3(liq.)using FactSage package, and it was expressed asRTlnγPuCl3(J/mol)=−69954+53.284T(K).

I. INTRODUCTION
Recovery of uranium and plutonium from spent U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel by pyroprocessing scheme has two stages. The first stage in which solid steel cathode is used for electrodeposition of uranium, and the second stage where liquid cadmium cathode is used at which uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides are codeposited.1–4 At the beginning of the first electrorefining campaign at solid steel cathode, LiCl-KCl eutectic melt consists of only UCl3, and with several batches of electrorefining campaigns at solid steel cathode, there is a gradual increase in composition of PuCl3 thereby increasing the (PuU)melt ratio in melt. According to Till and Chang, when there is an equilibrium among UCl3, PuCl3 and cadmium in which both U and Pu are saturated (PuU)melt=4.1.5 This estimation was based on ΔfG∘PuCl3 obtained from electromotive force (emf) measurements on the Pu 3+∣∣Pu couple versus Ag +|Ag as reference in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt by Campbell and Leary.6 The dissolution and deposition characteristics of uranium and plutonium at inert and liquid metal electrodes and mass transfer in molten salts and liquid metals were reviewed by Willit et al. in 1992 in which experimental work on electrorefining of integral fast reactor fuel from 1943 to 1991 was comprehensively discussed.7
In this work, we restrict our review to experimental work on the Pu 3+∣∣Pu couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt carried out for estimating E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3. Different experimental conditions, such as temperature xPuCl3 in melt and xAgCl used for the Ag +|Ag reference electrode, and techniques, such as emf or voltammetric and controlled current methods, were employed for these measurements. One of the main objectives of such experimental work was to evaluate the relative thermodynamic stabilities of uranium, plutonium, zirconium, minor actinides, and lanthanides to eventually understand the dissolution behavior of spent metal fuels and the deposition characteristics of uranium and plutonium.8 Experiments in this direction should finally lead to estimations of E∘ of the respective redox couples and ΔfG∘ of the respective chlorides.
In order to have consistency in material balance calculations and modeling of deposition of actinides during electrorefining,9 the E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3 derived out of statistical analysis of literature data is of foremost significance. The present work is an attempt in this direction in that we explore and critically survey literature data on electrochemical investigations on the Pu 3+∣∣Pu system in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt, categorize them on the basis of technique used, and arrive at expressions for E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3 using statistical data fitting.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II critically examines literature data on the Pu 3+∣∣Pu system. Sections IV.A and IV.B, respectively, deal with cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry measurements on PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt carried out in our laboratory. In Sec. IV.D we finally carry out statistical data analysis of experimental data and arrive at expressions for E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3. Section V presents conclusions of the work described in this paper.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
II.A. Work of Campbell and Leary
Electromotive force measurements on the Pu 3+∣∣Pu couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt was first reported by Campbell and Leary.6 The temperature range of the measurement was 686 to 730 K and xPuCl3 was varied from 5.94 × 10 −4 to 2.147 × 10 −2. The authors used Ag +|Ag as the reference electrode with xAgCl = 5.68 × 10 −4. They established the following expressions for the thermal emf of the Ta versus Ag and graphite versus Ag electrode by immersing the electrodes in molten Zn:
EAg+|AgTa(V)=2.311×10−3−6.496×10−6T(K)(1)
and
EAg+|AgGraphite(V)=7.871×10−3−1.472×10−5T(K).(2)
Campbell and Leary used the method of Laitinen et al.10 for purifying LiCl-KCl eutectic melt that involved vacuum drying of the salt mixture at 200ºC for 1 week, vacuum breaking by introducing HCl and bubbling it through the salt as the temperature was gradually increased up to the melting point of melt and alternately bubbling argon under vacuum, and finally filtering the melt through a Pyrex filter and sealing it in a Pyrex capsule.
The authors also investigated liquid junction potentials over the composition range studied and compared them with calculated values obtained from the theoretical expression for liquid junction potential and transport numbers, and found them to be 5.3 and 0.09 mV at xPuCl3 of 2.147 × 10 −2 and 0.0594×10 −2, respectively. The estimated E∘Pu3+|Pu versus T and E∘Ag+|Ag versus T were given by
E∘Pu3+|Pu(versusAg+|Ag)(V)=2.19−1.004×10−3T(K)(3)
and
E∘AgCl(versusCl−|Cl2)(V)=1.050+3.38×10−4T(K).(4)
The temperature dependence of ΔfG∘PuCl3 was reported as
ΔfG∘PuCl3(J/mol)=−937216+192T(K).(5)
II.B. Work of Nissen
Nissen investigated the reduction behavior of Pu 3+ in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt in the temperature range 673 to 873 K using chronopotentiometry.11 The LiCl-KCl eutectic melt was purified by prolonged treatment with HCl and preelectrolysis at −1.9 V (versus Ag +|Ag), leading to a residual transition time of 0.01 s at −1.9 V. Melt was contained in a graphite crucible that also served as a counter electrode. Ag +|Ag with xAgCl = 1.80 × 10 −4 was used as a reference electrode. Tungsten was used as a working electrode. Helium passed over zirconium turnings at 750°C and then through Mg(ClO4)2 was used as cover gas for the quartz cell.
The diffusion coefficient of Pu 3+ in the temperature 673 to 873 K and composition range 1.65 × 10 −5 to 3.44 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 was estimated to be in the range 0.51 × 10 −5 to 1.21 × 10 −5 cm 2·s −1. The author conjectured that at 673 K plutonium in the form of a complex, directly reduced to metal whereas at temperatures higher than 673 K, an equilibrium existed between two complex species of plutonium. In this work, E∘Pu3+|Pu and ΔfG∘PuCl3 were not estimated.
II.C. Work of Martinot and Duyckaerts
Martinot and Duyckaerts carried out investigations on reduction of Pu 4+ to Pu 3+ in the temperature range 673 to 923 K using chronopotentiometry.12,13 In their first paper, a platinum foil of 4 cm 2 area was used as the reference electrode and Pu 4+ was added into eutectic melt as Cs2PuCl6 with xPu4+ = 31.93 × 10 −3. In the temperature range 673 to 923 K, the diffusion coefficient of Pu 4+ was calculated in the range (4.2 ± 0.2) × 10 −6 to (30.0 ± 0.5) × 10 −6 cm 2·s −1. In their second paper, the Ag +|Ag couple with xAgCl = 2 × 10 −3 was used as the reference electrode and xPuCl3 was varied from 9 × 10 −4 to 32 × 10 −4. The diffusion coefficient of Pu 3+ was calculated in the range (4.8 ± 0.6) × 10 −6 to (27.6 ± 0.5) × 10 −6 cm 2·s −1 in the temperature range 673 to 923 K.
Martinot and Duyckaerts also evaluated the standard electrode potential of the Pu 3+∣∣Pu couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt in the temperature range 673 to 873 K (Ref. 14). Ag +|Ag with xAgCl = 2×10 −3 was chosen as the reference electrode. log10Pu3+(Ag+)3 was varied from 4.98 to 6.45, which corresponded to xPuCl3 = 7.64 × 10 −4 to 2.25 × 10 −2. E∘Pu3+|Pu varied from −2.062 at 673 K to −1.880 V at 873 K. The temperature dependence of ΔfG∘PuCl3 was given by the following expressions:
400∘Cto450 ∘C:ΔfG∘PuCl3(J/mol)=−810859+318T,(6)
500∘C  to  550∘C:ΔfG∘PuCl3(J/mol)  =−730108+209T  ,(7)
and
550∘Cto600 ∘C:ΔfG∘PuCl3(J/mol)=−784500+276T.(8)
Martinot also investigated the thermodynamic properties of PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt where the method of Knacke et al. was used for estimating γPuCl3 in very dilute solutions where Henry’s law was obeyed and where they referred to the activity coefficient at infinite dilution.15,16 The composition of AgCl used in the reference electrode was the same as mentioned above (2×10−3). They established the following expressions for ΔfG∘PuCl3,liq. and ΔfG∘PuCl3 in their work:
ΔfG∘PuCl3,liq.(J/mol)=−1427300+175T(K).(9)
and
ΔfG
∘
PuCl3
(J/mol)=−801800+308T(K).(10)
The activity coefficient of PuCl3(liq.) and PuCl3(s) at infinite dilution were, respectively, given by
lnγPuCl3,liq.=4900T+7.2(11)
and
lnγPuCl3,s=7800T+3.9.(12)
II.D. Work of Roy et al.
The experimental work of Roy et al. on emf measurements of actinides and lanthanides in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt is the most extensive measurements carried out in the last 30 years.17,18 These measurements were taken up as part of the Transuranic Management by Pyropartitioning Separation project for determining thermodynamic properties, such as EMCln∘, ΔfGMCln∘, and γMCln, and the distribution coefficient of actinides and rare earths in Cd and Bi (relative to Nd) of U, Np, Pu, Am, Y, La, Ce, Pr, and Gd in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt in the temperature range 673 to 773 K (Refs. 19 through 23). This project was aimed at developing pyropartioning methods for the recovery of actinides from PUREX waste.
For the Pu 3+|Pu system, the composition of PuCl3 was varied from xPuCl3 = 1.91 × 10 −5 to 1.58 × 10 −3 and measurements were carried out in the temperature range 673 to 773 K. Ag +|Ag with xAgCl = 4.87 × 10 −3 was used as the reference electrode and EAgCl∘ was taken from Yang and Hudson,24,25 which is given by
EAgCl∘versusCl−|Cl2(V)=−1.0910+2.924×10−4T(K).(13)
The curve fitting of emf data was carried out using both linear least-squares fitting and the downhill simplex method. In the curve fitting method,
EPu3+|Pueq+EAgCl∘+RTFlnxAgCl
was plotted against lnxPuCl3 at any given temperature T and extrapolated to xPuCl3 = 1 to obtain EPu3+|Pu∘. The temperature dependence of ΔfGPuCl3∘ was given by
ΔfGPuCl3∘(kJ/mol)=−960.6+0.2039T(K).(14)
The authors also estimated γPuCl3 using the following relation:
RTlnγPuCl3=ΔfGPuCl3∘−ΔfGPuCl3,liq.∘.(15)
It was estimated to be in the range 1.0 × 10 −3 to 4.1 × 10 −3 in the temperature range 673 to 773 K.
II.E. Work of Shirai et al.
Electrochemical studies by Shirai et al. on the Pu 3+|Pu system in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt pertained to cyclic voltammetric and chronopotentiometric measurements at solid molybdenum electrode and Bi electrode to estimate EPu3+|Pu∘ (versus Cl −|Cl2), ΔfGPuCl3°, EPu3+|Pu−Bi, and ΔfGPuBi2 (Refs. 26 and 27). In their first report,26 they investigated the redox behavior of U 4+|U, U 3+|U, and Pu 3+|Pu couples at molybdenum electrode in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt at temperatures of 723, 773, and 823 K. xAgCl = 3.90 × 10 −3 and xPuCl3 = 8.77 × 10 −4 and 1.62 × 10 −3 were compositions for the Ag +|Ag reference electrode and that of PuCl3, respectively. The authors mentioned that there were two redox couples, one corresponding to the Pu 3+|Pu couple, which was quasireversible in nature, and the other appearing at 610, 420, and 420 mV more anodic potentials at 723, 773, and 823 K, respectively, due to either the phase transition of Pu during electrodeposition or the underpotential deposition of Pu due to interaction with electrode material.
In their second report on the Pu 3+|Pu system,27 they chose the same composition of Ag +|Ag reference electrode as in their earlier work. xPuCl3 and the temperature range of measurement were 7.40 × 10 −4 to 1.40 × 10 −3 and 723 to 823 K, respectively. Apart from measuring the transient time of Pu 3+|Pu from chronopotentiometric transients and DPu3+|Pu, the temperature dependence of EPu3+|Pu∘ was given by
EPu3+|Pu∘versusAg+|Ag(V)=−2.232+9.4×10−4T(K).(16)
EAg+|Ag∘ was derived from Yang and Hudson data24,25 and is given by
EAgCl∘versusCl−|Cl2(V)=−1.0659−1.805×10−4T(K).(17)
The temperature dependence of ΔfGPuCl3∘ was given by
ΔfGPuCl3∘(kJ/mol)=−646.1+0.027T(K).(18)
II.F. Work of Sakamura et al.
Sakamura et al. studied the thermodynamics of plutonium and americium distribution between LiCl-KCl eutectic melt and cadmium to estimate the activity coefficient of plutonium in cadmium and the separation factor of americium relative to plutonium.28 For electrochemical measurements, xAgCl = 3.90 × 10 −3 was chosen as the composition of the reference electrode and was calibrated against Li-Al electrode before emf measurements. The authors used both Pyrex and Vycor sheaths for the Ag +|Ag reference electrodes. The former was used for estimating EPu3+|Pu∘ and the latter was used for distribution experiments. Potential temperature relationship for both types of reference electrodes were given by
EAg(Pyrex)versusLi−Al(V)=2.552−5.41×10−4T(K)(19)
and
EAg(Vycor)versusLi−Al(V)=2.538−5.36×10−4T(K).(20)
The EPu3+|Pueq of plutonium deposited at tantalum electrode was measured against the Ag +|Ag reference in the temperature range 673 to 773 K. xPuCl3 was estimated from constant current electrolysis curves at different temperatures and was found to be 2.9 × 10 −4, 6.6 × 10 −4, 1.17 × 10 −3, 1.70 × 10 −3, and 2.35 × 10 −3. The temperature dependence of EPu3+|Pu∘ was given by
EPu3+|Pu∘versusAg+|Ag(V)=−2.204+8.45×10−4T.(21)
II.G. Work of Serp et al. and Masset et al.
Electrochemical investigations at the Institute for Transuranium Elements in Karlsruhe, Germany, as a part of the Pyrometallurgical Processing Research Program, were initiated for the estimation of electrochemical properties of actinides and lanthanides in fluoride (LiF-NaF, LiF, CaF2, and FLiNaK) and chloride (LiCl-KCl eutectic) melts.29 The electrorefining of unirradiated U-20Pu-10Zr (in weight percent) alloy was also carried out in collaboration with the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry30 of Japan as a part of this project. Serp et al.31 also investigated the redox behavior of plutonium in the temperature range 733 to 823 K using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and semi-integral methods.31
In their experimental studies, xAgCl = 3.90 × 10 −3 and xPuCl3 = 1.662 × 10 −3 and 3.03 × 10 −3 were used, and the temperature range was 733 to 823 K. For 8.3 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3, they estimated the diffusion coefficient of Pu 3+ in the range 1.5 × 10 −5 to 1.85 × 10 −5 cm 2·s −1 at 733 K. For 1.2 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3, there was closer agreement in diffusion coefficient values by semi-integral and chronopotentiometry techniques (1.65 × 10 −5 and 1.7 × 10 −5 cm 2·s −1 at 733 K). They estimated EPu3+|Pu∗∘ by logarithmic analysis of semi-integral and chronopotentiometric curves, and the same was used in the present work as well, as described in Sec. IV.C. ΔfGPuCl3∞ at infinite dilution was given by
ΔfGPuCl3∞(kJ/mol)=−956.6+0.200T(K).(22)
Based on the evaluation and analysis of thermochemical data, they arrived at the following estimates for PuCl3:
S∘(PuCl3,cr,298.15K)=161.4±3.0(JK−1mol−1),(23)(23)
Cp(PuCl3,cr,T)=91.412+37.16×10−3T+0.274×105T−2(JK−1mol−1),                      (24)
Cp(PuCl3,liq.,T)=144(JK−1mol−1),(25)
and
ΔfusH(PuCl3)=49±3(kJmol−1).(26)
γPuCl3 was estimated at 9.5 × 10 −3, 12 × 10 −3, and 16 × 10 −3 at 733, 773, and 823 K, respectively.
Konings et al.32 and Masset et al.33 also carried out thermochemical evaluations of actinide and lanthanide chlorides in which thermodynamic properties such as ΔfH°, S∘, Cp, Tfus., ΔfusH, and Cp(liq.) were estimated and compiled.
II.H. Work of Tylka et al.
Tylka et al. examined the applicability of electrochemical techniques for quantitative estimation of actinides in molten salts in pyroprocessing.34,35 As a part of their work, they explored the suitableness of cyclic voltammetry for estimating actinides over a wider composition range, and their studies concluded that up to 2 wt%, electrochemical measurements could be used precisely, but beyond this concentration the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient could be an influencing factor. In their first work,34 they discussed the selection criteria for developing the electrochemical method for ensuring repeatable measurements and they discussed aspects of sensitivity and precision using methods such as cyclic voltammetry, square-wave voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, open-circuit chronopotentiometry, and sampled-current voltammetry. The authors used cyclic voltammetry and obtained linear correlations of current against immersion depth of working electrode. In their second work,35 they extended their earlier work to the estimation of concentration of U 3+ and Pu 3+ in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt using cyclic voltammetry and also developed a semidifferential method for resolving problems due to zero-current baseline for multicomponent systems.
Tylka et al. also investigated nucleation and growth mechanism of uranium and plutonium in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt using current-time transients and determined the rate of nucleation and size of nuclei from the transients.36 They also determined the diffusion coefficients of U 3+ and Pu 3+ and compared them with literature data where the agreement was found to be good. In these works, EPu3+|Pu∘ was not estimated.
II.I. Summary and Analysis of Literature Data
In order to bring all literature data measured by either emf or either cyclic voltammetry or chronopotentiometry methods to a common reference standard, we have recalculated EPu3+|Pu∘ by choosing EAgCl∘ given by Eq. (13), which was used by Roy et al.,17,18 Serp et al.,31 and Masset et al.37 for estimating ΔfGPuCl3∘. This expression is universally used for rescaling equilibrium potential data measured against Ag +|Ag to Cl −|Cl2.
Recently, Yoon et al. measured the equilibrium potential of Ag +|Ag versus Cl −|Cl 2 reference at various xAgCl in the temperature range 723 to 823 K (Ref. 38). xAgCl was varied from 3.9 × 10 −4 to 0.1. In their work, the authors first compared the EAgCl∘ used by various research groups based on extrapolation of data from Yang and Hudson,24,25 and they argued that some extrapolations could be erroneous as the lowest xAgCl used by Yang and Hudson was 0.0146. Based on variation of EAgCl (versus Cl −|Cl2) versus lnxAgCl at different temperatures, Yoon et al. obtained correlations based on linear least-squares fitting. The average correlation for estimating EAgCl was reported as
EAgCl(V)=−(0.8726±0.00486)+(0.05896±0.00108)lnxAgCl.(27)
For recalculating EPu3+|Pu∘ using Yoon et al. data, the EAgCl for specific xAgCl used by various authors was estimated from temperature-specific correlations of EAgCl versus lnxAgCl (Ref. 38). The calculated potentials were subsequently fitted against temperature to obtain temperature-dependent correlation for EAgCl for specific xAgCl. This expression was helpful in cases where EAgCl for specific xAgCl could be calculated at temperatures other than what the authors used for their measurements. For example, emf data measured by Campbell and Leary are graphically shown in Fig. 1. It was observed that data measured at 710 K at various xPuCl3 only could be fitted to estimate EPu3+|Pu∘. Using EAgCl∘ by Yang and Hudson, Eeq+EAgCl∘+RTFlnxAgCl was linear least-squares fitted against lnxPuCl3 (method of Roy et al.17,18) to obtain EPuCl3∘ at 710 K. Using the data of Yoon et al., the following equation of EAgCl for xAgCl = 5.68 × 10 −4 used by Campbell and Leary was established:
EAgCl(V)=−(1.045±0.018)−(3.347±0.229)×10−4T(K).(28)
Fig. 1. The emf data of Pu 3+|Pu couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt as a function of lnxPuCl3 (from Campbell and Leary6).
Subsequently, EPu3+|Pueq+EAgCl was linear least-squares fitted against lnxPuCl3 to obtain EPu3+|Pu∘ at 710 K. A similar procedure was adopted in other cases as well.
As described above, the emf data of Martinot and Duyckaerts14 and Sakamura et al.28 and the voltammetric data of Shirai et al.27 were used for recalculating EPu3+|Pu∘ at respective temperature ranges using the data of Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38 In so far as the emf data of Roy et al. are concerned, they estimated EPu3+|Pu∘ using the EAgCl∘ of Yang and Hudson.24,25 They were recalculated using the data of Yoon et al.38 An overall summary of the experimental work on the measurement of EPu3+|Pu∘ by Campbell and Leary,6 Martinot et al.,14 Roy et al.,17 Shirai et al.,27 Sakamura et al.,28 and Serp et al.29,37,39 is presented in Table I. The temperature dependence of EAgCl for respective xAgCl estimated from the Yoon et al. data is also presented in Table I.
TABLE I Literature Survey of Experimental Conditions and Techniques Adopted for Estimating EPu3+|Pu∘ and ΔfGPuCl3° in LiCl-KCl Eutectic Melt
The variation of EPu3+|Pueq+EAgCl∘+RTFlnxAgCl against lnxPuCl3 and EPu3+|Pueq+EAgCl against lnxPuCl3 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. There are two bands of literature data as seen from Figs. 2 and 3. The first band at lower potentials (from −1.95 to −2.18 V) corresponds to the data of Martinot et al.,14 and the second band (from −2.7 to −3.00 V) corresponds to the data of Campbell and Leary,6 Roy et al.,17 Shirai et al.,27 Sakamura et al.,28 and Serp et al.31 These data sets agree quite well with each other although few measurements were carried out by the emf method and others by transient techniques. Martinot et al.’s data, as we will later discuss, is probably erroneous as the estimated data are lower than that of the U 3+|U couple reported by Martinot and coworkers.40–43 They reported in a series of papers the electrochemistry of U 4+|U 3+ and U 3+|U couples in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt. They reported EU3+|U∘ of −2.598, −2.557, −2.527, and −2.489 V at 673, 723, 773, and 823 K, respectively. These values are about 500 mV more cathodic than that reported for the Pu 3+|Pu couple by the same authors, as is shown later. This is in conflict with the current understanding of the stability of UCl3 and PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt.

The EPu3+|Pu∘ from Figs. 2 and 3 was estimated using the method of Roy et al.17,18 A comparison of EPu3+|Pu∘ reported in literature and corresponding recalculated values using the data of Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38 and adopting the Roy et al. method17,18 are shown in Table II. It is clearly seen that variation in EPu3+|Pu∘ estimated using the Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38 data is within 1.7% for the Campbell and Leary data,6 2% for the Martinot et al. data, and 1.3% in the remaining cases. Both Eq. (13) and correlations by Yoon et al. are therefore similar in representation although there is a systematic variation of ≈35 mV in the estimation of EPu3+|Pu∘ by Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38

III. EXPERIMENTAL
At the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research, development of pyrochemical reprocessing of metal alloy fuels is being pursued both in laboratory scale using U-Pu-Zr alloy (in 20-g per batch) and in engineering scale using uranium-based alloys (1-kg per batch).44–47
III.A. Inert Atmosphere Glove Box for Pyroprocessing Studies
An argon atmosphere glove box train was commissioned for carrying out electrochemical measurements on plutonium-bearing systems. The train consists of two 2 m 3 double-module glove boxes interconnected with each other and having common feed and bleed, pneumatic pressure control, and argon recirculation systems. It has a bag-in/bag-out port for the transfer of materials into and out of the glove box. The sealing unit (impulse sealing machine, Thimonnier, France) is used for thermal sealing of the polyvinyl chloride bag during bag-in/out operation.
Glove box pressure is maintained between 20 and 40 mm of water column (negative with respect to ambient) that is monitored and controlled using a photohelic gauge and solenoid valves. Sampling of argon from the glove box is carried out by placing a sampling pump inside the glove box and connecting it to gas sampling lines through HEPA filter casings. Oxygen and moisture levels in the glove box train are analyzed by a trace oxygen and dew point analyzer (Nucon Engineers, New Delhi) connected to the above sampling line. All operations inside the glove box train are carried out using 6-in. ambidextrous butyl-rubber gauntlets.48
III.B. Preparation of Electrolytes and Electrodes
Anhydrous LiCl (Sigma-Aldrich) and KCl (Sigma-Aldrich) were homogeneously mixed in eutectic ratio (58.5:41.5 mol %), vacuum dried at 150°C for 120 h, and then chlorinated at 500°C for about 1 h. The batch size of the LiCl-KCl eutectic mixture taken for chlorination was about 100 to 150 g. The eutectic melt, after chlorination, was cooled under argon and stored as molds in the glove box. About 400 g of LiCl-KCl eutectic melt was prepared for electrochemical measurements on PuCl3. The LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 electrolyte was prepared by equilibrating metallic plutonium with CdCl2 (anhydrous, Alfa-Aesar) at 500°C under constant stirring. The composition of plutonium in melt was estimated by potentiometric titration and found to be xPuCl3 = 3.22 × 10 −3 (Ref. 49). From the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) described in Sec. III.C, the absence of Cd 2+ ions in melt was confirmed.
Ag +|Ag with xAgCl = 3.90 × 10 −3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt was used as the reference electrode. The design and construction of the Ag +|Ag electrode is described elsewhere.50 High-density graphite (vacuum dried at 500°C prior to use) with a diameter of 8 mm and height of 50 mm was used as the counter electrode. For the experiments described here, tantalum wire (1.5 mm in diameter) was used as the working electrode. The surface of the electrode wire was cleaned with sandpaper before exposing it to melt. The immersion depth of the working electrode was estimated from the difference in outside height of the working electrode when it was completely immersed and when it was just above the surface of melt, and was either carried out by checking electrical continuity between the counter electrode and working electrode or by simply checking the open-circuit potential or residual current in the cell from the potentiostat. Based on the immersion depth of the electrode in melt, the electrode area was calculated and found to be 0.30 cm 2.
III.C. Cell Assembly and Procedure
The electrochemical cell assembly consisted of an outer vessel (Inconel 600) attached to the floor of the glove box. A high-temperature, split-type furnace was placed around the outer vessel, and in order to avoid any heat losses, the top annular gap of the furnace was packed with a ceramic blanket wool. The inner vessel consisted of a SS430 bottom vessel and top flange having SS304 and polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon Veeco couplings. Veeco couplings were used to position the electrodes and thermocouple (K-type, sheathed with alumina thermowell) for immersing them into the melt without any electrical shorting. The temperature of the melt and potentials of electrodes against the Ag +|Ag reference electrode were monitored using an Agilent 34970A data acquisition system. The electrochemical vessel was loaded with LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 electrolyte contained in an SS430 crucible that was kept in a stainless steel support structure with a pyrophyllite platform at the bottom to ensure complete electrical isolation from the vessel and support structure. About 200 to 300 g of high-purity cadmium was also loaded in the SS430 crucible. Care was taken to avoid immersing the electrodes and thermocouple into the cadmium pool. The furnace was heated to the desired temperature such that the melt temperature was maintained at 450°C and 500°C. Uncertainty in the temperature measurement was ±2°C. Signal cables from the working, reference, and counter electrodes were attached to prelabeled Teflon electrical cables soldered to electrical feedthroughs. For all electrochemical measurements, an AUTOLAB 302N PGSTAT equipped with IF030 interface was used. Data acquisition and processing were carried out using the GPES software module.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
IV.A. Cyclic Voltammetry
Cyclic voltammograms of LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 melt at 723 K recorded at tantalum as working electrode in the potential range −0.50 to −1.96 V and the scan rate range 25 to 125 mV/s are shown in Fig. 4. Similar CVs were recorded at 773 K as well. As seen from voltammograms, there is finite residual cathodic current density in the potential range −0.80 to −1.60 V varying from 6 mA·cm −2 at 25 mV/s to 15 mA·cm −2 at 125 mV/s. The cathodic peak, the onset of which varies from −1.716 to −1.698 V from 25 to 125 mV/s, corresponds to the Pu 3+|Pu couple, which is similar in nature to that described in literature.26,27,29,31,37 In the CVs reported by Shirai et al.,26 they observed two redox couples. The first redox couple for which the cathodic peak potential appeared in potential range −1.5 to −1.75 V and the corresponding anodic peak appearing in the potential range −1.0 to −1.2 V was explained on the basis of the underpotential deposition of plutonium due to alloy formation of Pu with the electrode material, phase transition in Pu during deposition, or formation of some other complexes of Pu. In the voltammograms shown in Fig. 4 there were no features of the underpotential deposition of Pu. In another paper by Shirai et al.,27 they reported the CV of PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt, where they observed a redox couple at slightly higher anodic potentials (cathodic and anodic peak at −1.6 and −1.0 V, respectively) that they attributed to the influence of crystallization overvoltage on Pu deposition leading to the formation of strongly adhered crystalline deposit at Mo working electrode, which dissolves at higher anodic potentials i.e., at −1.0 V.
In CVs reported by Serp et al.,31 the underpotential deposition of Pu for 1.0 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt at tungsten working electrode was also observed. In anodic sweep, there were two peaks observed that corresponded to the redissolution of Pu deposited in the cathodic sweep and the desorption of Pu appearing at higher anodic potentials. These features were not observed in CVs recorded for 8.3 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3. The current density of the anodic dissolution peak of Pu in CVs reported by Serp et al. varied from 25 mA·cm −2 for 1.0 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3, whereas it was 275 mA·cm −2 for 8.3 × 10 −5 mol·cm −3 PuCl3, an elevenfold increase in current density for an eightfold increase in the composition of PuCl3. This could have led to masking of the adsorption peak at higher anodic potentials.
In the CVs discussed in this paper, there were no features observed as described by Shirai et al.26,27 and Serp et al.31 The composition of PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt used in our work (2.25 × 10 −4 mol·cm −3) was higher than those chosen in earlier works, although it was not our aim to confirm or dispute the observations recorded by Shirai et al. and Serp et al.31
The semi-integral voltammograms of PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt at 723 K for scan rates of 25 to 200 mV/s are shown in Fig. 5, which is based on the method developed by Imbeaux and Saveant51 and Oldham and coworkers,52–55 and on following convolution integral:
m=d−1/2dt−1/2i(t)=1π1/2∫0ti(u)(t−u)1/2du,(29)
Fig. 5. Semi-integral curves of CVs of PuCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt: T = 723 K; WE (Ta) area = 0.30 cm 2.
which computes m-t curves from experimental i-t profiles. The limiting value of m, denoted by m∗, is given by the expression
m∗=3FACPu3+DPu3+.(30)
The semi-integral curves in Fig. 5 are similar to those obtained by Serp et al.,31 except that the forward and reverse sweeps do not quite overlap, probably because of finite residual cathodic current density in the potential range −0.80 to −1.60 V as mentioned above.
IV.B. Chronopotentiometry
Chronopotentiograms (CPs) recorded at various applied cathodic current densities in LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 melt at 773 K are shown in Fig. 6. They are also seen to be similar to those obtained by Serp et al. except that in the present case, the applied cathodic current density varies from −33.3 to −233.3 mA·cm −2, whereas in the Serp et al. report, the current density varied from −75 to −175 mA·cm −2. Further, the variation of applied cathodic current (in the current density range −100 to −166.67 mA·cm −2) density versus τ−1/2 yielded a straight line confirming the diffusion controlled nature of the Pu 3+|Pu couple in eutectic melt. (Please refer to the Acknowledgment section for information on supplemental data.)

IV.C. Estimation of Apparent Standard Electrode Potential EPu3+|Pu∗∘
For a pure Nernstian redox couple involving an insoluble deposit, in this case Pu, logarithmic analysis of semi-integral curves can be used for estimating EPu3+|Pu∘, and is given by
E=EPu3+|Pu∘+RT3FlnaPuCl3meltaPucathode+RT3Flnm∗−mm∗.（31)
In a similar manner, logarithmic analysis of reversible CPs for soluble-insoluble couple is given by56
E=EPu3+|Pu∘+RT3FlnaPuCl3melt+RT3Flnτ−tτ.(32)
Since EPu3+|Pu∘ is estimated employing a transient technique, which in the strictest sense is not an equilibrium technique similar to emf measurement, it is related to apparent standard electrode potential given by
EPu3+|Pu∗∘=EPu3+|Pu∘+RT3FlnγPuCl3melt,(33)
where γPuCl3melt=aPuCl3meltxPuCl3, and where Eqs. (31) and (32) can be modified, respectively, to
E=EPu3+|Pu∗∘+RT3FlnxPuCl3+RT3Flnm∗−mm∗(34)
and
E=EPu3+|Pu∗∘+RT3FlnxPuCl3+RT3Flnτ−tτ.(35)
The variation of E against lnm∗−mm∗ (at 723 K) and lnτ1/2−t1/2τ1/2 (at 773 K) are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. The logarithmic analysis of the semi-integral curves for voltammograms recorded at 773 K was similar to Fig. 7; please refer to Acknowledgment section for information on supplemental data. Table III shows EPu3+|Pu∗∘ estimated from CV and CP measurements at various scan rates (up to 200 mV/s) and applied cathodic current densities, respectively. The transition times τ from CPs are also listed in Table III. Equation (13) and the correlations of Yoon et al.38 were used for estimating EPu3+|Pu∗∘. For xAgCl = 3.9 × 10 −3 used in the present work, the temperature dependence of EAgCl using Yoon et al. data is given by
EAgCl(V)=−(1.039±0.011)=(2.072±0.145)T(K).(36)
As seen from Table III, EPu3+|Pu∗∘ at 723 K [calculated using Eq. (34)] varies from −2.902 to −2.937 V in the scan rate range 25 to 200 mV/s whereas at 773 K, it varies from −2.822 to −2.916 V in the same scan rate range using the EAgCl∘ of Yang and Hudson.24,25 On the other hand, it varies from −2.866 to −2.901 V at 723 K and from −2.787 to −2.881 V at 773 K using the Yoon et al. data.38 It is also seen that at higher scan rates there is a significant cathodic shift in calculated EPu3+|Pu∗∘. Therefore, the average EPu3+|Pu∗∘ versus Cl −|Cl2 at 723 and 773 K was estimated from the scan rates of 25 and 50 mV/s using both reference electrode correlations, and it was found to be −2.888 ± 0.021 and −2.810 ± 0.021 V, respectively. Using Eq. (35), EPu3+|Pu∗∘ varies from −2.862 to −2.898 V and −2.827 to −2.863 V in the current density range of 100 to 200 mA·cm −2 calculated using Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.,38 respectively. The variation in EPu3+|Pu∘ was within 1.3%. EPu3+|Pu∗∘ versus Cl −|Cl2 and was estimated from values obtained at current densities in the range −100 to −150 mA·cm −2. Using both reference electrode correlations it was found to be −2.851 ± 0.020 V.

IV.D. Recommendations on EPu3+|Pu∘ and ΔfGPuCl3∘
The recalculated EPu3+|Pu∘ values from Campbell and Leary,6 Martinot and Duyckaerts,14 Shirai et al.,27 and Sakamura et al.28; the data of Roy et al.17 and Serp et al.31; and those estimated in the present work at 723 and 773 K are shown in Fig. 9. There is very good agreement among all data sets but for those by Martinot and Duyckaerts, the reasons for which are clearly not known.14 Martinot and Duyckaerts had reported EPu3+|Pueq versus Ag +|Ag to be in the range −1.127 to −1.010 V in the temperature range of 673 to 873 K, and corresponding EPu3+|Pu∘ were about 800 mV lower than those calculated from the works of Campbell and Leary,6 Shirai et al.,27 Sakamura et al.,28 Roy et al.,17 and Serp et al.31 Martinot and Duyckaerts used the following equation by Knacke et al. for estimating EPu3+|Pu∘ (Ref. 16):
ΔfGAgCl∘(J/mol)=−105200+29.0T(K).(37)
Fig. 9. Comparison of EPu3+|Pu∘ from literature [reestimated using Eq. (13) by Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38] and that estimated in the present work. Linear least-squares fit (present work) and CALPHAD estimation of Zhou and Zhang57 are also compared.
EAgCl∘ is −865 and −858 mV at 773 K using Eqs. (13) and (37), respectively. In the temperature range 673 to 823 K, the difference in the two estimations is within 6.3 to 7.9 mV. Therefore, there could not have been any error in the estimations of Martinot and Duyckaerts due to uncertainties in Eq. (37). It is quite clear from Table II that either the use of EAgCl∘ by Yang and Hudson24,25 or EAgCl by Yoon et al.38 did not lead to a reliable estimation of EPu3+|Pu∘. Due to the above reasons, Martinot and Duyckaerts’s data were not used for subsequent data fitting.
The EPu3+|Pu∘ obtained by emf and either CV or CP methods using both the Ag +|Ag reference electrode data of Yang and Hudson24,25 and Yoon et al.38 were given equal weightage in least-squares fitting, and the following temperature dependence of EPu3+|Pu∘ was established:
EPu3+|Pu∘versusCl−|Cl2(V)=−(3.325±0.117)+(7.212±1.571)×10−4T(K).(38)
Figure 9 shows a comparison of experimental data and linear least-squares fit [Eq. (38)]. Mean squares and mean squares of error were 0.03503 and 0.00166, respectively, with a residual sum of squares of 0.05987. The F-statistic, which is the ratio of mean squares and mean squares of error was 21.064. Fit residuals are shown in Fig. 10. Such variations in fit residuals are expected in statistical data fitting of different data sets measured under different experimental conditions, and more so when they are normalized by taking a common reference potential (EAgCl∘ and EAgCl in this case) to numerically compare them. The corresponding temperature dependence of ΔfGPuCl3∘ is given by
ΔfGPuCl3∘(J/mol)=−(962738±33982)+(208.8±45.5)T(K).(39)
Fig. 10. Fit residuals of linear least-squares fit of EPu3+|Pu∘ versus T (shown in Fig. 9).
The EPu3+|Pu∘ arrived at by the CALPHAD method by Zhou and Zhang57 is given by
EPu3+|Pu∘versusCl−|Cl2(V)=−3.4727+7.058×10−4T(K).(40)
Equations (38) and (40) are also compared in Fig. 9. It is observed that the CALPHAD estimation [Eq. (40)] is slightly overestimated from that expressed by Eq. (38) as estimated in our work. The authors understand that both Eqs. (38) and (40) are consistent with each other and that the marginal difference is due to the fact that Eq. (40) was estimated from thermodynamic optimization of experimental data where not only emf data but also enthalpy of mixing data were used. The overemphasis of the thermochemical data and the lack of phase transition data of ternary LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 system is one of the reasons for the overestimation in EPu3+|Pu∘. Figure 9 also shows that the data of Martinot and Duyckaerts,14 as discussed above, are associated with some systematic errors. In order to calculate γPuCl3, we consider the following reaction:
Pu(s)+32Cl2(g)→PuCl3(liq.).（41)
ΔfGPuCl3,liq.∘ in the temperature range 673 to 873 K was calculated for the reaction in Eq. (41) using FactSage 6.4 (Ref. 58) and was least-squares fitted to the following expression:
ΔfGPuCl3,liq.∘(J/mol)=−(892784±78)+(155.516±0.103)T.(42)
Using Eq. (15), γPuCl3 was estimated and is given by
RTlnγPuCl3(J/mol)=−69954+53.284T(K).(43)
Based on Eq. (43), γPuCl3 (in hypothetically supercooled liquid as reference state) varies from 2.26 × 10 −3 to 2.21 × 10 −2 in the temperature range 673 to 823 K. The estimated values are reasonably close to those estimated by Serp et al. (Sec. II.G). They also estimated γPuCl3 to be in the range 3.5 × 10 −3 to 7.9 × 10 −3 in the temperature range 733 to 823 K using the thermochemical data of Lemire et al.,59 and these values were closer to those estimated in our work.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have carried out thermochemical evaluation of EPu3+|Pu∘ and ΔfGPuCl3∘ in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt in the present work. It is seen from literature data published during the period 1966 to 2005 that a variety of experimental conditions were employed to investigate the Pu 3+|Pu system in eutectic melt. It was established in the present work that data obtained by emf measurements and transient techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry, employed for determining EPu3+|Pu∘ agreed quite well with each other, but for the data by Martinot and Duyckaerts.14 The method of Roy et al.,17,18 the EAgCl∘ by Yang and Hudson,24,25 and the Ag +|Ag reference electrode correlations by Yoon et al.38 were used for reestimating EPu3+|Pu∘ from the works of Campbell and Leary,6 Shirai et al.,27 Roy et al.,17 and Sakamura et al.28 The maximum variation in the two estimations was found to be 2%. This report also validates Ag +|Ag reference electrode correlations recently established by Yoon et al.38 It remains to be seen if these could be further confirmed using other redox couples in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt. We recommend Eqs. (38) and (39) for EPu3+|Pu∘ and ΔfGPuCl3∘, respectively. EPu3+|Pu∘ estimated in the present work can be considered more accurate than that estimated by the CALPHAD methodology57 since the latter method could be associated with some uncertainties due to the overdependence of enthalpy of mixing data used in thermodynamic optimization. γPuCl3 was found to be in the range of 9.8 × 10 −4 to 1.8 × 10 −2 in the temperature range of 673 to 823 K. The estimated γPuCl3 in the present work can be considered reliable keeping in mind uncertainties resulting from statistical data fitting procedures and various experimental conditions adopted by research groups for calculating EPu3+|Pu∘.
