Summary
Ru complexes were successfully produced, and their structural properties were investigated using FTIR, Raman, and single crystal XRD patterns. The HOMO, LUMO, Eg, and electronic surface potential (ESP) values of the molecules were calculated by a Gaussian program. The complexes were used for producing hybrid capacitor cells as electrode materials. According to electrochemical analysis, complex 2 showed the best CV graph between −1 V and +1 V and had the highest current value and hysteresis area when compared with the other complexes. The performance analysis and the capacity fade of the cells were investigated. The first capacity values of the complexes were 57.5, 22.1, 16.9, and 0.0021 F/g for complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The capacitive mechanism of the cells as relates to molecular interactions was also investigated. We suggested that the ESP values of the molecules were directly related to the capacitive performance of the cells. In addition to this, the best cycling performance was obtained for complex 2, which has the lowest Eg value among the complexes. We speculate that the charged regions on the complex materials have a crucial role in the increasing the capacitance of the cells.
1 INTRODUCTION
Portable energy storage devices have a large application in daily life. In addition to rechargeable batteries, hybrid capacitors have recently been given attention due to their high energy storage capacities. As is commonly known, electrochemical capacitors consist of electrolyte and membrane like a battery. They have been studied in the last decade, and they exhibit higher capacitance values when compared with conventional capacitors. There are two types of electrochemical capacitors: Electric double layer capacitors and pseudo-capacitors.1, 2 The electrochemical capacitors have also been referred to as hybrid capacitors, because the working principle of the cell is very similar to that of rechargeable batteries. Supercapacitors exhibit similar charge/discharge curves over 104 cycles without losing their properties2-4 and show high specific capacitance values from 10 to 1000 F/g.5, 6
The performance of electrochemical capacitors strongly depends on their surface area, electrical conductivity, and structural stability during the cycles of the cell. The most popular electrode materials for the hybrid capacitors are carbon-based materials such as graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotube, etc. due to their high electrical conductivities and surface areas.3, 7-11 However, some organic complexes have also been used for electrochromic devices, due to their surface area advantages.12 On the other hand, although there are studies in the literature for the use of organic materials in electrochromic devices, there is not much information about hybrid capacitor studies that have used organometallic complexes.
Metal-based electrode materials have been very popular in the last few years for electrochemical capacitors; Ru, Ir, Mn, Co, Fe, Pt, among others, have been used as electrode materials in capacitors.13-17 The molecular symmetry is very important for the determination of the capacity of the cells in electrode materials, because the local electrostatic interactions with the ions in electrolytes have a crucial role in the formation of the electric fields between the two electrodes in the capacitor cells. When the voltage applied to the cell, the interactions of the electrode with the cationic and anionic ions in the electrolytes lead to weak bonding on the structure. For these reasons, the electronic structures of the metal complexes whose electrochemical activities are to be investigated should be examined carefully. DFT calculation, which is one of the sensitive methods used for this subject, has been used by our group in our previous studies.18
The organometallic complexes may have higher surface areas when compared with the inorganic crystalline materials. Thus, it is a challenge to investigate the effects of the surface area and molecular interactions in the capacitor application of organometallic compounds. In addition, Ru complexes can contribute to electrochemical performance due to their ability to change the valance bands of metal ions. For this purpose, we chose four ruthenium complexes to determine the electronic structure (with DFT calculations) and the effect of the stability on the cycle performance of the cells. The organometallic complexes could have a huge potential for energy storage technologies, because the surface areas and conducting properties can be controlled by metal ions and ligands in the structure. Therefore, using organometallic complexes for energy storage application is relatively new, and the prior studies performed by our group give an insight into this field. Furthermore, our study suggests a relationship between the electronic surface potential and the capacitor performance of the devices.
2 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2.1 Materials and methods
In this study, all reactions were conducted under inert gas conditions (argon) using a well-known Schlenk process. [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 and [RuCl2(HMB)]2 were purchased and used as obtained. After production of the complexes, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300-MHz spectrometer and referenced to the residual signals of the solvent. Single crystal X-ray diffraction patterns of the complexes were measured with the D8 VENTURE Bruker AXS. The structural refinement of the complexes was performed by the least-square method based on F2 (SHELXL-2014).19, 20 During the refinement process, all nonhydrogen atoms were based on the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters, and H atoms in the structure were finally inserted to the calculated location. The last refinement process was on F2, with 5786 unique intensities and 289 parameters converged at ωR(F2) = 0.0765 (R(F) = 0.0317) for 5488 observed reflections with I > 2σ(I).
The FTIR spectra of the complexes were measured by a Perkin Elmer, Spectrum One model in the range of 400 to 4000 cm−1, and the Raman spectra of samples was measured by RIGAKU, Senterra using a 532-nm laser with 20 MW of power at DESY-Germany.
DFT optimizations of the complex were performed using the GAUSSIAN 09W21 program with the basis set of B3LYP (Becke, three parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr)/LanL2DZ (Los Alamos National Laboratory 2 Double Zeta). Excited energy levels (HOMO and LUMO), energies, and electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of complexes were calculated.
The electrochemical hybrid capacitors were produced by using a button cell case. The components of the cell were put in order of: electrode, electrolyte, membrane (cellulose), electrolyte, then electrode. The active materials for electrodes were coated on a circular titanium foil with diameter of 8 mm, and a doctor blade was used for obtaining homogenous film. The film slurry was fabricated using 90% active material, 10% PVDF, and sufficient NMP solvent, and the heat treatment was applied at 110°C to cast solvent onto electrodes. A 6 M KOH/H2O solution was selected as the electrolyte solution. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for complexes were performed by using an Ivium Octostat30 potentiostat/galvanostat, and the measurements were done with a scan rate of 200 and 400 mV/s in a two-electrode configuration. The charge/discharge profiles were measured at ±1 mA, and the capacity values of the cells were calculated with increasing cycle numbers.
2.2 Synthesis of the complexes
2.2.1 Synthesis of the NHC salts (LHX) and ruthenium-NHC complexes
The synthesis of the NHC salts (LHX) and complexes 2 and 3 and was synthesized according to related literature.22, 23 The synthesis of ruthenium complexes is shown in Scheme 1. The CCDC number of complex 4 was supplied at the Appendix section. The detailed information can be seen in the supplementary file.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Structural properties of the complexes
It is well known that complex 1 is one of the common materials for organometallic studies, and its structural and the other properties can be found in the literature.24 The detailed information about the structural properties of complexes 2 and 3 can be found in the study of Yaşar et al.22 Complex 4 was synthesized by the reaction of N-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)benzimidazole with [RuCl2(HMB)]2 (HMB: hexamethylbenzene) in toluene as solvent. The structure of complex 4 was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, X-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis. According to single crystal diffraction, the molecular structure of the complex 4 confirms the N-coordination of ruthenium metal to N(3) atom of benzimidazole ring. The proton signal of NCHN complex 4 was observed in the 1H NMR spectra at 8.21 ppm, confirming the N-coordination of ruthenium centre to nitrogen atom. The nature of the bonding in the benzimidazole complex 4 was readily shown by NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectroscopy was the most useful tool for structure elucidation. N-coordination to the metal centre results in a high field shift towards 145 to 155 ppm, while C2 coordination results in a low field shift, ie, 170 to 200 ppm.
The bond structures of the complexes were investigated by FTIR spectra, as shown in Figure 1. The complexes showed strong bands in the regions of 1446, 1386, and 1517 cm−1 due to ν N―C―N groups. It can be clearly seen from Figure 1 that the bands observed at 1446 and 1386 cm−1 in the metal complexes 2 and 3, respectively, indicate the coordination of NHC ligands to metal through carbene carbon. The band observed at 1517 cm−1 also confirms the N-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre through the nitrogen atoms. The vibrations observed at 1576 to 1560 cm−1 in the spectra of ruthenium complexes correspond to aromatic C═C bond stretching. Aromatic C―H vibrations (sp2 νC―H) bands were observed at 2965, 2960, 2970, and 2921 cm−1, respectively, for complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The structures of 1 to 4 were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The obtained spectra are presented in Figure 2 and Table 1.

Complex 2	Complex 3	Complex 4	Assignts

2952 cm−1	2940-3049 cm−1	2918-3044 cm−1	C―H stretching
The bands observed at the wavelength of 3000 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum were caused by C―H stretching, while the wavelengths of 1300 to 1500 cm−1 were caused by C═H and N―C stretching. The expansion of the ligand regions resulted in the separation of the peaks originating from the C―H and C═H bands and increased the intensity of these bands, particularly in complexes 3 and 4.
For the single crystal X-ray analysis of complex 4, suitable crystals were obtained by crystallization of the red solid of complex 4 in a dichloromethane/hexane (1:2, v:v) solution at room temperature. The crystallographic data and refinement parameters are presented as supporting info in Table S1. The ORTEP drawn for complex 4 is given in Figure 3. Complex 4 showed a slightly distorted octahedral geometry around the ruthenium centre, which was coordinated by benzimidazole, two chlorine ligands in a trans configuration, and a η6- π-bound hexamethylbenzene ring. However, the geometry around the ruthenium could be regarded as a tetrahedron with considerable trigonal distortion, while considering the centre of the η6-hexametyhlbenzene aromatic ring as the fourth ligand position. The Cl1─Ru1─Cl2, Cl1─Ru1─N21, and Cl2─Ru1─N21 bond angles (mean 86.04° for complex 4) are smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle (109.47°). The bond length, angles, and torsion angles of complex 4 were given in Table 2. The Ru―N bond length was in an average range around 2.1254 (Å). The N21―C29 bond is slightly shorter (1.322 (Å)) than the N28―C29 bond (1.352 (Å)) due to the σ-bonded nitrogen atom of the benzimidazole liganded to the Ru metal. According to the literature,25 there is only one ruthenium (II)-arene benzimidazole complex with the same coordination sphere. The single crystal parameters obtained were consistent with the literature.25

Surface morphology analyses of the complexes were investigated via the SEM images in Figure 4A-D. In Figure 4A,B, it is clear that complex 2 has a more uniformly shaped crystalline structure compared with complex 1. The advantage of this particle structure for capacitor use is that it provides more surface area than complex 1. It is well known from capacitor studies that the increase in surface area increases the amount of redox reaction and hence the capacity.26 Furthermore, in the complex 3 SEM image (Figure 4C), it is clear that the complex has a wire structure and an increase in the surface area. In complex 4, the particle structure with irregular size distribution is observed (Figure 4D). The effects of surface morphologies on the capacitive properties of complexes are discussed in the electrochemical test results.

We compare the experimentally obtained data and theoretically optimized structure of the complexes and used Gaussian program for optimization of the structure of the complexes 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 5) and (Table 2). The coordination states and ligands in the complexes drastically changed the structure of the molecular symmetries. To compare the structural properties of the complexes, we first compared the theoretically optimized and experimentally obtained structural properties of complex 4 (Table 1). The bond lengths of complex 4 deviated between experimental and theoretical bond lengths for Ru1―Cl1, N28―C30, and C32―C33 by 3.6%, 0.3%, and 0.8%, respectively. Therefore, the optimized and experimentally obtained structure parameters were well fitted with each other.

The B3LYP/LanL2DZ basis set during to DFT calculations was used for the determinations of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the complexes presented in Figure 5. The energy of HOMO and LUMO orbitals and Eg values for all complexes are given in Table 3. The highest HOMO energy among the molecules belonged to complex 3, and the lowest energy of LUMO corresponded to complex 2. According to Table 3, the Eg values were in the order of complex 3 > complex 2 > complex 1. The Eg values of complex 1 and complex 2 were very close to each other, because the spatial symmetry of both complexes were similar in structure. Therefore, we could conclude from the geometry and the Eg values of the complexes that the spatial symmetry had a deep indirect relationship with the Eg values for similar complexes. In addition, the Eg was directly related to the ionization energy, and the higher Eg was less relevant to electron transfer in the structure.

3.2 Electrochemical properties and cycling performance of the complexes
In the last decade, the properties of energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, have been developed. Among these, the electrochemical capacitors have been given more attention than conventional capacitors by scientists due to their high storage capacity and their compatibility. Furthermore, the investigation of the new electrode materials is a challenging issue for scientists and technology firms. Because of this, we focused on the organometallic complexes for possible applications of the electrochemical capacitors.
We fabricated electrochemical capacitor (hybrid-capacitor) cells using a CR2032 case, and complexes 1 to 4 were used as the electrode materials of the devices. It is well known that the CV graphs of electrochemical capacitors, such as supercapacitors, should theoretically be rectangular. In addition, they may exhibit hysteretic peaks during reduction and oxidation of the cells.18 The oxidation and reduction peaks may show reversible structures depending on the electrode materials.
In this study, we designed four different capacitor cells using complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the CV graphs of the cells are presented in Figure 6 between −1 and +1 V for 100, 200, and 400 mV/s. From the CV graphs of complexes, we did not observe any oxidation or reduction peaks. The area inside the CV graph was related to storage capacity of the cells, which increased with increasing scanning rate.27 In light of this, the highest current densities and areas were observed in complexes 2 and 3, and the lowest value was in complex 4. From the CV data, complex 2 and 3 showed the best electrochemical performances.

Figure 7A presents the first charge and discharge curves of the capacitors in the potential range of −1 V to +1 V. While the charge curve exhibited an increase for constant positive current, the discharge curve exhibited an exponential decrease for negative current. The time of the charge and discharge curve was directly related to capacitance values of the cells (Figure 7A). The capacitance values of the cells were calculated using Equation (1):

where I is the applied constant current, which is positive for charging and negative for discharging, ΔV/Δt is the slope of the charge and discharge curve, and m is the mass of the active materials on the Ti substrate.

Figure 7B shows the capacities over 800 cycles, and the highest performance was obtained for complex 1 (specific capacitance of 57 F/g), but it had a short cycling value of 50 cycles. We attribute this performance to the structural decomposition of complex 1 in 6 M KOH, because the colour of complex 1 turned from dark red to black. This observation indicates that structural decomposition may prevent the diffusion of ions between electrodes. Therefore, we concluded that complex 1 was not a suitable material for capacitive applications in the present structure. The highest capacitive performance after complex 1 was found for complex 2, as observable in the CV analysis. Another important expectation for a hybrid capacitor is its cyclability without loss of capacity. Although complexes 2 and 4 exhibited better capacity fades up to 800 cycles, the best performance among the other complexes belonged to complex 2, as detailed information shows in Table 4. When the specific capacity values of the complexes were compared the existing capacitor studies about organometallic complexes (as seen in Table 4), a band around 20 F/g is seen for this type of materials. It is important to understand the mechanism of charge storage in this device as discussed subsequently.

During the cycling of the cells, the capacity fades of complexes 2, 3, and 4 did not change after 200 cycles. This indicates that those complexes exhibited higher structural stabilities than complex 1, which is important for commercial applications.
According to the voltage time graphs, charged particles accumulate in each electrode region, which causes the increase of voltage, and the voltage decreases with the application of negative current to system. Therefore, we examined this behaviour in light of molecular interactions. It is well known that the electronic structures of the complexes have both positively and negatively charged regions in their structures. DFT allows us to calculate the electrostatic surface potentials of the molecules, and it easily determines the electrostatically charged and neutral regions in the materials. This information may be useful for electrochemical interactions, because the ionic mobility in the cells was provided by the ions in the electrolyte. The ions in the electrolyte are in the form K+ and OH−. When positive and negative voltages were applied to the capacitor cells, it led to the formation of the electrical field from one electrode to another. When the K+ ions move with the same direction of the electric field, the OH− ions go towards the negative direction of the fields due to the basic relationship of F = qE, where q is the charged particle, E is the applied electric field, and F is the electrical force. In line with this information, the surfaces of the all complexes have a crucial role for their interactions with charged ions in the electrolyte. Figure 8 presents the schematic illustration of the capacitor cells and the electrostatic potentials (ESP) of complexes 2, 3, and 4. While the blue colour shows positive charge, the red colour belongs to negative charge, and green indicates the electrically neutral regions in the complexes. According to ESP, while a large part of complex 2 exhibited an almost neutral charge, it had negatively charged regions around the Cl− ions. In line with this, the K+ ions accumulate around the Cl− ions, and the OH− ions move away from the Cl− ions in the structure. When the voltage was applied to the device, much of the K+ ions could have led to the red and green regions, while the OH− ions were forced to go the green regions. In this case, K+ ions spend more time around Cl− ions, and this could lead to an increase of the capacity of the cell. Due to the structural similarities of complexes 2 and 3, it is possible to make a similar conclusion for complex 3. In the case of complex 4, according to the ESP results, it generally had red regions, as seen in Figure 8. The OH− ions were pushed back to the membrane region, and the ionic conductivity on the cell could be reduced. Therefore, the capacity of the cells decreased to smaller values than those of the other complexes. According to these observations, better capacitive performance could be obtained for the organometallic complexes that have both negatively and positively charged regions on their structures. In addition to this, the surface area has a crucial role on the capacitor cells, and as observable in the SEM section, the rod-like growth had higher surface area, and so it directly affected the capacitance of the cells. Therefore, the highest surface area among the complexes belonged to complex 4, and it showed the highest specific capacity when compared with the others. So, the expected capacitor mechanism in this study should be related surface structure of the complexes, and if the surface structure is modified, it could obtain better results.

The Nyquist plots, obtained from an EIS analysis from 1 mHz to 100 kHz for all complexes, are presented in Figure 9. There are three regions in these curves: one is the beginning region of semicircle structure created by the resistance of electrolyte with contacting electrodes, the current collector, and the end of the semicircle leading to the internal resistance of the electrodes.28 The second region of the plot is the combination of the resistive and capacitive interactions of the ions, which penetrate pores in the active materials. This region generally gives a slope of 45° and corresponds to the middle frequency of the data. The lengths, slopes, and positions of these regions were affected by the changes in the chemical structures of the active materials. The last region on the plot can be explained by the dominance of capacitive behaviour in the cells, and it corresponds to the low-frequency region of the plot. The plot can give information about electrolyte resistance, charge transfer, polarization effects, and the diffusion of the ions in the electrodes. According to Figure 9, while complex 1 shows a small semicircle, complexes 2 and 3 exhibited larger semicircle, and complex 4 did not present a semicircle structure.

4 CONCLUSION
The structural properties of the complexes 2 to 4 were investigated by FTIR, Raman, single crystal XRD, and DFT methods. It is found that the theoretical calculations were well fitted to the experimentally obtained data. The Eg values obtained were 3.6714, 3.6840, and 3.7391 eV for complexes 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In surface morphology analyses, it was observed that complexes 2 and 3 had the highest surface areas. Because of this, the best CV performances belonged to complexes 2 and 3. The specific capacitances of the complexes for the first cycle were 57.5, 22.1, 16.9, and 0.0021 F/g for complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Complex 1 was decomposed in the cell, which could be due to the structural stability problem of this material. We also investigated the capacitive mechanisms of the cells in light of molecular interactions. We suggest that the ESP values of the molecules were directly related to the capacitive performance of the cells. In addition to this, the best cycling performance was obtained for complex 2, which had the lowest Eg value compared with the other complexes. In conclusion, organometallic complexes 2 and 3 could have better capacitive performance because they have oppositely charged regions.
