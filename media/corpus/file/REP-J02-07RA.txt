In the 2007 recommendations, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) changed from a process-based system of practices and intervention to a system based on the characteristics of the radiation exposure situation. In addition, the ICRP now recommends the application of source-related dose constraints under a planned exposure situation as a tool for the optimization of measures to protect the workers and members of the public. In this study, an analysis of radioactive effluents from Korean nuclear power plants and a public dose assessment were conducted using these source-related dose constraints. As a result, this analysis suggests appropriate dose constraints for members of the public taking into account the operation of multi-unit nuclear reactors at a single site in Korea.

1.Introduction
The International Commission on Radiological Pro- tection (ICRP) issued the new 2007 recommendations as ICRP Publication 103, reinforcing the principle of the optimization of measures of protection [1]. The Inter- national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also revised its basic safety standards (BSS) to take into account ICRP Publication 103 [2]. In Korea, the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), the Korean nuclear regulatory body, completed a long-term research project in 2011 to apply ICRP Publication 103 to revise the procedures of regulatory guidance according to the new IAEA BSS Se- ries No. GSR Part 3 (Interim) [3]. It is expected that nu- clear safety laws will be amended based on the research results after 2013 [3].
ICRP Publication 103 categorizes three types of ex- posure situations: planned exposure situations, emer- gency exposure situations, and existing exposure situ- ations [1]. Appropriate guidance for each situation is also provided [1,4]. Furthermore, the revised recommen- dations emphasize dose constraints under planned ex- posure situations and reference levels under emergency and existing exposure situations as the key aspects of the principle of optimization. Radiation exposure to members of the public adjacent to nuclear power plants
(NPPs) is an example of a planned exposure situation. The ICRP recognizes that it is possible to achieve op- timization for members of the public through the es- tablishment of appropriate dose constraint levels for prospective and predicted doses occurring as a result of the operation of a NPP [1,4].
In order to determine the appropriate dose con- straint levels for members of the public, this study in- vestigated the concept of dose constraints as defined  in ICRP Publication 103 and in the Korean regulatory guidance while also investigating the current status of the implementation of dose constraints at Korean NPPs. In addition, the annual release of radioactive effluents into the environment and its corresponding dose lev- els for members of the public were analyzed. Finally, this study suggests acceptable and appropriate dose con- straints for members of the public taking into account the operation of multi-unit nuclear reactors at a single site in Korea.
2.Concept of the ICRP’s dose constraints
According to ICRP Publication 103, dose con- straints are used for limiting  individual  doses  dur-  ing the process of the optimization of protection
