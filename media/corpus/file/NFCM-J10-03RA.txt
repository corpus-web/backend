Abstract
New materials were synthesized for application in sorption of radionuclides from aqueous solutions. The elaboration was performed by conversion of power plant ash using the hydrothermal method under optimum experimental conditions. Sodalite, Na-Y, and analcime were formed from ash precursor during the treatment, exhibiting thermal stability as revealed by the characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume were determined and they presented higher values than plant ash. The ability of the new products to retain Ba and Eu radionuclides was studied in aqueous solutions using 133Ba and 152Eu as tracers and γ-ray spectroscopy under batch experiments. The experimental data were modeled by the Langmuir and Freundlich equations, whereas sorption kinetics measurements were performed at 293, 308, and 323 K and thermodynamic parameters were calculated. The release of the sorbed ions into the environment was also tested by leaching experiments. The results of these tests indicated that the synthesized materials are very efficient in removing the aforementioned metals from aqueous solutions and can be considered as potential low-cost sorbents in nuclear waste management.

1. Introduction
Recently, various techniques such as adsorption, precipitation, and ion exchange have been applied in radioactive waste management to test new materials. Among these materials (inorganic ion exchangers, clays and zeolites, ash-based sorbents) natural and synthetic zeolites are particularly preferred, because they are very effective sorbents. Zeolites are microporous materials widely used as molecular sieves in environment remediation, radioactive waste, and industrial applications for selective adsorption of positively charged contaminant species (Misaelides, 2011). Their ion exchange capacity is rather high depending on the Si/Al framework ratio, which ranges between 1 and 3.
Zeolites can be synthesized from power station ashes, as the chemical composition of ash shows similarities to some volcanic precursors of natural zeolites (Gross et al., 2007, Gupta et al., 2009, Reijnders, 2005, Wang and Wu, 2006, Wdowin et al., 2014).
At present, the effective utilization and conversion of ash to other materials is an economic and environment-friendly solution considering the large quantities of ash (more than 600 Mt), which are worldwide produced every year, creating a disposal problem (Ahmaruzzaman, 2010, Bhangare et al., 2014, Wang and Wu, 2006). Therefore, the modification of ashes and their potential application as sorbents for the removal of hazardous species from waters, wastewaters, soils, and especially radionuclides has attracted increased research interest recently (Buema et al., 2014; El-Naggar et al., 2008; Noli et al., 2015, Penilla et al., 2006).
Various types of zeolites (e.g., A-, P-, and N-type zeolites, sodalite, and faujasite) have been produced depending on the chemical composition of ashes and other parameters such as temperature, concentration of alkaline reagent, reaction time, and solid-to-liquid ratio (Adamczyk and Bialecka, 2005, Ryu et al., 2006).
For example, high-quality zeolites X were synthesized from ash by Fan et al. (2008) using high reaction temperatures and crystallization times (temperature and time up to 550 °C and 26 h, respectively). K–H zeolite (K2Al2Si4O12·nH2O) was successfully produced by Mimura et al. (2001) under optimum conditions (temperature: 160 °C, time: 3 days), whereas Gross et al. (2007) reported the formation of faujasite from fly ash selecting lower synthesis temperatures (50 °C) but longer time (up to 100 days).
The objective of this study was to convert ash to zeolitic materials using a simple and low-cost method for application in nuclear waste management for the removal of Ba and Eu. The retention of barium and europium is of special importance, because Ba is an ideal analog of Ra, which is also important in radioactive waste considerations, and presents high mobility in the geosphere and thus gains more access to the food chain (Toxicological Profile for Barium, 2007, Baeza-Alvarado and Olguı´n, 2011, Chavez et al., 2010, Chmielewská-Horváthová, 1998, Zhang et al., 2001, Shahwan et al., 2002). On the contrary, Eu is connected with the nuclear fuel cycle and is frequently used as natural homolog of the trivalent actinides (e.g., Am and Cm) (El-Kamash et al., 2007, Moussa et al., 2013, Naveau et al., 2005, Shao et al., 2009, Sharma and Tomar, 2011, Sun et al., 2014, Wenming et al., 2001). The number of studies investigating the sorption of these metals is rather limited in the literature.
The new sorbents were synthesized by selecting optimum experimental conditions, and their characterization was performed by various techniques. The Eu and Ba sorption properties of the synthesized materials were investigated using radiochemical techniques, and modeling and kinetics data were obtained.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials Synthesis
Ash from a Romanian thermal power plant was used for the synthesis of the new sorbents. The whole procedure was carried out by the direct activation method using 5 M NaOH at temperatures of 70 and 90 °C. Our previous studies have shown that increase of temperature, treatment time, or quantity of the alkali results in the formation of materials with different properties (composition in zeolites, porosity, surface area). High NaOH concentration (5 M) and reaction temperature (90 °C) lead to crystallization of zeolites (10–11). Hence, the following experimental conditions were selected for this study: (i) solid-to-liquid (S:L) ratio, 1:5 and 1:3, respectively; (ii) concentration of NaOH, 5 M; (iii) temperature, 70 and 90 °C; and (iv) reaction time, 4 and 15 h. After the treatment, the synthesized materials were annealed for 18 h at ambient temperature, filtered, washed, and dried.
2.2. Materials characterization
The surface microstructure and chemical composition of the raw material (ash) and the synthesized materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS) using a JEOL JSM 840A microscope equipped with an OXFORD ISIS 300 EDS microanalyzer and QUANTA 3D – AL99/D8229. The mineralogical composition of the materials was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X'PERT PRO MRD equipment. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was applied using the SETA-RAM SetSys-1200 model in N2 atmosphere, whereas the porosity and specific surface area were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using an Autosorb 1-MP gas sorption system (Quantachrome Instruments). Nitrogen sorption was carried out at −196 °C, and the samples were degassed under high vacuum at 350 °C for 3 h before analysis.
The zeta potential of the materials was determined using a Brookhaven ZetaPALS instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Brookhaven, Holtsville, NY, USA). Very dilute suspensions (5 mg mL−1) of the material in ultrapure water were prepared. The pH was adjusted by adding NaOH or ΗΝΟ3 solutions. After achieving equilibrium, the samples were measured at 25 °C, using a refractive index 1.330 for the aqueous phase and a viscosity of 890 cP.
2.3. Sorption experiments
The sorption experiments were conducted by adding approximately 50 mg of the sorbents in 10 mL of the solution of the elements under investigation in polypropylene tubes. The quantity of each sorbent was weighted using a balance KERN 770 (d=0.01 mg) and the volume of the solution was measured using an Eppendorf pipette. The samples were agitated at ambient temperature for 24 h. Therefore, in order to optimize the pH for maximum sorption efficiency, experiments have been conducted in the pH range of 2–7 for an equilibration time of 5 h. Stock solutions of BaCl2 spiked with 133Ba (1.4 Bq/mL) and Eu(NO3)3·H2O spiked with 152Eu (2.1 Bq/mL) with initial concentration between 10 and 1000 mg/L were prepared using analytical grade reagents dissolved in bi-distilled water. Before the sorption experiments, the pH of the solutions was adjusted by adding HCl and NaOH. After separation of the solid from the liquid phase by centrifugation and filtration (0.22-μm filter), the equilibrium pH was measured by a Metron pH meter (±0.1) and the element concentration in the liquid phase was determined. The Ba and Eu concentrations in the supernatant solution were determined by γ-ray spectroscopy using a HPGe detector (CANBERRA, REGe detector, efficiency 20%, energy resolution 2.1 keV for the 1332-keV 60Co γ radiation) connected with a standard computer-based gamma spectroscopy setup. A small amount (5 mL) of the solution was placed in vials of standard geometry and measured after measuring the blank (labeled solution without sorbent). The counting time varied between 700 and 1000 s to obtain good statistics resulting in activities from 0.88 up to 1.59 counts per second. The overall uncertainty of the measurements was estimated to be 5–7%.
Further experiments concerning the influence of competing cations on the sorption capacity (the presence of background electrolyte 0.1 M NaNO3), as well as sorption kinetics, were conducted using the most effective sorbent. The kinetics experiments were performed at 298, 308, and 323 (±0.5) K and the data were modeled using the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic equations (Fan et al., 2008). For the kinetics measurements, 1.25 g of the adsorbent was contacted with 250 mL of the labeled solution (experimental conditions: solution concentration 250 mg/L and pH 4). At predetermined time intervals, 2 mL of sample aliquots were withdrawn and the metal concentration was determined. The kinetic model parameters were finally determined by linear regression. All the experiments were performed in duplicate.
2.4. Leaching tests
Leaching tests were performed according to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (EPA Test Method 1311-TCLP) to study the environmental compatibility of the loaded materials, in the case of their geological disposal. The material (0.5 g) was contacted for 24 h with 100 mL of 250 mg/L of metal solution (Noli et al., 2015). The solid was separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation and then the loaded sorbent was washed with distilled water and suspended in the TCLP extraction fluid. The leached metal concentration was determined after a contact time of 20 h in the extraction liquid by γ-ray spectroscopy as described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the materials
The characterization of the materials, presented in a previous study, was performed by SEM–EDS and XRD (Noli et al., 2015). The SEM–EDS results revealed that the ash and the new modified products were mainly composed of Al2O3, SiO2, Na2O, MgO, CaO, and FeO. The chemical composition in mass % was: O 43.3, Na 0.8, Mg 0.6, Al 19.1, Si 30.8, K 1.7, Ca 1.1, Ti 0.5, and Fe 2.1 for the raw ash and O 32.9–39.4, Na 1.0–8.9, Mg 0.8–1.3, Al 13.4–14.3, Si 17.2–26.4, K 0.5–2.1, Ca 1.2–4.7, Ti 0.8–0.9, and Fe 2.5–8.9 for the modified materials. The presence of mullite (3Al2O3 2SiO2 or 2Al2O3 SiO2), quartz (SiO2), and small amounts of hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) was also verified by XRD (Buema et al., 2014, Noli et al., 2015). The formation of NaP1 and Na-Y was observed only for the materials modified at the temperature of 90 °C (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the reaction temperature is critical for the formation of zeolitic phases, whereas the reaction time determines the degree of modification.

Fig. 2 presents the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms for the ash and the modified materials. The significant increase in the nitrogen adsorption capacity after hydrothermal treatment indicates increase of porosity. The sorption isotherms can be classified as type IV with hysteresis loop-type H3, where the mesoporous structure of the materials is evident from the characteristic hysteresis loop at the relative pressure range P/P0>0.4 (Sharma and Tomar, 2011). A steep increase in adsorption volume for the treated materials occurs at relative pressure P/P0<0.01. The initial (steepest) part indicates micropore filling and the low slope of the plateau is due to multilayer adsorption on the small external area. It seems that the alkali treatment produces mainly micropores and the modified materials have two types of pores: micropores (0–2 nm) and mesopores (2–50 nm). The pore range of 1.7–300 nm was analyzed by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The pore size distribution data calculated from the adsorption branches of nitrogen isotherms by the BJH method showed that the mesopores are centered at 39 nm. These findings are also in agreement with the SEM data, where an enhanced microstructure was observed in the case of Z90-15 sample (Noli et al., 2015). The BET surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vpore), as well as some characteristics of the ash and synthesized materials are presented in Table 1.

The point of zero charge was determined by measuring the ζ potential at various pH values of dilute sorbent suspensions. Fig. 3 shows the ζ potential of the sorbents as a function of pH. The pH at zero ζ potential is represented as pHpzc (Naveau et al., 2005). The resultant pHpzc was found to be 6.1, 5.9, 5.4, and 4.5 for the ash, Z70-4, Z90-4, and Z90-15, respectively, which implies that the surface charge on each sorbent is positive below the pHpzc and negative above pHpzc. Therefore, it can be expected that positively charged metal ions are likely to adsorb onto the negatively charged fly ash particles at pH above these values.

Fig. 4a and b shows the TG and DTA curves for the ash and Z90-15, respectively, obtained in the temperature interval 25–900 °C. In the case of the materials modified at 90 °C (Z90-4 and Z90-15), the TG curves exhibited a decrease of 5% in sample weight with increasing temperature up to 200 °C. This weight loss was accompanied with an endothermic peak, which indicates the removal of physically adsorbed water. Increase of temperature up to 700 °C shows a thermal stability of the sample, whereas a further decrease of 8% in sample weight was observed with increasing temperature up to 900 °C. This could be attributed to the dehydration of water molecules impeded in internal structure (El-Kamash et al., 2007). In the case of the raw ash (and in the case of Z70-4), a lower decrease (~6%) in sample weight was observed up to 500 °C, because of the loss of water and, at higher temperatures, the observed extensive weight loss could be attributed to phase transformation.

3.2. Sorption experiments
The sorption experiments were carried out using batch equilibrium technique and the influence of parameters such as initial concentration, pH, and contact time were tested to evaluate the best material for the removal of Ba and Eu ions from aqueous solutions. For solutions of different initial concentrations (50–1000 mg/L), the investigation in the pH range of 2–7 showed that the metal uptake is slightly increased at higher pH values, most probably because of decrease of the competition with hydrogen cations for the same adsorption sites. The maximum uptake values were observed at pH values between 4 and 5. The values of the equilibrium pH were also recorded and found to be considerably higher (about 2.5–3.0 units) than the initial ones. Considering the speciation diagrams for barium and europium, calculated by the computer code MEDUSA, the sorption experiments were performed at pH 4 to avoid precipitation (MEDUSA (Make Equilibrium Diagrams Using Sophisticated Algorithms), 1983).
Fig. 5 presents the variation of the sorption capacity of the sorbents under investigation as a function of equilibrium concentration. It is evident from the figure that the raw ash has the lowest sorption capacity followed by the material Z70-4. Significant removal capacity (~100%) was exhibited by the material modified at 90 °C (Z90-4 and Z90-15) leading to the conclusion that the removal efficiency is associated with the degree of zeolite formation.
Fig. 5. Sorption capacity of the investigated sorbents as a function of equilibrium concentration.
Adsorption equilibrium is usually described by an isotherm equation, whose parameters indicate the surface properties and affinity of the adsorbent at a fixed temperature and pH. An adsorption isotherm describes the relationship between the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent and the equilibrium concentration (Ce) of the dissolved adsorbate in the liquid. Because of this fact, the adsorption isotherms, for the removal of Ba and Eu-ions from aqueous solutions onto ash and synthesized materials, were modeled using the more common Langmuir and Freundlich equations, which are defined as.
Langmuir model:
@(1)
and the linear form
@(2)
where
Ce=the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate (mg/L),
qe=the amount of metal adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium (mg/g),
qm=the maximum monolayer coverage capacity (mg/g), and
KL=the constant related to the energy of adsorption (Langmuir constant) (L/mg).
Freundlich model:
@(3)
and the linear form
@(4)
where KF and n are Freundlich constants (KF is the equilibrium constant (mg/g), which characterizes the adsorption capacity of the sorbent and n is a parameter indicating the system heterogeneity).
The Langmuir model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the surface with no transmigration of adsorbate in the plane of the surface (localized monolayer adsorption) whereas for the Freundlich model the energy is distributed (surface heterogeneity) and often describes sorption at low concentrations satisfactorily (Freundlich, 1906, Langmuir, 1916).
From the corresponding regression equations and the graphical representation of linearized forms, the values of Langmuir and Freundlich parameters were obtained and presented in Table 2a, Table 2ba and b (Freundlich, 1906, Langmuir, 1916).

The form of the isotherms and the values of regression coefficients (R2) lead to the conclusion that the experimental data follow both Freundlich and Langmuir models. The material modified at 90 °C for 15 h showed higher uptake capacity and was selected for the investigation of the sorption kinetics and the effect of the presence of competing cations.
The sorption capacity values found in this study for the synthetic zeolites are higher than those appeared in the literature for Ba sorption using other relevant materials. For example, values lower than 40 mg/g were reported by Chavez et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2001 using clinoptilolite tuff and montmorillonite clay, Chmielewská-Horváthová (1998) using Clinoptilolite and Mordenite, and Shahwan et al. (2002) using kaolinite and bentonite for Ba removal. In the case of europium, Macasek et al. (1999) reported lower values using montmorillonite, and the same conclusion was reached by Wenming et al. (2001) using bentonite and Shao et al. (2009) and Sun et al. (2014) using zeolite and sepiolite, respectively. Relevant data were reported by Sharma et al., 2008, Sharma et al., 2009 using an analog of heulandites. On the contrary, the same research group found high sorption capacity values up to 400 mg/g, using high concentrations of Eu solutions (0.03–3 M) and nanocomposite zeolites synthesized from ash under optimum conditions (reaction temperature 170 °C and reaction time 24 h).
The removal of metal cations from solutions is a rather complex phenomenon, which is controlled by different mechanisms (e.g., absorption/ion exchange, adsorption, surface precipitation/coprecipitation, and complexation) depending on a number of parameters (e.g., physical properties of the sorbent, pH, temperature, and the presence of competing ions). When the sorbents used are ashes (complicated materials due to different chemical and mineralogical compositions), the removal process becomes more complex. The investigation of the effect of competing ions, contact time, and temperature on the sorption behavior for Ba and Eu ions is of significant importance, to obtain a deeper insight into the sorption properties of the new materials over the above conditions (background electrolyte, temperature, and time).
The experiments in the presence of background electrolyte 0.1 M NaNO3 led to lower uptake values (~25%) due to the competition of Na+ with the cations of barium and europium. The adsorbed metal ions are easily replaced by the Na+ cations, resulting in decrease of the sorption. Adsorption, especially of divalent alkaline earth ions, has been considered to occur by the formation of an outer-sphere surface complex between the metal ion and the negatively charged surface at the solid–solution interface (Katz et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2001). In our case, the slight effect of the pH and the strong influence of ionic strength on the sorption process suggest that ion exchange and/or outer-sphere complex formation mechanisms predominate.
Furthermore, the removal efficiency was studied as a function of the contact time. Fig. 6 presents the kinetics of the Ba and Eu removal from aqueous solutions of initial concentration 250 mg/L at pHinit 4. In both cases, the equilibrium was achieved in short time (30–40 min), indicating the effectiveness of the synthesized sorbent to remove the selective metal cations from aqueous solutions. Increase of the temperature led to the increase of the removal efficiency indicating physical adsorption.

where k1 and k2 are the rate constants for the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second order kinetic equations and qe and qt are the mass of the absorbed metal per weight unit of the sorbent at equilibrium and at time t, respectively. The parameters obtained by the fitting of all experimental data using the aforementioned kinetic equations are given in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3, the kinetics of the removal of barium and europium by the modified ash seems to be described by the pseudo-second-order model, resulting in a straight line in the plot t/Qt for all investigated temperatures. By constructing the plot of log k2 as a function of 1/T, it was possible to calculate the activation energy (Ea) of the uptake process using the Arrhenius equation:
@(9)
where k is the rate coefficient, A is a constant, Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature (K).

In addition, thermodynamic parameters, such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), entropy (ΔS°), and enthalpy (ΔH°), were also calculated and presented in Table 4a, Table 4ba and b:

As indicated by the positive ΔH° value, the process of sorption is endothermic in both cases, whereas the value of the sorption energy reflects the affinity of the ion exchange material for the metal ions. The positive value of ΔS° indicates increased randomness at the solid–solution interface during the sorption and the negative ΔG° values, especially in the case of barium sorption, the spontaneous nature of the process (El-Kamash et al., 2007, Sharma and Tomar, 2011).
3.3. Leaching experiments
The fundamental safety concept is also the environmental compatibility of the loaded sorbents during their disposal. Hence, an attempt to investigate the release of the sorbed radionuclides into the environment was made. As observed from the results of Table 5, the leachability of Ba and Eu ions increases strongly with the most acidic solution TCLP2 of pH 2.9. According to the total characteristic leaching procedure, the metal transferred in the leachate was varied in the case of the zeolitic materials from 4.4% up to 7.6%. These values are lower than the limited data presented in the literature and, concerning leaching studies, verifying that the new sorbents can be used as potential backfill materials.

4. Conclusions
Power plant ash was modified to new materials with different structure and morphology as well as higher specific surface area and thermal stability. The procedure was modified after alkali treatment under moderate conditions. The formation of zeolitic phases was found to be associated with the reaction temperature, reaction time, and solid-to-liquid ratio.
The new synthesized materials, especially those with zeolitic structure, exhibited high efficiency of removal of Ba and Eu ions from aqueous solutions. The experimental results indicated that the sorption depends on the concentration of the solutions, contact time, temperature, and the presence of competing cations (0.1 NaNO3).
The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations were applied for the modeling of the experimental data and found to describe effectively the Ba and Eu uptake values.
The kinetic data showed that the pseudo-second-order equation was more suitable to describe the sorption mechanism.
The calculated thermodynamic parameters for the material Z90-15 showed that the process of sorption is endothermic in both cases (Ba and Eu sorption), whereas the values of the sorption energy characterize an ion exchange-type reaction. The positive values of ΔS° indicate increased randomness at the solid–solution interface during the sorption and the negative ΔG° values, especially in the case of barium, the spontaneous nature of the process.
Leaching tests also proved the safe disposal of the loaded sorbents into the environment.
The simple and economic production of the new synthetic materials in combination with their excellent properties indicate that they are promising sorbents for the removal of special interested metal ions from large volumes of aqueous solutions.
