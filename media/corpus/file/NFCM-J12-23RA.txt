Abstract
This work investigated the thermal neutron, mechanical, morphological, and dielectric properties of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composites with the addition of varying samarium oxide (Sm2O3) contents from 0 to 50 wt% in 10 wt% increments for potential uses as durable thermal neutron shielding materials. The results showed that adding Sm2O3 powder could substantially improve the thermal neutron shielding properties of the composites, in which the recommended Sm2O3 content was in the range of 10–20 wt%. The results also showed that an increased Sm2O3 content increased the tensile modulus and hardness (Shore D), but decreased the tensile strength, elongation at break, and dielectric strength. Furthermore, the results on the effects of gamma irradiation (exposure doses of 35 kGy and 70 kGy) on the properties of the UHMWPE composites suggested that gamma irradiation could induce changes in the mechanical and dielectric properties. In summary, the overall properties of interest suggested that the developed Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites could be effectively used as durable thermal neutron shielding materials with Sm2O3 powder acting as an enhancement for neutron attenuation.

1. Introduction
Due to the fast-growing amount of improved equipment and new knowledge of neutrons, wider neutron-related applications are now possible including neutron imaging and neutron microscopy (Trtik et al., 2015; Kardjilov et al., 2016), boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer treatment (Haapaniemi et al., 2016; Mirzaei et al., 2016), elemental analysis for research and forensic applications (Kucera et al., 2018), and plant mutation breeding (Hwang et al., 2015). However, excessive exposure to neutrons could possibly affect the functionality and/or wellness of neutron users and the general public. Possible symptoms of acute and chronic neutron exposure include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, headache, skin burns, cancers, and death, depending on the duration/amount of exposure and responsiveness of organs (Walsh, 2013).
Sufficient neutron shielding materials that could attenuate incoming neutron flux to within safe operating limits are required to prevent undesirable effects from neutron exposure. In principle, neutron shielding materials comprise high contents of low-atomic-number elements, such as, hydrogen (H), due to their large scattering power that could reduce substantial amounts of neutron energy. Hydrogen-rich materials that are commonly used as neutron shields include paraffin (Toyen and Saenboonruang, 2017; Y. Zhang et al., 2017), natural and synthetic rubbers (Ozdemir et al., 2016; Ninyong et al., 2017), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composites (Soltani et al., 2016; X. Zhang et al., 2017). In addition, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a thermoplastic that has high potential to be used in effective and durable neutron shielding materials due to its high hydrogen content, high impact and tensile strengths, excellent abrasion resistance, good biocompatibility, low frictional coefficient, and excellent dielectric properties (Liu et al., 2011), offering possible uses of UHMWPE composites for spent fuel storage, transport casks, equipment used in cancer treatment, construction parts, and electrical equipment containers in nuclear facilities (Kommling et al., 2018).
Although the scattering mechanism between neutrons and hydrogen atoms could attenuate neutron flux by subsequently reducing neutron energy, the process usually requires multiple interactions, resulting in relatively thick shielding materials needed for sufficient attenuation. For example, it would require thicknesses of 1.8 cm and 8 cm of polyethylene (PE) to reduce 2-MeV and 15-MeV neutrons, respectively, to half of the initial intensity (Zarezadeh, 2013). Compounds containing high-neutron-absorption-cross-section (σabs) elements, such as boron oxide (B2O3), boron carbide (B4C), and boron nitride (BN), are commonly used as neutron-absorbing fillers to enhance the neutron shielding ability of materials. Examples of such composites are epoxy/clay/B4C (Kiani et al., 2017), B2O3/EPDM rubber (Ozdemir et al., 2017), and BN/Gd2O3/HDPE (Irim et al., 2018). Despite the common use of these boron-containing materials as neutron shields, the shielding abilities could be further enhanced by introducing higher-σabs compounds, such as samarium oxide (Sm2O3), to the materials. Since natSm has a higher σabs than natB (5.9 × 103 b for natSm compared with 760 b for natB), the probability of neutron absorption for natSm is higher than for natB, leading to potentially less material thickness being required to produce better neutron shielding/mechanical properties of the materials (Sears, 1992; Cao et al., 2010). Furthermore, natSm atoms have a relatively high atomic number (Z = 62), presenting as self-gamma (γ) attenuators, in which γ could be released after neutron absorption, leading to improved safety for radiation workers and the general public. An example of Sm2O3-filled polymer used as neutron shielding materials is carbon-fiber reinforced Sm2O3/polyimide composites, which showed improved neutron- and gamma-shielding properties, compared with B4C/polyimide composites (Wang et al., 2015).
Thus, this work investigated the properties of UHMWPE composites that were developed to be used as effective and durable thermal neutron shielding materials by introducing Sm2O3 into the composites. The properties of interest in this work were physical, morphological, mechanical, dielectric, and thermal neutron shielding properties. This work also investigated the effects of gamma irradiation with exposure doses of 35 kGy and 70 kGy on the mechanical and dielectric properties of UHMWPE composites to determine any possible change and degradation that might affect the durability of the materials.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and chemicals
UHMWPE powder (U321 grade) was used as the main matrix for this work with an average molecular mass of 3.5 × 106 g/mol, a density of 0.94 g/cm3, and an average particle size of 250 μm,. The formulations, including all the chemicals, their roles, and their suppliers, are given in Table 1.
Table 1. Material formulations of UHMWPE composites and their chemicals, roles, and suppliers.
Chemical	Role	Supplier
UHMWPE (U321)	Main matrix	IRPC Public Co., Ltd. (Thailand)
Sm2O3 (99.99%)	Neutron absorbing filler	Richest Group Co., Ltd. (China)
Paraffinic oil (commercial grade)	Lubricant	Facobis Co., Ltd. (Thailand)
n-Hexane (100 w/w%)	Paraffinic oil dissolver	Chemipan Corporation (Thailand)
The image of the Sm2O3 powder used in this work as a neutron-absorbing filler was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Quanta 450 FEI: JSM-6610LV, Netherland) as shown in Fig. 1. The average particle size was determined using the ImageJ software version 1.50i, which indicated that the Sm2O3 powder had an average particle size of 1.4 μm. The contents of Sm2O3 used in this work were varied from 0 to 50 wt% in 10 wt% increments. It should be noted that in order to overcome the ultrahigh viscosity of UHMWPE (intrinsic viscosity of 1700 ml/g) during the twin-screw extrusion process used for compounding, 10 wt% paraffinic oil was introduced as lubricant to reduce the overall viscosity of UHMWPE so that the use of twin-screw extrusion was possible in this work (Fang et al., 2006).

2.2. Preparation of UHMWPE composites
UHMWPE, Sm2O3 (varying from 0 to 50 wt% in 10 wt% increments) and 10 wt% paraffinic oil were mixed and compounded using a twin-screw extruder (CTW 1000C, Hakke Rheomax, Germany) with temperature settings of 170 °C, 175 °C, 180 °C, and 185 °C for the feed zone, plastification zone, mixing zone, and die zone, respectively, and a screw speed of 40 rpm. The extrudate was pelletized into granules and soaked in n-hexane for 24 h to dissolve and extract paraffinic oil from the Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites. The extrudate was then put in a hot-air oven (GT-7017-L, Gotech Testing Machine, Taiwan) at 80 °C overnight for further extraction of the remaining paraffinic oil. Lastly, the granules were molded using a hot press (LP-20M LMXS, Lab Tech Engineering, Thailand) at a pressure of 150 kg/cm2 and a temperature of 185 °C for 14 min. It should be noted that the area of the mold used in this work was 18 × 18 cm2 with varying thicknesses of 0.5 cm, 0.2 cm, and 0.1 cm for specimens used in the thermal neutron shielding, mechanical, and dielectric strength tests, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
2.3.1. Mechanical properties
The tensile properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break) were investigated using a universal testing machine (Autograph AG-I 5 kN, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), according to the ASTM D638-14 standard. The tensile testing speed used for all specimens was 100 mm/min. For hardness measurement, all specimens were tested according to the ASTM D2240-03 standard testing using a hardness durometer (Shore D) (Teclock GS-719G, Japan). The reported value of all properties was the average of at least five independent measurements.
2.3.2. Dielectric strength properties
All UHMWPE composites were tested for dielectric strength at 25 ± 1 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 2%, according to the ASTM D149-13 standard. Each sample was kept between two electrodes, which were applied with increasing voltages until the breakdown occurred. The dielectric strength for each sample was calculated using Eq. (1):
@(1)
where Vb is the breakdown voltage and d is the specimen thickness.
2.3.3. Thermal neutron shielding properties
The neutron shielding properties of all UHWPE samples were investigated by determining their corresponding neutron transmission ratios, their linear attenuation coefficient (μ), their half value layer (HVL), and their tenth value layer (TVL). The tests were performed at the Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology (TINT) using the experimental setup shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2. Setup for thermal neutron shielding measurement.
A 300-mCi 241Am/Be source sealed in a thick paraffin cylinder was used as the neutron source in this work. Since neutrons emitted from 241Am/Be have an average energy of 4.2 MeV with a maximum energy of 11 MeV (fast neutrons), a stack of 5-cm HDPE sheets was used to thermalize the neutrons. The thermal neutron detector used in this work was a 50.8 mm × 19.8 mm × 140.9 mm rectangular 3He-filled neutron detector, in which all specimens (surface area of 18 cm × 18 cm and varying combined thicknesses of 5–25 mm in 5-mm increments) were placed between the neutron detector and HDPE sheets. It should be noted that 5-cm HDPE was selected as a moderator in this work due to the highest yields of thermal neutrons, the same thickness of HDPE being also referenced by Jumpee and Wongsawaeng (2015), Ninyong et al. (2017), Toyen and Saenboonruang (2017), and Jiang et al. (2019). Furthermore, the neutron shielding results obtained would not be greatly affected by the detection of epi-thermal neutrons and fast neutrons. This was because greater than 90% of transmitted neutron flux after 5-cm HDPE moderation was mainly thermal neutrons, with a small contribution from epi-thermal neutrons, and the 3He detector was far sensitive to thermal neutron detection (Lalonde, 1997). The data acquisition system used for data processing consisted of amplifiers (Ortec 590A, USA) and a counter/timer (Canberra, 2071A, USA), with the set-up signal threshold of the counter higher than signals created by fast neutron detection to ensure negligible contributions from fast neutrons in the calculation of neutron shielding properties. For each specimen, five independent 1 min tests were conducted and average counts (I) of neutrons transmitted were recorded. It should be noted that the average neutron counts without UHMWPE samples were recorded as the reference counts (I0) to determine the neutron transmission ratios (I/I0), μ, HVL, and TVL for all specimens. The equations used for the calculation of HVL and TVL were taken from Ninyong et al. (2017) and Toyen and Saenboonruang (2017), respectively.
2.3.4. Gamma irradiation
Since the developed Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites have high potential for installation in a gamma-rich working environment as well as being irradiated by their own induced gamma rays after neutron absorption, the effects of gamma irradiation on the UHMWPE composites were also investigated. The studies were carried out by placing all specimens in a chamber (GC 5000) containing a 60Co source that emitted 1.173 and 1.332 MeV gamma rays with a dose rate of 3 kGy/hour for the exposure doses of 35 kGy and 70 kGy, respectively. After the gamma irradiation was completed, all irradiated UHWMPE specimens were tested for any change/degradation in mechanical and dielectric properties, following the same procedures previously described in Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2.
2.3.5. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies
A SEM at a 10-kV accelerating voltage with back-scattered electrons was used to study the morphology and the distribution of Sm2O3 particles in the UHWMPE composites. All specimens were coated with gold using a sputter coater (Quorum SC7620: Mini Sputter Coater/Glow Discharge System, England) at a power voltage of 10 kV and a current of 10 mA for 120 s before performing the SEM studies.
2.3.6. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies
FT-IR was used to determined changes in the functional groups of the specimens for each Sm2O3/UHMWPE composite. The FT-IR equipment used in this work was a Bruker: Model Vertex70 (USA) with wavenumbers in the range of 500–4000 cm−1.
2.3.7. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies
XRD was used to determine the phase identification of the UHMWPE composites by investigating their corresponding degrees of crystallinity, which were calculated from the ratio of the total area of crystalline peaks (narrow peaks) and the total area of all peaks (a combination of crystalline and amorphous peaks). The XRD source used in this work was Ni filtered CuKα radiation (Bruker: Model DS Advance, Germany) with scanning angles (2θ) from 5° to 70° and a scanning speed of 0.02°/step. Specimens used in the XRD studies were sized 2  × 2 cm2 with a thickness of 2 mm.
2.3.8. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectroscopy studies
Color index measurement for the study of the possible degradation caused by gamma irradiation was carried out using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer [Shimadzu: Model SolidSpec-3700, Japan) in transmittance mode with a wavelength range of 380–750 nm. The L*, a*, and b* parameters, which represent the color positions of the composites in a lightness axis [black (0) → white (100)], a blue (−) → yellow (+) axis, and a green (−) → red (+) axis (Llusar et al., 2001), respectively, were measured using a standard lighting source C, following the CIE-L*a*b* colorimetric method recommended by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE). In addition, to compare the degrees of change and degradation between non-irradiated and irradiated specimens, the color difference (ΔE) between the two specimens was calculated using Eq. (2):
@(2)
where the parameters with the subscripts 0 and 35(70) represent the values obtained from the non-irradiated and 35(70)-kGy irradiated specimens, respectively. A larger value of ΔE implies a higher degrees of color difference between the two specimens.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Mechanical properties
As shown in Table 2, which presents the mechanical properties of the UHMWPE composites under gamma irradiation and varying Sm2O3 contents, the values of tensile modulus and hardness (Shore D) generally increased with increasing Sm2O3 content for the non-irradiated UHMWPE composites (0 kGy). These results could have been due to the high rigidity of the Sm2O3 powder (metal oxide) (Chang et al., 2014). On the other hand, the values of tensile strength and elongation at break decreased with increasing Sm2O3 contents, which could have been due to incompatibility between the Sm2O3 and UHMWPE and also the poor dispersion of Sm2O3 particles inside the UHMWPE matrix (Fang et al., 2006). As shown in Fig. 3, of which Fig. 3(a) shows the morphology of a pure UHMWPE sample and Fig. 3(b)–3(f) show the morphology of samples with increasing content of Sm2O3 powder, the SEM images clearly illustrate worsening particle dispersion and higher agglomeration of Sm2O3 particles at higher contents, especially at 50 wt%. Moreover, since the Sm2O3 powder and UHMWPE matrix had poor interfacial compatibility, visible voids occurred inside the composites, resulting in further reduction in the tensile strength and elongation at break of the Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites.

Table 2 shows the mechanical properties of the Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites under gamma irradiation with exposure doses of 35 kGy and 70 kGy. The results showed that the values of elongation at break significantly decreased, whereas the values of hardness (Shore D) increased after gamma irradiation. These results were observed due to the fact that gamma irradiation on the UHMWPE composites could induce polymer crosslinking, chain scission, and oxidative degradation on the materials, which could be confirmed using FT-IR spectra that indicated changes in the band intensities of different functional bands (Fig. 4). The FT-IR spectra indicated that higher gamma irradiation doses led to higher occurrences of chain scission as seen by the higher band intensities in the polyethylene-methylene (CH2) stretching (2695–2830 cm−1), bending (1463 cm−1), rocking vibration (720 cm−1), and alkene (Cdouble bondC) group (1600–1670 cm−1) peaks. Furthermore, higher gamma irradiation doses also led to higher oxidative degradation shown as the increase in the band intensity of the carbonyl (Cdouble bondO) group (1700–1800 cm−1). These changes/degradations led to the reduction in the length of polymer chains as well as branching and chain entanglement, resulting in increased crystallinity that generally induced higher brittleness/hardness and lower elongation at break (Dos Santos Alves et al., 2005). The values of the degree of crystallinity, which was calculated using XRD spectra (Bahrami et al., 2015) illustrated in Fig. 5 for selected composites (pure UHMWPE and 50-wt% Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites), are shown in Table 3. It was found that the degree of crystallinity increased with increasing Sm2O3 content and gamma dose, which confirmed the increase in hardness and the decrease in elongation at break of the UHMWPE composites after adding Sm2O3 powder and/or gamma irradiation. Based on Table 3, the effects of adding 50-wt% Sm2O3 to the UHMWPE composites on the degree of crystallinity were higher than the ones under 35 kGy and 70 kGy gamma irradiation.

As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 6, which show values of the L*, a*, and b* parameters and color positions in the a*-b* axes of the investigated specimens, respectively, the UHMWPE composites had significant changes in color indices (measured using UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy) after being irradiated with gamma rays at exposure doses of 35 kGy and 70 kGy. Specifically, the values of ΔE35 and ΔE70 were 2.8 and 4.6, respectively, implying larger differences in color positions at the higher gamma dose with respect to the non-irradiated specimen, that is, the composites tended to become yellower and greener (Fig. 6). This change in the color indices confirmed the FT-IR results (Fig. 4), which showed the degradation of the UHMWPE composites under gamma irradiation.

Another interesting observation on the composites under gamma irradiation was that the degradation of the samples was very much on the surface as seen by the increases in position differences (distance) between the top (facing the gamma direction) and bottom surfaces with increasing gamma doses (Fig. 6). This implied that the top surface of the composites degraded at higher rates than the bottom surface, i.e. the degradation was superficial, leading to larger position differences in the 70 kGy irradiated specimens than for the 35 kGy and non-irradiated specimens, respectively. This result was consistent with the report of Dos Santos Alves et al. (2005), which showed that the degradation of UHMWPE due to gamma irradiation was superficial at a low gamma dose (25 kGy) but occurred in the bulk of the sample at a high gamma dose (250 kGy) since the mechanism of the degradation due to gamma rays is a diffusion-controlled process, that is, the degradation depth is time-dependent (Coote et al., 2000).
3.2. Dielectric properties
Table 5, which shows the dielectric strength of UHMWPE composites, suggests that the values of dielectric strength slightly decreased as the Sm2O3 content was increased from 10 to 40 wt%. However, the dielectric strength sharply decreased when the Sm2O3 content was increased to 50 wt% because visible voids caused by the poor interfacial compatibility between the fillers and main matrix were more frequent inside the matrix with the higher Sm2O3 content (Fig. 3), leading to lower voltages needed for electrical breakdown (that is the air had much less dielectric strength than UHMWPE) and consequently there was a lowering of the overall dielectric strength of the material. The sharp decrease in the dielectric strength in the 50 wt% Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites was because the composites contained substantially more voids than the ones with lower contents, leading to the lowest dielectric strength for the 50 wt% content.
Table 5. Dielectric strength of Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites with varying Sm2O3 contents and gamma irradiation doses (values are shown as mean ± S.D.).
Sm2O3 content (wt%)	Dielectric strength (kV/mm)
Gamma dose (kGy)
0	35	70
10	46 ± 1	86 ± 3	57 ± 2
20	45 ± 1	73 ± 3	55 ± 2
30	45 ± 1	67 ± 3	55 ± 2
40	43 ± 1	46 ± 3	49 ± 2
50	35 ± 1	46 ± 2	51 ± 2
However, the dielectric strength values for the UHMWPE composites under gamma irradiation were higher than for the non-irradiated UHMWPE composites, with the highest values occurring for the 35 kGy gamma irradiation dose. This could be explained by the fact that crosslinking and crystallinity are two competing factors on the dielectric properties of the materials, with the dielectric strength increasing with increasing crosslink density but decreasing with increasing crystallinity (Maqbool et al., 2017). At lower gamma doses, the effects of crosslinking dominated the chain scission/crystallinity at the 35 kGy gamma dose, leading to initial increases in the dielectric strength. However, as the gamma irradiation dose was raised to 70 kGy, more chain scission and crystallinity occurred inside the materials (Table 3 and Fig. 4), overcoming the effect of crosslinking by reducing the overall dielectric strength of the UHMWPE composites.
3.3. Thermal neutron shielding properties
Fig. 7 and Table 6, which show neutron transmission ratios (I/I0), μ, and HVL/TVL of Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites, respectively, revealed that the neutron shielding ability of UHMWPE composites improved with increasing Sm2O3 content as seen by the decreases in I/I0 from 99% to 50%, 46%, 40%, 37%, and 34%, the increases in μ from 0.03 cm−1 to 1.45 cm−1, 1.63 cm−1, 1.91 cm−1, 2.11 cm−1, and 2.26 cm−1, the decreases in HVL values from 248 mm to 4.8 mm, 4.3 mm, 3.6 mm, 3.3 mm, and 3.1 mm, and the decreases in TVL values from 823.4 mm to 15.9 mm, 14.3 mm, 12.0 mm, 11.0 mm, and 10.3 mm, for the UHMWPE composites as the Sm2O3 contents increased from 0 to 50 wt% in 10 wt% increments, respectively. Furthermore, it could be clearly seen that the improvement was the greatest when 10 wt% Sm2O3 powder was initially introduced into the UHMWPE composites (I/I0 reduced by half). This improvement was mainly due to the high neutron absorption cross section of the samarium atoms (Sm) that enabled the composites to not only attenuate neutrons mainly through the scattering process between neutrons and hydrogen atoms (H) but also through a more efficient neutron absorption mechanism between the neutrons and Sm atoms, leading to a substantial improvement in the neutron shielding ability of the composites. The effects of the addition of Sm2O3 on the improvement of neutron shielding properties could be illustrated and explained using Fig. 8, in which Fig. 8(a) represents a pure UHMWPE sample and Fig. 8(b) represents a 10 wt% Sm2O3/UHMWPE composite. As shown in the schematic diagrams, the Sm atoms in Fig. 8(b) could absorb incoming thermal neutrons with much higher attenuation efficiency than relying purely on the scattering process between the neutrons and H atoms, resulting in less neutron transmission and better neutron shielding properties in Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites (Fig. 8(b)). However, the improvement in the ability to attenuate neutrons was less pronounced when the Sm2O3 contents were further increased to 20–50 wt%, probably because the content that maximized neutron interaction probability was already achieved at 10–20 wt% Sm2O3. In order to confirm that the recommended contents was actually at 10–20 wt%, an additional investigation on I/I0 at 5 wt% content was carried out and the result was added in Fig. 7, which revealed that the value of I/I0 at 5 wt% content was in between the values obtained from a pure UHWMPE sample and the 10 wt% Sm2O3/UHMWPE composite (I/I0 became relatively constant at higher contents), confirming that the recommended contents of Sm2O3 content was at 10–20 wt%.

Another factor that affected the neutron shielding ability of the composites was the thickness of the materials. As shown in Fig. 7, the values of I/I0 decreased with thicker Sm2O3/UHMWPE materials because more Sm as well as C and H atoms were available to interact with neutrons as the shielding material became thicker, leading to greater absorption and/or energy losses of neutrons, and consequently a higher neutron attenuation ability. The effects of the contents of neutron-absorbing fillers and the thickness of shielding materials obtained from Table 6 and Fig. 7 were consistent with other previous reports that the neutron shielding properties increased with increasing neutron-absorbing filler content and material thickness (Florez et al., 2018; Ninyong et al., 2017; Toyen and Saenboonruang, 2017; Wang et al., 2015).
4. Conclusions
This work developed thermal neutron shielding materials from Sm2O3/UHMWPE composites in which the contents of Sm2O3 varied from 0 to 50 wt% in 10 wt% increments. The results suggested that an increased Sm2O3 content led to the increases in tensile modulus, hardness (Shore D), and thermal neutron attenuation, but the decreases in tensile strength, elongation at break, and dielectric strength. In particular, after considering the thermal neutron shielding properties of the composites with various Sm2O3 contents, it was found that the contents of 10–20 wt% were the recommended contents that resulted in the composites having the highest neutron attenuating ability. Furthermore, the investigation on effects of gamma irradiation suggested that mechanical and dielectric strength of the UHMWPE composites were affected by gamma irradiation. Consequently, based on the overall experimental results in this work, it could be concluded that the developed UHMWPE composites have great potential to be used as effective and durable thermal neutron shielding materials, in which a rare earth (Sm2O3) filler acted as an effective neutron absorbent that enhanced the neutron shielding ability of the composites.
