<Section>Abstract</Section>
Thermal energy storage for nuclear power can increase the flexibility of low carbon baseload power plants and facilitate greater use of renewable energy sources. The thermodynamic performance and cost of approaches to integrate thermal energy storage with a 1050 MW nuclear power plant are compared in a parametric study over practical ranges of charge/discharge durations, peaking power and round-trip efficiency of the storage. Conceptual designs for sensible and latent heat storage modules are presented. The results quantify for the first time how different options for thermal energy storage affect technical performance of a nuclear power plant and are interpreted to identify the most efficient options and operating conditions. The three configurations are distinguished by charge and discharge operation. Configuration I charges the storage via high-pressure steam supply and discharges steam to the low-pressure turbine. Configuration II charges via high–pressure steam and discharges preheated condensate to the steam generator. Configuration IIII charges via low-pressure steam and discharges steam to a secondary Rankine cycle. The diurnal energy production ratio, or capacity factor, versus peaking power, and storage material cost are the metrics used to compare configurations. Configuration III, which does not require changes to the primary cycle turbines and thus has no detrimental impact on the efficiency of baseload operation, has the highest energy production ratio of 0.99. Energy production ratio increases as charging duration and discharge power are reduced. Configurations I and III can provide peaking power more than 1.5 times the baseload plant. Configuration II is limited to a peaking power of less than 1.1 times that of baseload and is cost effective in this range, albeit with lower energy production ratio than configuration III. Sensible heat storage in a rock bed is more economical than latent heat storage due to the relatively high cost of eutectic salt mixtures with appropriate melt temperatures.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The rapid growth of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar, can disrupt the balance utilities must sustain to provide electricity for fluctuating demand as shown by models of power grids by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory [1]. When regional penetration of wind and solar rises above 10%, VRE sources may be curtailed in favor of dispatchable energy sources such as natural gas, coal and nuclear [2]. Greater flexibility of conventional baseload power plants to respond to dynamic changes in supply and demand has been suggested as one important route to speed the expansion of solar and wind on the grid [3]. One option to increase the flexibility of baseload power plants is energy storage [4]. Of the limited energy storage deployed by utilities, the majority is pumped hydro storage. Despite the increasing need for energy storage, deployment of pumped hydro has slowed due to geographical limitations [1] and public policy barriers [5]. Batteries and the associated power electronics are gaining interest but are not yet economically attractive for widespread utility-scale use [6].
Thermal energy storage (TES) has the potential to provide utility-scale energy storage at an order of magnitude lower cost than batteries and at equivalent cost to pumped hydro [7]. Thermal energy storage can be integrated with any size thermal power plant at any location. Thermal energy is stored during periods when electricity prices are low and then the stored thermal energy is converted to electricity when electricity prices are high. According to Forsberg et al. [8] the increase in the value of electricity from nuclear power plants with storage could ensure that low carbon nuclear energy is more financially secure, reversing the trend of uneconomic operation of nuclear power plants. This economic situation is made more challenging in non-regulated markets [9]. Denholm et al. recommend TES with nuclear power to provide low carbon peaking power and predict capacity factors of nuclear with TES for hypothetical power grids [10]. The prior work does not model the impact of TES on the efficiency of the baseload plant.
In the U.S., the existing fleet of nuclear power plants was designed for constant power and, consequently, cannot rapidly control power to accommodate changes in supply or demand. Practical limits on the rate of modulation of power are <0.5% per minute [11] down to 50% of rated power [12]. The limits on flexible operation are attributed to the risk of thermal stresses induced in the fuel assembly [11]. With TES, changes in power can be accomplished without the risk of thermal stresses in the reactor. The ramp rate, or rate of change of power, is limited only by the ability to modulate the steam turbines and the rate of heat addition or extraction from the TES. Most turbines are able to change power about 7% per minute [12], with a maximum decrease of 30% of rated power. In a review of approaches to electrical energy storage, the rates of power modulation on the order of MW/min were suggested to meet the majority of requirements for time-shifting supply related to electricity pricing, and changes in supply and demand due to use of VRE [13]. Modeling of the California grid with 60% VRE penetration shows that the maximum upward ramp rate is 3142 MWe hr−1. A 1050 MWe nuclear power plant, such as the one presented in this work, able to operate with a change of power of 7% per minute is able to meet this maximum. Batteries and super capacitors can provide frequency control for which response time is on the order or seconds and storage requirements are less than 1 MWhe.
Carlson et al. [14], Carlson and Davidson [15] and Kluba and Field [16] proposed different options of integrating TES into the Rankine power cycle, and modeled the capacity factor for a fixed discharge power over single a charge/discharge cycle. As discussed in more detail in the following three paragraphs, the prior work provides sufficient data to select integration options for the present parametric study, but the prior modeling studies do not capture the technical performance of TES with nuclear over the range of operating scenarios that could be encountered in power grids, particularly with high penetration of solar and wind. Moreover, the impact of TES on the operation of the plant during baseload operation (i.e., neither charging nor discharging) was not included in the previously reported capacity factors. As demonstrated in the present work, this impact is important. The present study provides a more accurate and complete technical comparison of options for TES used with nuclear power.
In the first technical evaluation of TES with nuclear power, Carlson et al. [14] developed and applied a first law thermodynamic model of TES integrated within the primary cycle of the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear power plant (rated at 1050 MWe) [17]. In the configuration initially proposed, referred to in the present work as configuration I, the TES is charged by diverting steam exiting the steam generator to charge the TES. The stored energy is discharged to generate steam which is expanded in the low-pressure turbine (LPT). Typically, modification, as opposed to replacement, of turbines can accommodate mass flow rates up to 115% of the design point mass flow rate [18]. For a one hour charge and a full discharge, the reported capacity factor is 9.8% higher than the capacity factor for steam bypass. The capacity factor was defined as the ratio of energy generated over a cycle of charge and discharge to the energy that would have been generated in conventional operation without TES. TES will always provide higher capacity factor than will steam bypass, which is non-storage alternative for reducing baseload power.
Carlson and Davidson also considered discharging the TES to a secondary cycle, referred to in the present work as configuration III [15]. Configuration III provides the ability to scale-up discharge power without modification to the primary cycle. Charging the TES was explored using both high- and low-pressure steam. Diverting low-pressure steam yields higher capacity factors and thus the present study considers this approach. In the prior work, discharge power of the secondary cycle was constrained to 119 MWe to allow direct comparison with discharge to the primary cycle. In this case, capacity factor over a charge/discharge cycle is 15% higher than capacity factor with steam bypass.
Kluba and Field [16] modeled TES for the Korea Electric Power Corporation APR1400 nuclear power plant using the commercial software package PEPSE. The proposed option, referred to in the present work as configuration II, charges the TES using high-pressure steam like configuration I. The configuration is distinct from configuration I in the approach for discharge. The TES is discharged to preheat condensate for the steam generator, allowing steam typically used for preheating to be expanded through the high-pressure turbine (HPT) and LPT. Power during discharge is limited to ~108% of rated baseload power. The approach is similar to that proposed by Richter et al. [19] and Garbrecht et al.[20] to improve load response in coal fired power plants. Kluba and Field considered a scenario in which the TES is charged for 8 h followed by 15 h of discharge. The predicted capacity factor in this case is 81%. A comparison to steam bypass was not provided.
In the present study, three TES configurations are selected from the results of the prior work and the technical performance of these options are modeled over the wide range of operating parameters that could occur in a utility grid to support expansion of VRE. In grid operation, operating parameters, including discharge power and charge/discharge rates and duration, depend on the resource mix, consumer demand and the market regulatory structure. Given the variety of expected operating scenarios, it is critical to understand the impacts of these parameters on the capacity factor and required storage capacity and cost. The impacts of the discharge power, charge and discharge duration and round-trip efficiency of the TES on the diurnal Energy Production Ratio (EPR) versus discharge power ratio (DPR) are presented. The EPR reflects the impact of TES on the efficiency and capacity factor of the plant during charging, discharging and baseload operation. With TES, EPR is less than unity with a higher fraction representing more efficient operation of the plant and TES. The DPR is the ratio of power generated during TES discharge and the power generated in baseload without TES. The relative size and material costs for representative storage materials are presented for sensible and latent heat storage materials. The results are interpreted to suggest favorable ranges of parameters for the configurations and to compare the metrics of the three configurations in probable operating parameters.
<Section>2. Methods</Section>
Detailed configurations of TES within the AP1000 power cycle are presented in Section 2.1. The modeling approach and model formulation are presented in 2.2 Modeling approach, 2.3 Model formulation, respectively. Concepts of TES storage modules are presented in Section 2.4.
2.1. Thermal energy storage and cycle configurations
The three TES configurations are: I) TES charging via high-pressure steam supply and discharging steam to the LPT, II) TES charging via high–pressure steam and discharging preheated condensate to the steam generator, and III) TES charging via low-pressure steam and discharging steam to a secondary Rankine cycle. Fig. 1 shows operation of the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear plant with and without storage. The three configurations are differentiated by Roman numeral. Key thermodynamic state-points (SP) are labelled. Numerical values are provided for state-points that are fixed in the analysis. Operation of the baseload power plant is indicated by solid lines. Charging operation is denoted by dashed lines. Discharging is indicated by dotted lines.

2.1.1. Configuration I
Configuration I charges and discharges the TES within the primary Rankine cycle. When renewable output is high and it is desirable to reduce baseload power, steam is diverted upstream of the HPT (SP 1) at a temperature and pressure equivalent to the steam generator (271 °C and 55 Bar) to charge the TES. Energy is stored as the steam is cooled isobarically to the condenser temperature (46 °C, SP 21). The condensate is returned to the feedwater heating system via the condenser. During charging, efficiencies of the HPT and LPT are reduced as the mass flow rate to the TES is increased (commensurate with off-design operation of the turbines).
The TES is discharged using water stored at ambient temperature and pressure. The stored water is pressurized to the inlet pressure of the LPT (SP 23) and superheated to 251 °C, 20 °C cooler than steam used for charging. A temperature difference between charge and discharge is imposed to allow heat transfer to/from the storage material and the charge/discharge fluid. The flow of steam from the TES increases the mass flow rate through the LPT (SP 24). An increase of the mass flow rate up to 15% is possible via an alteration of the steam flow passage [21]. The mass flow rate through the HPT also increases, but the incremental increase is much less than for the LPT. Water is returned to storage via the condenser.
During baseload operation, the cycle is operated conventionally, but the turbines operate off-design due to modification of the design points of the turbines required for higher flow rates during discharge.
2.1.2. Configuration II
Configuration II [16] also integrates the TES within the primary Rankine cycle. Like configuration I, the TES is charged isobarically by diverting steam upstream of the HPT (SP 1) at 271 °C and 55 Bar. The temperature of condensate exiting the TES depends on the storage material. For sensible heat storage, using for example rock, the exit temperature is set to 230 °C. For latent heat storage, a mixture of 73% sodium hydroxide and 27% sodium nitrite, by molar percentage, (NaOH:NaNO2 (73:27)) is considered and has a melt temperature of 238 °C. In this case, water is assumed to exit the TES at 247 °C, which is 20 °C higher than the temperature of condensate exiting the TES during discharge.
To discharge the TES, condensate is diverted from the high-pressure feedwater heater (SP 14a) to the TES at 210 °C and 60 Bar and heated isobarically to the temperature at the inlet of the steam generator (227 °C). The discharge power of configuration II is shown to be limited to 110% of baseload.
During baseload, the cycle is operated conventionally, but the HPT and LPT both operate off-design. The penalty of off-design operation of the HPT is greater than for configuration I. The penalty of off-design operation of the LPT is similar to that for configuration I.
2.1.3. Configuration III
Configuration III is unique among the three options in that the TES is discharged to a secondary Rankine cycle. The advantage of this approach is the turbines in the primary power cycle do not require modification and do not operate off-design during baseload.
The TES is charged by diverting steam downstream of the moisture separator/reheater (SP 4) at 251 °C and 9.5 Bar. There is no change in operation of the HPT. The efficiency of the LPT decreases as the mass flow rate diverted to the TES is increased. Like configuration I, water exits the TES at 46 °C (SP 21) and is recycled to the feedwater system via the condenser.
To discharge the TES, stored condensate is pressurized (SP 23) to 5.8 Bar, heated to 231 °C and expanded in the secondary cycle steam turbine. The discharge pressure and temperature are the highest possible for the saturation temperature and pressure of steam used to charge the TES.
During baseload, the cycle is operated conventionally with no penalty due to TES.
2.2. Modeling approach
A parametric study quantifies the thermodynamic performance of configurations I, II, and III for four parameters: Discharge Power Ratio (DPR), charge duration (tC), discharge duration (tD) and round-trip efficiency of the TES (ηRT). The metric for comparison is the diurnal Energy Production Ratio (EPR), which is the ratio of energy generated over 24 h with TES and the energy that could have been generated over the same period without TES.
@(1)
The subscripts ‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘BL’ refer to charge, discharge and baseload operation with TES. The subscript ‘X,BL’ refers to baseload operation of a plant without TES.
DPR is the ratio of the net power during discharge and the net power without TES.
@(2)
Without TES, DPR = 1. With TES, DPR > 1. The DPR is varied over a wide range to capture the range that utilities might desire. There are limits to DPR for each configuration.
The round-trip efficiency (ηRT) accounts for the non-ideal behavior of the TES. It is the ratio of energy discharged to energy stored during charging.
@(3)
For an idealized TES,  = 1.
The ranges of DPR, tC, tD and ηRT listed in Table 1 span the values that might be used to support VRE generation in utility grids. The value of DPR depends on the mass flow rate through the TES during discharge (), which is selected to achieve a desired DPR. For configuration I, the DPR of the primary cycle is limited by the power rating of commercial electrical generators. The largest available electric generator based on data available from manufacturers is 2000 MWe [22]. Therefore, the maximum DPR considered is 1.9 for the AP1000, assuming an electrical generator efficiency of unity (generator efficiencies approach 99% [23]). For configuration II, DPR is limited to 1.1 by the mass flow rate of steam through the high-pressure feedwater heaters (180 kg/s). For configuration III, an upper limit of DPR = 2 is considered for a single power plant. The Westinghouse Electric Company is investigating the use of TES in future lead cooled reactors. They aim to achieve power 20% above baseload using TES (i.e., DPR = 1.2) [24]. For this reason, a DPR = 1.2 is presented as a relevant example in the results.
Table 1. Parameter Ranges.
Prior economic studies that explored the financial benefit of storage based on energy arbitrage guided the selection of the range of durations of charge and discharge. In this scenario, the TES would be charged during periods when energy prices are low (when generation capacity exceeds demand) and discharged during periods when energy prices are high (when peaking power is required). Considering a nonspecific storage type, Sioshansi et al. [25] predict a charge duration of eight hours would capture 85% of the maximum annual arbitrage value in the PJM interconnection in the eastern U.S. An energy storage round trip efficiency of 0.8 and equal rates of charge and discharge were assumed (i.e., tD = tCηRT). The analysis did not include capital or operation and maintenance costs. McConnell et al. [26] applied a similar approach to model the Australian National Energy Market. They predict 90% of the maximum annual revenue would be captured in a 4 h charge. Bradbury et al. [27] calculated the internal rate of return (IRR) for energy storage systems for eight U.S. grids and treated capital cost as a parameter. Charge and discharge rates were assumed equal. They set 10% IRR as the goal for profitability. Results indicate IRR ≥ 10% for capital costs from $5 to $100 per kWhe and charge durations up to 10 h. Cost of TES systems have been reported from $30 to $60 per kWhe [7]. Based on these economic studies, a range of charge and discharge durations from 2 to 10 h is studied.
The range of round-trip efficiencies considered is from 0.7 to an idealized maximum of unity. Factors that can affect the round-trip efficiency include the rate of thermal loss to the surroundings and heat transfer during charge and discharge of the TES. Daily thermal losses can be held to about 1% of total energy stored based observed rates in large scale high temperature sensible heat molten salt and solid concrete storage devices for concentrating solar energy [28]. Heat transfer limitations can limit charge or discharge rates which can change as charge/discharge progresses. Round-trip efficiencies of TES as high as 0.95 have been demonstrated for a 105 MWhth pilot scale sensible heat molten salt storage with concentrating solar power [29].
2.3. Model formulation
Component and system level energy balances quantify the first law thermodynamic performance of the AP1000 with and without TES. The model of configurations I [14] and III [15] is described in detail in prior publications. The model of configuration II is built into the same Matlab framework with modification for the change in operation as described in section 2.2. State-point values and turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies for the plant without TES are published values for the AP1000 [30]. The state-point values are modified for the TES configurations. The steam generator provides a thermal input of 3431 MWth, generating steam at 271 °C, 55 Bar and 1886 kg/s. The inlet temperature and pressure of the steam generator are 227 °C and 60 Bar. Other fixed values in the cycle include LPT inlet temperature (251 °C), condenser pressure (0.1 Bar) and condenser exit temperature (44 °C).
The TES is modeled as a black box with fixed inlet and outlet temperatures as described for each configuration in section 2.1. The storage capacity of the TES (QTES,C) is given by Eq. (4).
@(4)
In the parametric study, set values are the discharge mass flow rate (, charge (tC) and discharge durations (tD) and the mass flow rate to the TES during charging () is adjusted to satisfy Eq. (5).

State-point enthalpies are evaluated in Matlab using the function XSteam [31].
The net mechanical power is the sum of the power generated by the turbines minus the power to pressurize the condensate (.

Power required to pressurize the condensate in the primary and secondary cycles is
@(10)
Enthalpy of condensate exiting the feedwater pumps (hSP,out) depends on the isentropic efficiency of the pumps, which is set at ηFWP = 0.82 [30].
@(11)
Modeling of the turbines is a critical step to predict performance accurately. For TES configurations I and II, the maximum mass flow rate through the turbines is higher than in the AP1000 without TES. This change is addressed by establishing new design point pressures and mass flow rates (subscript ‘DP’) for the HPT and LPT and then adjusting turbine performance during periods of off-design (subscript ‘OD’) operation when steam flow rates are lower during charging and baseload operation. Stodola’s ellipse (Eq. (12)), also referred to as the ellipse law, is applied to calculate the pressures at the inlet and outlet of each turbine section for off-design mass flow rates.
@(12)
The ellipse law predicts turbine operation without the computational cost of a stage by stage flow calculation [32] and is accurate for as few as five stages [33]. The adjusted isentropic efficiency of the turbines (ηT) is determined using a curve fit of the estimating procedure developed by Bartlett [34].
@(13)
The assumed design point isentropic efficiency of the HPT and LPT is 0.84 [30]. The enthalpy at the outlet (hSP,out) is given by Eq. (14).
@(14)
The isentropic outlet enthalpy (hSP,out,ise) is fixed by the inlet entropy (sSP,in) and the outlet pressure (PSP). It is assumed that the turbines operate for LPT inlet values of  ≤ 1 based on the lower limit for Eq. (13) and the possibility of unstable turbines operation at  < 0.3 [18]. Turbine exit moisture is not allowed to exceed 12% (χ ≥ 0.88) to avoid erosion of the turbine rotor [35]. The extraction mass flow rates to the feedwater heaters are adjusted during baseload, charge and discharge so that the enthalpy flows at the extraction points of the turbines are the same as those of the conventional cycle without TES.
@(15)
In this expression, the subscript SP is an index for the extraction positions (SPs 9–12, 15, 16). Drain enthalpies of the high- and low-pressure feedwater heaters are held constant at conventional values [30].
The modeling process is initiated by specifying the mass flow rate through the TES () during discharge. The discharge mass flow rate establishes the DPR. Design points for all sections of the HPT and LPT are determined for configurations I and II in an iterative process. Initial estimates for the design point mass flow rates for each configuration are determined from conservation of mass across the turbine sections during discharge. For configuration I, steam is discharged to the LPT and section S3 is adjusted accordingly:
@(16)
For configuration II, the steam mass flow rate is increased in the second section of the HPT:
@(17)
Otherwise the turbine sections mass flow rates are calculated via Eqs. (18)–(24).
@(18)
@(19)
@(20)
@(21)
@(22)
@(23)
@(24)
The ellipse law (Eq. (12)) is applied to determine the design point pressures of each section of the HPT and LPT. In the first iteration, off-design mass flow rates and pressures are assumed to be the values for the AP1000 without TES given in reference [30]. The state-point values throughout the cycle are then determined from a system level energy balance applied to discharge, baseload and charge modes of operation. The convergence criteria for the energy balance is 10 kW. Isentropic efficiency for each turbine section is calculated using Eq. (13). State point enthalpies exiting the turbines are calculated using Eq. (14). Extractions to the high- and low-pressure feedwater heaters are governed by Eq. (15). Extractions to reheat the steam ( and ) upstream of the LPT are governed by Eqs. (25), (26).
@(25)
@(26)
The design point mass flow rates are updated for the turbine sections based on the results of the energy balance. The largest mass flow rate into each turbine section over the three modes of operation is the updated design mass flow rate. Design pressures are updated using the ellipse law. This iterative procedure is terminated when the residual (R) between successive determinations (index ‘j’) of design point mass flow rates is ≤ 1 kg/s.
@(27)
The residual is the sum of the absolute difference between successive iterations (subscript ‘j’) of mass flow rates through seven turbine sections. The process yields values of , DPR, , , QTES,D, QTES,C and EPR for specified values of , tC, tD, ηRT. This process is repeated for all values of , tD, tC and ηRT.
The model is validated by comparison to the model of the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear plant by Wibisino and Shwageraus [30]. Power of the turbines is within 1% of the prior work. There is no means to validated the model with TES, but we note that the present model yields nearly identical results to that of Kluba and Field [16] for configuration II.
2.4. Conceptual designs
Conceptual storage modules are illustrated in Fig. 2. Sensible and latent heat storage materials are considered. The temperatures and pressures entering and exiting the TES for each configuration are consistent with the descriptions provided in Section 2.1. Table 2 lists key thermophysical properties and specific cost ($ kg−1) of potential storage materials. The listed materials provide a basis for comparison and are not intended to be comprehensive.

Table 2. Thermophysical properties and cost of storage materials.
A single stage TES module is illustrated in Fig. 2(a) for sensible heat storage. Solid materials such as rock, sand and concrete are among the suitable materials. Concrete manufacturing accounts for about 8% of the global emission of carbon dioxide [36]. For this reason, rock is selected. The thermophysical properties of rock listed in Table 2 represent a range of types. Specific heat of rock ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 kJ kg−1 K−1 [37], [38], [39], [40]. A specific heat of 0.85 kJ kg−1 K−1 is assumed. The specific heat of most rock types are clustered within 0.8–0.9 kJ kg−1 K−1 [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Density of rock varies from 2200 kg m−3 for basalt to 2860 kg m−3 for quartzite. A density of 2600 kg m−3 is assumed. The void fraction of the rock bed (ϕ) is assumed to be 0.365, which is an idealized value for 0.02 m diameter spherical particles [42]. Cost of rock varies with type and transport distance from the source. A cost of $0.02 per kilogram for crushed rock is assumed based on cost information of [43].
A single stage latent heat storage is considered for configuration II (Fig. 2(b)) because the operating temperature range of the TES is relatively small (50 °C). The desired phase change temperature is 230 ≤ Tm ≤ 245 °C. NaOH:NaNO2 (73:27has a phase transition at 237 °C, and heat of fusion of 275 kJ kg−1 [44]. Densities and costs of eutectic salt mixtures for latent heat storage are not widely reported. Raud et al. [45] show that density of salt mixtures at the melting point can be estimated with typically less than 3% error based on mole fraction (xi).
@(28)
The density (ρi) is the density of the salt component linearly extrapolated to the melt temperature (Tm). Cost is estimated in the same manner using reported bulk cost of components.
@(29)
The estimated cost is $0.50 per kilogram based on reported cost of NaOH [46] and NaNO2 [47].
A multistage TES is considered for configurations I and III as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The conceptual design is similar to the direct steam generation TES systems for concentrating solar thermal power plants [49]. Stages are defined by (A) condensate preheating, (B) evaporation, and (C) steam superheating. Stages A and C are sensible heat storage because of the relatively wide range of operating temperature for preheating condensate and superheating steam. Stage B is latent heat storage with requirement that the storage material has phase transition temperature (Tm) between the saturation temperature of the steam used for charging and the steam generated during discharging. The isothermal, high enthalpic processes of evaporation and condensation of steam match well with latent heat storage.
During discharge, water enters stage A at the discharge pressure and temperature and is heated to the saturation temperature. Entering stage B at χ = 0 (or in the case of configuration I, χ > 0), the preheated water is evaporated and exits at χ = 1. Configuration I requires a material with 182 ≤ Tm ≤ 271 °C, a range provided by eutectic mixtures of sodium nitrate and sodium hydroxide. A mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium hydroxide with molar fractions of 0.185 and 0.815, respectively (NaNO3:NaOH (18.5:81.5)), has a phase transition at 255 °C [48], and heat of fusion of 292 kJ kg−1 [48]. Based on current bulk prices [46], [47], the cost of the mixture is $0.50 per kg. Configuration III requires a material with 157 ≤ Tm ≤ 177 °C. One candidate is an 0.5/0.5 M mixture of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide (NaOH:KOH (50:50)), which changes phase at 170 °C [44] and has a heat of fusion of 208 kJ kg−1. The cost of the mixture is $0.75 per kg based on reported bulk costs of NaOH [46] and KOH [50]. Lithium-nitrate salts have good thermophysical properties for this application but are not considered here due to high cost (> $1 per kg [51]). In stage C, the saturated vapor is heated to the turbine inlet temperature using sensible heat storage. During charging, superheated steam enters stage C. The steam is cooled, entering stage B at χ ≈ 1. In stage B, the steam is condensed, and water exits the stage slightly below the saturation temperature. In stage C, the water is cooled to the condenser temperature, 46 °C. Both discharge and charge are isobaric processes.
The volume, mass and cost of TES modules are evaluated for each configuration for tC = 4, tD = 3 h, and ηRT = 0.9 over the range of applicable DPR. The reported values do not include the cost of the container or any auxiliary equipment. The reported values are broken down into single stage (subscript ‘ss’) and multistage concepts (subscript ‘ABC’). The fraction of heat stored in each stage (fk) is determined by the change in enthalpy for the temperature, pressure and steam quality during charging as shown in Fig. 2.

<Section>3. Results</Section>
Diurnal energy production ratio (EPR) is presented first for a case study using operating scenarios, specifically charge and discharge durations, identified as economically favorable by prior analyses of the value of electricity storage in arbitrage markets in U.S. markets presented by Sioshansi et al. [25] and Bradbury et al. [27] and in the Australian wholesale market by McConnell et al. [26].In Section 3.2, EPR is presented over the full range of charge and discharge durations considered. In Section 3.3, the size and cost of TES material options are estimated and compared for representative values of DPR and charge/discharge durations.
3.1. Case study
Fig. 3 shows the diurnal EPR, which encompasses charge, discharge and baseload operation, versus DPR for two charge/discharge durations equal to tC = 4/tD = 3 h and tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. Round-trip efficiency (ηRT) of the TES is 0.9 in these plots and based on prior work on thermal storage for solar power plants [28], this value can be achieved for sensible storage at a large scale. The EPR is unity without TES (DPR = 1) and decreases with increasing DPR for all configurations and both charge/discharge durations. The decrease in EPR with increasing DPR is due to the penalty of off-design operation during charge and baseload operation. The change in the design point of the turbines becomes larger as DPR is increased. The choice of DPR in practice will depend on the economic value of providing higher peaking power and more flexible operation of the baseload power plant to improve capacity factor and increased use of VRE. The mix of generation sources and pricing in the utility grid will impact this choice. The maximum DPR is limited by the mass flow rate of steam that can be diverted to the TES during charge. The maximum rate at which TES can be charged () is set by the minimum mass flow rate through a turbine. In the present work, the minimum flow rate is set to 30% of the design point mass flow rate to avoid unstable turbine operation [18].
Fig. 3. Diurnal EPR vs DPR for tC = 4/tD = 3 and tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h and ηRT = 0.9 for configuration I (solid lines), II (dashed lines) and III (dash-dot lines). (1 column).
For configuration I, EPR versus DPR curves are identical for the single and multiple stage TES options because the inlet and outlet conditions of the TES are identical. The discussion focuses on DPR = 1.2, corresponding to the target peaking power for next generation nuclear reactors with storage set by Westinghouse [52]. At DPR = 1.2, EPR = 0.95 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h, and EPR = 0.93 for tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. The EPR is higher for shorter charge/discharge durations because the HPT and LPT operate closer to the design point mass flow rate during charging. The upper limit of DPR for the two charge/discharge durations are comparable (1.61 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h vs. 1.57 for tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h). At the respective upper limits of DPR, EPR = 0.89 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h, and EPR = 0.87 for tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. To illustrate the benefit of shorter charge/discharge cycles, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show the power during baseload () and charging () relative to the baseload power of the AP1000 without TES (). At DPR = 1.2,  = 0.96. During charging, = 0.70 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h, and = 0.67 at tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. The value of  depends on ηRT, tC and tD because these parameters determine the mass flow rate of steam diverted to the TES during charging.

Fig. 5. Normalized charging power () vs DPR for tC = 4/tD = 3 and tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h and ηRT = 0.9 for configuration I (solid lines), II (dashed lines) and III (dash-dot lines). (1 column).
Next consider configuration II. The outlet temperature of the TES is 230 °C for sensible heat storage and 247 °C for latent heat storage. This difference has a minor impact on EPR and thus the discussion focuses on lower cost sensible heat storage. At the upper limit of DPR = 1.1, EPR = 0.95 with latent heat storage and EPR = 0.96 with sensible heat storage. Kluba and Field [16] report an upper limit of DPR = 1.08 for the APR1400. The mass flow rate of steam that can be added to the HPT and LPT during discharge is limited by the mass flow rate that would have been extracted to the feedwater heaters during baseload without TES. For the range of DPR over which configuration II can be operated, EPR is slightly lower than that of configuration I because of a larger penalty on baseload operation due to more significant changes to the design points of the turbines. At DPR = 1.1,  = 0.96, compared to 0.98 for configuration I. During charge, = 0.85 for configuration II compared to 0.84 for configuration I.
Configuration III provides the highest EPR due to high efficiency during baseload and charging operation. There is no change to the design point, i.e. = 1 for all DPR. At DPR = 1.2, EPR = 0.99 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h, and EPR = 0.98 for tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. The value of  is higher than for configurations I and II because only the LPT is bypassed during charging. At DPR = 1.2, =0.80. The upper limit of DPR is 1.56 for tC = 4/tD = 3 h.
Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows the impact of round-trip efficiency of the TES on EPR for (a) tC = 4/tD = 3 h and (b) tC = 8/tD = 6.5 h. With higher round-trip efficiency EPR increases and the storage capacity (QTES,C) decreases for a specified DPR. With higher round-trip efficiency less steam must be diverted during charging and thus the turbines operate closer to the design point. The upper limit on DPR increases with increasing ηRT because the rate of discharge  is faster for the same tD. First consider tC = 4/tD = 3 h at DPR = 1.1. For configuration I, EPR increases from 0.97 to 0.98 as ηRT is increased from 0.7 to 1. The EPR of configuration II increases from 0.95 to 0.96. The EPR of configuration III increases from 0.99 to near unity. At DPR = 1.2, EPR of configuration I increases from 0.94 to 0.96, and EPR of configuration III increases from 0.98 to 0.99. For the longer charge/discharge duration, shown in Fig. 6(b), the benefit of increasing the round trip efficiency on EPR is slightly greater in terms of percent increase but the EPR is lower.
Fig. 6. EPR vs. DPR for ηRT = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 for configuration I (solid lines), II (dashed lines) and III (dash-dot lines) for (a) tC = 4/tD = 3 h and (b) tC = 8/ tD = 6.5 h. (2 column).
3.2. Effect of Charge and Discharge Durations
Fig. 7(a)–(d) shows EPR versus DPR for tC = 2, 4, 7 and 10 h, tD equal to (a) 2, (b) 4, (c) 7 and (d) 10 h and ηRT = 0.9. Fig. 8shows a subset of these data to better visualize the impact of discharge duration on EPR for (a) tC = 4 and (b) 10 h. Consistent with the results of the case study, EPR increases as charge and discharge durations are decreased for configurations I and III. The EPR for configuration II changes very little over the considered range of tC and tD. However, this configuration is distinct because the baseload operation is heavily penalized by off-design operation of the turbines. Thus, with exceptionally long charge/discharge durations, for example for tC = 8/tD = 15 h as considered by Kluba and Field [16], the EPR of configuration II is slightly higher than that of configuration I. However, long charge and discharge durations are unlikely to provide the best economic case for nuclear energy with storage. The only drawback of very short charge duration is a lower ceiling on DPR. A DPR of 1.2 can be reached for configurations I and III with charging durations as short as 2 h.
Fig. 7. Impact of charge/discharge duration: EPR vs. DPR for tD equal to (a) 2, (b) 4, (c) 7 and (d) 10 h at tC = 2, 4, 7 and 10 h. (2 column).
Fig. 8. Data from Fig. 7 replotted to emphasize the impact of discharge duration. EPR versus DPR for tD = 2,4,7 and 10 h for tC equal to (a) 4 and (b) 10 h. (2 column).
3.3. Thermal energy storage material volume and cost
Fig. 9 shows total (a) storage capacity, (b) volume, (c) mass and (d) cost of the storage material versus DPR for each configuration. The values are presented for scenarios that might be encountered in practice: tD = 3 h and ηRT = 0.9. The results are independent of the charge duration. Table 3 (single stage) and Table 4 (multistage) list the data for DPR = 1.1 and DPR = 1.2. Configuration II requires the lowest storage capacity (QTES,C) at DPR = 1.1 because ηD = 0.3 compared to ηD ≈ 0.2 for configurations I and III. For both sensible and latent heat storage, QTES,C = 950 MWhth. But configuration II is restricted to DPR ≤ 1.1. At DPR = 1.2, QTES,C is 3000 MWhth for configuration I and 3160 MWhth for configuration III. For the multistage options, stage A used for condensate preheating provides 38% of the total storage capacity for configuration I (fI,A = 0.38) and 20% for configuration III (fIII,A = 0.20). These fractions equate to 1140 MWhth and 640 MWhth at DPR = 1.2. Stage B stores the largest fraction of heat with fI,B = 0.56 and fIII,B = 0.73 corresponding to 1680 MWhth and 2310 MWhth at DPR = 1.2. Configuration III has a larger fraction of heat storage in stage B because the steam used for charging is superheated. In configuration I stage C is charged using condensing steam. Stage C provides the lowest fraction of storage capacity: fI,C = 0.06 and fIII,C = 0.07 corresponding to 180 MWhth and 210 MWhth at DPR = 1.2. Stage C is essential because superheating the steam at discharge allows for higher discharge pressures to maintain turbine outlet quality greater than 0.88.

Table 3. Single stage TES storage capacity, volume, mass and cost of storage materials for configurations I-III using sensible and latent heat storage.
Table 4. Individual stage and total TES storage capacity, volume, mass and cost of storage materials for configurations I-III.
The volume of the storage material (including the void space in the rock bed) is plotted in Fig. 9(b). Single stage options are indicated by the subscript ‘ss’. Multistage options are denoted with the subscript ‘ABC’. At DPR = 1.1, V = 82.8 (10)3 m3, 46.3 (10)3 m3and 202.7 (10)3 m3 for configurations I-III using sensible heat storage (rock). Latent heat storage can only be used in a single stage for configuration II. In this case, the total volume is reduced to 5.8 (103) m3. At DPR = 1.2, V = 169.3 (10)3 m3 and 405.4 (10)3 m3 for sensible storage for configurations I and III. The volume of the multistage concept is 23% and 80% less for configurations I and III. The percent reduction in volume is more for configuration III due the greater fraction of heat stored in latent heat in stage B than in sensible heat in stages A and C.
Based on the cost of the storage material, configuration II with rock storage is the least expensive option for DPR = 1.1. The mass of rock for configurations I, II and III is 137(106), 76(106), and 335(106) kg, respectively, with corresponding material costs of $2.73 (106), $1.53 (107) and $6.69(106). Use of NaOH:NaNO2 (73:27) in a single stage TES for configuration II reduces the mass by 85% to 12 (106) kg, but triples cost to $6.21 (106). Likewise, multistage TES modules, which combine rock and salt storage for configurations I and III, weigh less but cost more than use of rock in configuration II. At DPR = 1.2, configuration II cannot be used, but rock remains the low cost option for configurations I and III. The mass of rock in a single stage TES module is 280(106) kg for configuration I and 669 (106) kg for configuration III, double the mass at DPR = 1.1. Cost is likewise double for the higher DPR. Use of multistage TES modules at DPR = 1.2 are again more expensive due to the cost of the eutectic salt mixtures. Configuration I weighs 221 (106) kg and costs $14.34 (106) whereas configuration III weighs 149 (106) kg and costs $23.75 (106), due to the use of higher cost salts.
The storage cost per kilowatt hour electric (c) is a useful metric to compare TES with other storage technologies. As listed in Table 3, for DPR = 1.1, the single stage modules have material costs for rock of $8.69, $4.87 and $21.30 per kWhe with similar costs at higher DPR. For latent heat storage for configuration II in a single stage module, c = $19.77 per kWhe. For the multistage concepts, c = $22.35 and $38.24 per kWhe. For comparison pumped hydro storage and lithium ion batteries have reported costs of $5–100 and $600–2500 per kWhe, respectively [7].
<Section>4. Discussion</Section>
Configuration III provides the highest EPR and thus the greatest degree of flexibility for nuclear power and the expansion of renewable energy sources in the power grid. Discharge of the TES through a secondary cycle allows the primary Rankine cycle to operate at no loss of efficiency during baseload and charging operation. Configuration I and II both discharge the TES to the primary Rankine cycle and thus require enlarging the turbines, which then operate off-design and less efficiently in baseload and charging operation. At DPR = 1.2, which is the peaking power target of Westinghouse for thermal energy storage, configuration III has an EPR of 0.99 for charge duration of four hours, discharge over three hours, and ratio of discharged to charged energy of 0.9. This operating scenario has been projected to be a cost effective in economic studies of energy storage with nuclear energy in various power grids assuming an arbitrage market. In comparison, configuration I has an EPR of 0.95, which for a large power plant represents a meaningful reduction in capacity. Configuration II is restricted to DPR less than 1.1, or 10% peaking power. Like configuration I, it requires substantial changes to both the high- and low-pressure turbines. Its primary benefit is the storage volume required is lower than the other configurations, albeit to the detriment of EPR and only for low DPR.
Sensible heat storage is less expensive than latent heat storage. The narrow range of phase transition temperatures for this application limits the latent heat storage materials to relatively expensive salt mixtures, which are double the cost of rock. The only benefit of latent heat storage is a reduction of volume by up to 80%. The volume of a rock bed to provide a DPR of 1.1 for a discharge duration of three hours and TES round trip efficiency of 0.9 would be about 82.8 (103) m3, 46.3 (103) m3 and 202.7 (103) m3 for configuration I-III, respectively. To provide context, a 1000 MWe nuclear power plant typically utilizes about 75 (103) m3 of concrete for construction and the total volume of the power plant is approximately 340 (103) m3 [53]. Based on these results, configuration III with sensible heat rock storage is a promising option for additional study.
The present study applies the simplifying assumption of a conceptual TES with constant rates of charge and discharge. The cost analysis is confined to the cost of storage material. The economic tradeoff on investment rate of return between high EPR and the capital costs of adding TES and a secondary cycle is a consideration for future work as storage is planned for specific power grids. Moreover, the TES designs presented in the present study are conceptual. Detailed designs supported by transient modeling of heat transfer, with consideration of the complexities on the steam side of the TES, are a next step toward consideration of the practical (for example ramping rates and round-trip efficiency) and economic benefits of TES versus other storage options.
<Section>5. Conclusion</Section>
To guide the path toward use of thermal energy storage for utility-scale storage coupled with baseload nuclear power plants, the present study presents the first parametric study of the thermodynamic performance and cost of various approaches to integrated TES integrated with a 1050 MWe nuclear power plant. The results demonstrate how TES can be used to provide peaking power and flexibility of baseload power and still maintain reasonably high capacity factor, as quantified by the diurnal energy production ratio (EPR). Higher values of EPR are expected to correlate closely to economic viability of the TES and nuclear power plant system. The analysis considers a broad range of operating parameters to characterize how the configurations would perform in utility grids for which load management and the use of VRE sources vary. The impacts of discharge power up to twice the rated power of a conventional plant, charge and discharge durations from 2 to 10 h and round-trip efficiency of the TES from 0.7 to 1 on the diurnal Energy Production Ratio (EPR) are presented. A thermodynamic model of each TES configuration is applied to the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear power plant. The comparative results are valid for other nuclear power plants operating at similar temperatures and pressures, including the APR1400 considered by Kluba and Field [16].
The design options are distinguished by the method of charging and discharging the TES. Configuration I charges the TES using high-pressure steam and discharges steam to the LPT to provide peaking power. Configuration II charges the TES in the same way but discharges preheated condensate to the steam generator. Configuration III charges the TES using low-pressure steam and discharges to a secondary Rankine cycle. Both configuration I and II require modification to the high- and low-pressure turbines in the primary cycle to handle higher flow rates during charging.
The thermodynamic performance is storage material agnostic, but size, volume and cost of are not. Configuration III provides the highest diurnal EPR of the options considered and is the only configuration which has no detrimental impact on the efficiency of baseload operation. Configurations I and III can be operated over a wide range of discharge power. On the other hand, configuration II is limited to discharge power of 110% of baseload power. This limitation along with lower EPR is likely to restrict the economic value of this option in an arbitrage market especially for utilities with high penetration of renewable energy.
The cost of storage material is low relative to the cost of a nuclear plant but is a consideration when selecting materials and comparing TES to other storage options. The required storage capacity increases with increasing DPR, discharging duration and decreasing round-trip efficiency of the TES. A rock bed is the lowest cost material and is relatively simple compared to the multistage TES concepts that use a combination of rock and eutectic mixtures of salt. Latent heat storage materials reduce the volume and mass of the TES but at DPR = 1.2 double the material costs based on bulk pricing for eutectic salt mixtures with appropriate melt temperature. Both storage options are considerably less costly than lithium ion batteries on a per kWhe basis.
The degree to which a TES with nuclear power is economically favorable and reduces the emission of greenhouse gases will depend on grid operation, including resource mix, consumer demand and regulatory structure. The EPR versus DPR data presented here can be included in utility scale optimization models to account for the impact of TES on operation of a nuclear plant. Such an approach would provide improved predictions of internal rate of return of storage over past work which has assumed that integration of thermal storage does not impact the efficiency of the nuclear Rankine power cycle.
