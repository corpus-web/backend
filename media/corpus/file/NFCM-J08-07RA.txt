Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC) fiber–reinforced SiC matrix (SiCf/SiC) composites, employing two SiC fibers, KD-I and KD-II, respectively, were fabricated by the precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process. A pyrocarbon coating was used as the fiber-matrix interface. In addition, the effects of heat treatment on the properties of the SiC fibers and SiCf/SiC composites were investigated. Results revealed marginal performance degradation of the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers after heat treatment at 1100°C for 1 h. However, heat treatment at 1400°C for 1 h led to the decrease in the single-filament tensile strength of the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers by 50.2% and 10.1%, respectively. In addition, the flexural strength of the SiCf/SiC composites, which were fabricated using the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers, decreased by 49.6% and 15.9%, respectively. The difference in the composition of the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers demonstrated that the SiC fibers and SiCf/SiC composites decreased by varying degrees.

I. INTRODUCTION
Silicon carbide (SiC) fiber is a crucial component of SiCf/SiC composites, which demonstrate potential as candidate materials for advanced fusion energy applications because of their low induced radioactivity, rapid activity decay, and low afterheat. SiC fiber and its properties considerably affect the performance of SiCf/SiC composites. When SiC fibers are used at a temperature greater than the temperature tolerance limit, the mechanical properties of the SiC fiber deteriorate, leading to the sharp reduction in the mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composites; such deterioration of properties affects the applications of SiCf/SiC composites in nuclear fusion reactors.1–7
The SiCf/SiC composites that use the Nicalon, Hi-Nicalon, and Tyranno SiC fibers as reinforcements have been investigated worldwide.8–15 In recent years, a considerable number of studies have reported KD-I SiC fiber–reinforced SiCf/SiC composites.16–19 However, because of the high oxygen content of the KD-I SiC fibers, their performance sharply decreases at high temperature. In contrast, the oxygen content of the KD-II SiC fiber is significantly lower. Hence, the use of the KD-II SiC fiber might increase the preparation temperature of the SiCf/SiC composites.
In this study, the SiCf/SiC composites were reinforced with two SiC fibers (i.e., KD-I and KD-II, respectively) and fabricated by the precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process. A mixture of 2,4,6,8-tetravinyl–2,4,6,8-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and liquid polycarbosilane, referred to as LPVCS, was used as the ceramic liquid precursor of the SiC matrix.20,21 In addition, the effects of heat treatment on the properties of different SiC fibers and SiCf/SiC composites were evaluated by the single-filament tensile strength test, three-point bending test, and single-edge notched beam (SENB) test.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
II.A. Sample Preparation
The KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers were provided by the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT, China). Table I summarizes the properties of the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers.13 Quantitative analysis of carbon in the fibers was evaluated using a carbon and sulphur analyzer (Horiba EMGA-820, Japan), and oxygen was analyzed using an oxygen and nitrogen analyzer (Horiba EMIA-320 V2, Japan). Three-dimensional four-directional fiber preforms were braided using a four-step process. The fiber volume fraction was approximately 50% (Changzhou Bolong High Technology Co., Ltd. Jiangsu, China). The KD-I– and KD-II–SiC-braided fibers were used as reinforcements.
TABLE I General Properties of the As-Received KD-I and KD-II SiC Fibers
Prior to the PIP process, the fiber preforms were coated with the pyrocarbon (PyC) coating by using propylene as the precursor. The PyC coating was prepared at 960°C at a total pressure of 3 kPa. The carrier gas and deposition time were N2 and 3 h, respectively. The flow rates of propylene and N2 were maintained constant at 4 L · min−1 and 3 L · min−1, respectively.
The LPVCS (provided by NUDT, viscosity of 20 mPa · s at 25°C) was used as the precursor for the PIP process.2,20 The coated preform was impregnated by LPVCS by vacuum infiltration. Pressure-assisted (1 MPa) curing was applied after the first impregnation, followed by heating the preforms to 1100°C at a heating rate of 10°C · min−1 for 30 min under argon. The PIP process was repeated nine times until the weight increase of the SiCf/SiC composites was less than 1%.
The SiC fibers, the pyrolysate of the precursor, and the SiCf/SiC composites were treated at different temperatures under argon for 1 h in a Hi-Multi 5000 sinter stove.
In this study, the SiC fibers treated at different temperatures were denoted as KD-I-RT, KD-I-1100, KD-I-1400, KD-II-RT, KD-II-1100, and KD-II-1400. The pyrolysates treated at different temperatures were denoted as L-1100 and L-1400. The SiCf/SiC composites reinforced with different SiC fibers were denoted as CL-I-1100, CL-I-1400, CL-II-1100, and CL-II-1400 according to the composition. In the naming conventions, RT represents room temperature, C represents the PyC interface layer, L represents the precursor LPVCS, I refers to the KD-I SiC fiber, II represents the KD-II SiC fiber, 1100 represents the pyrolysis or heat-treatment temperature, and 1400 represents the heat-treatment temperature. Figure 1 shows the flow chart for the fabrication of the SiCf/SiC composites.

II.B. Characterization and Measurement
The bulk density and open porosity of the SiCf/SiC composites were determined by the Archimedes’ principle using kerosene as the medium according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D792-00. The powder densities of the pyrolysates from the LPVCS precursor, which were treated at different temperatures, were estimated by the quantitative volume bottle method with the same Archimedes’ principle and medium.
The single-filament tensile strength of the SiC fiber with different temperature treatments was determined by using an electronic single-fiber strength tester (Testometric Micro 350, United Kingdom). According to ASTM D3379-75, the span and test speed were 25 mm and 5 mm · min−1, respectively. In this paper, 50 specimens were tested to estimate the scatter of the single-filament tensile strength tests.
The flexural strength and fracture toughness were estimated using the three-point bending test (ASTM C1341-06) and the SENB test (ASTM E1820-11E2), respectively, which were carried out on a universal testing machine (WDW-100, China). The dimensions, span, and cross-head speed of the samples for the three-point bending test were 60 × 4 × 3 mm, 50 mm, and 0.5 mm · min−1, respectively. The size, span, notch depth, and cross-head speed of the samples for the fracture toughness test were 40 × 6 × 3 mm, 30 mm, 3 mm, and 0.05 mm · min−1, respectively. Five and three samples were used for the three-point bending teat and fracture toughness test, respectively.
The fracture morphology of the SiCf/SiC composites treated at different temperatures was observed by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S4800-II FESEM, Japan). The crystalline phases of the pyrolysates and SiC fibers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction [(XRD), Rigaku D/max-RB12, Japan]. The crystal structures of the SiC fibers (which were ground into powder) were observed by a Tecnai GF30 field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
III.A. SiC Fibers with Different Temperature Treatment
The single-filament tensile strength of the KD-I-RT was 2.03 GPa, while those of the KD-I-1100 and KD-I-1400 were 1.83 and 1.01 GPa, respectively. Compared to the KD-I-RT, the strength loss rate of the KD-I-1100 and KD-I-1400 were 9.9% and 50.2%, respectively. The single-filament tensile strength values of the KD-II-RT, KD-II-1100, and KD-II-1400 were 1.48, 1.43, and 1.33 GPa, respectively. Compared to the KD-II-RT, the loss rate of the KD-II-1100 and KD-II-1400 were 3.4% and 10.1%, respectively. With increasing treatment temperature, the SiC fiber performance mainly decreased because the gradual decomposition of the SiCxOy phase caused an increase in the number of fiber holes, and the size of microcrystalline β-SiC constantly increased.
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the two SiC fibers treated at different temperatures. Weak crystalline peaks of β-SiC revealed the amorphous nature of the KD-I-RT (Fig. 2a). Compared to the KD-I-RT, the KD-I-1100 still exhibited a typical amorphous form, and the (220) and (311) crystal planes of β-SiC were not observed. As microcrystalline β-SiC and free carbon were scattered in the SiCxOy glass phase, nucleation and growth were restrained. In contrast, the crystallinity of the KD-I-1400 was greater than those of the KD-I-RT and KD-I-1100. After heat treatment at 1400°C, the SiCxOy phase in the fiber considerably decomposed. Microcrystalline β-SiC clearly increased, and other characteristic peaks of β-SiC were observed in the XRD spectrum. Three main sharp peaks were observed at 36.5, 60.1, and 71.9 deg in the XRD spectrum of the KD-I-1400, corresponding to the (111), (220), and (311) diffraction crystal planes of β-SiC, respectively. Compared to those observed for the KD-I-RT, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) decreased and the (111) diffraction intensity increased for the KD-II-RT, revealing that the degree of crystallization for the KD-II-RT is greater than that for the KD-I-RT (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, the carbon content of the KD-II-RT was greater than that of the KD-I-RT.

The average grain sizes LC of the KD-I-1400, KD-II-RT, KD-II-1100, and KD-II-1400 were calculated from the XRD data by the analysis of the width of the (111) diffraction peak according to the well-known Scherrer equation:

The average grain size of the KD-I-1400 was 7.20 nm, while those of the KD-II-RT, KD-II-1100, and KD-II-1400 were 6.04, 5.51 and 10.32 nm, respectively. Heat treatment at 1100°C did not change the degree of crystallization for the KD-II SiC fibers. However, the LC value increased with the heat-treatment temperature increased to 1400°C.
To prepare the KD-I SiC fibers, air nonfusible treatment on polycarbosilane (PCS) must be performed after spinning, followed by the introduction of oxygen into PCS for obtaining a nonfusible fiber. Subsequently, after constant heating, the small molecular components in PCS evaporated, and side-chain −CH3 and −H dissociated with the main chain, generating free carbon. By heating at temperatures greater than 1200°C, free carbon reacted with SiCxOy, releasing CO and generating β-SiC. Meanwhile, SiCxOy decomposed and released SiO. The KD-II SiC fiber underwent PCS nonfusible treatment via electron-beam irradiation instead of air. The fiber contained low content of oxygen, and the size of the β-SiC grain was large.
Figure 3 shows the high-resolution TEM images of the two SiC fibers treated at different temperatures. The lattice parameter of microcrystalline β-SiC was 0.25 nm, corresponding to the (111) planes. The crystalline grain of the KD-II SiC fiber was clearer and greater than that of the KD-I SiC fiber. A lower number of microcrystalline structures were discretely distributed in the KD-I-1100, and the KD-I-1100 contained a large amount of Si-O-C phases. After heat treatment at 1400°C, the KD-I-1400 exhibited relatively better crystallinity and a lower number of amorphous phases. Larger-sized β-SiC crystal particles were observed in the KD-I-1400, the grain size of which was about 6 nm. The degree of crystallization for the KD-I and KD-II SiC fibers increased with the heat-treatment temperature. This result is in accordance with the XRD results shown in Fig. 2.

The larger the grain size, the lower the strength. With the increase in the microcrystalline β-SiC size, the fiber strength decreased, and free carbon exhibited quite low strength, being equivalent of fiber pores. Thus, the increase in the β-SiC number leads to the possible decrease of the fiber performance. The β-SiC grain size of the KD-I SiC fiber was less than that of the KD-II SiC fiber; thus, the single-filament tensile strength of the KD-I SiC fiber is greater than that of the KD-II SiC fiber.
III.B. Pyrolysate from LPVCS with Different Temperature Treatment
Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the L-1100 and L-1400. Broad peaks were observed at about 36 deg for the L-1100, revealing the amorphous nature of SiC. In contrast, sharp peaks were observed for the L-1400, and the FWHM of the peaks corresponding to SiC decreased. This result revealed that the average grain size of LC increases. The L-1100 contained carbon and amorphous SiC, while the L-1400 contained β-SiC with an increased degree of crystallization.

Table II summarizes the LC values and densities of the pyrolysates treated at different temperatures. The grain size of the L-1400 was 9.00 nm according to Eq. (1). This value is intermediate to those of the KD-I-1400 and KD-II-1400. With the increase in the heat-treatment temperature from 1100°C to 1400°C, the powder density of the pyrolysate increased from 2.42 to 2.51 g · cm−3. The mass retention ratio of the pyrolysate from the LPVCS was 93.2% at a heat treatment of 1400°C.

III.C. SiCf/SiC Composites with Different Temperature Treatment
Table III summarizes the densities, open porosity, mass retention ratio, flexural strength, and fracture toughness of the CL-I-1100, CL-I-1400, CL-II-1100, and CL-II-1400.
TABLE III Properties of the SiCf/SiC Composites with Different Temperature Treatments
The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the CL-I-1100 were 657.9 MPa and 29.7 MPa · m1/2, respectively. These values are optimum for four SiCf/SiC composites. However, the corresponding values of 331.9 MPa and 18.5 MPa · m1/2 for the CL-I-1400 decreased by 49.6% and 37.7%. The mechanical properties of the SiCf/SiC composites, which were reinforced with the KD-I SiC fiber, sharply decreased at a heat-treatment temperature of 1400°C, corresponding to the performance degradation of the KD-I SiC fiber. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the CL-II-1100 were 433.1 MPa and 19.4 MPa · m1/2, respectively. The corresponding values for the CL-II-1400 were 364.4 MPa and 15.7 MPa · m1/2. The flexural strength and fracture toughness retention ratio for the KD-II SiC fiber–reinforced SiCf/SiC composites (heat treated at 1400°C) were 84.1% and 80.9%, respectively. The performance degradation of the KD-II SiC fiber as well as increased porosity led to the degradation of the mechanical properties.
Figure 5 shows the typical load-displacement curves of the SiCf/SiC composites recorded during the bending tests. Four SiCf/SiC composites clearly exhibited toughened fracture behavior where the extended regions were observed after initial failure.

Figure 6 shows the fracture morphologies of the SiCf/SiC composites treated at different temperatures. Pull-out fibers were observed on the fracture surface of the composites. Residues adhering to the pull-out fibers were observed, indicative of the consumption of a considerable amount of elastic and plastic energy during failure.

Even though the crystallinity of the KD-II SiC fiber was greater than that of the KD-I SiC fiber, the composite properties were still low. The SiCxOy phase in the KD-II SiC fiber was less than that in the KD-I SiC fiber, but the high-temperature decomposition of a small amount of the SiCxOy phase in the KD-II SiC fiber led to the gradual increase of fiber holes and free carbon, as well as the grain growth of microcrystalline β-SiC in some orientation (Fig. 3). Besides, the single-filament tensile strength of the KD-II SiC fiber was less than that of the KD-I SiC fiber, which was mainly responsible for the lower mechanical properties of the SiCf/SiC composite prepared by the KD-II SiC fiber compared to the KD-I SiC fiber.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The following conclusions were made from the study:
1. The single-filament tensile strength of the KD-I-RT was greater than that of the KD-II-RT. The SiCf/SiC composites prepared at 1100°C, which were reinforced by the KD-I fibers, exhibited better mechanical properties.
2. After heat treatment at 1100°C, the tensile strength values of the KD-I and KD-II fibers decreased by 9.9% and 3.4%, respectively.
3. After heat treatment at 1400°C, the tensile strengths of the KD-I and KD-II fibers decreased by 50.2% and 10.1%, respectively. The flexural strength of the SiCf/SiC composites prepared at 1100°C and reinforced by the KD-I and KD-II fibers decreased by 49.6% and 15.9%, respectively, after undergoing heat treatment at 1400°C.
Heat treatment considerably affected the mechanical properties of the KD-I-fiber– and KD-I-fiber–reinforced SiCf/SiC composites. Future research will focus on the increase of the preparation temperature of the KD-II-fiber–reinforced SiCf/SiC composites.
