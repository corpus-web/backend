Abstract
The immobilization of radioiodine produced from reprocessing used nuclear fuel is a growing priority for research and development of nuclear waste forms. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current issues surrounding processing and containment of 129I, the isotope of greatest concern due to its long half-life of 1.6 × 107 y and potential incorporation into the human body. Strategies for disposal of radioiodine, captured by both wet scrubbing and solid sorbents, are discussed, as well as potential iodine waste streams for insertion into an immobilization process. Next, consideration of direct disposal of salts, incorporation into glasses, ceramics, cements, and other phases is discussed. The bulk of the review is devoted to an assessment of various sorbents for iodine and of waste forms described in the literature, particularly inorganic minerals, ceramics, and glasses. This review also contains recommendations for future research needed to address radioiodine immobilization materials and processes.

1. Introduction
Nuclear fuel treatment (such as reprocessing) and some nuclear accidents liberate radioactive iodine isotopes, principally 129I and 131I, into aqueous solutions and gas streams. Iodine-131 raises concerns in nuclear accidents due to its high activity (half-life, t1/2 = 8.04 d) and the potential for incorporation into the human metabolic process [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. This isotope does not pose a long-term disposal risk, because it decays to essentially zero dose (∼4.6 × 10−28 of the starting inventory) in 2 y (see Table 1). Iodine-129, on the other hand, raises concerns for used nuclear fuel (UNF) reprocessing due to its very long half-life (t1/2 = 1.6 × 107 y) and high mobility in most geological environments. In fact, 129I is consistently found to be one of the largest dose contributors in geologic repository performance assessments [6], [7], [8], despite the relatively low specific activity.

Sensitivity studies have been performed to determine the impact of iodine-containing waste forms on the projected dose to exposed individuals [7], [9]. To make a significant difference in disposal system performance, the durability of the iodine- (and/or chlorine)-containing waste form should have a fractional degradation rate lower than 10−5 y−1. In other words, if the fraction of the waste form dissolved per year is lower than 10−5, then waste form durability does not significantly affect dose to an exposed individual.
The U.S. regulations require the capture of several volatile radionuclides, namely 3H, 14C, 85Kr, and 129I, which end up in the off-gas streams in a reprocessing facility. These regulations [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] essentially require an overall plant decontamination factor (DF, see section 3 for definition) of ∼2000 for 129I, which, in practice, translates to DF targets of >3000 for the dissolver off-gas (DOG) and >1000 for vessel ventilation off-gas (VOG), cell off-gas (COG), and melter off-gas (MOG) [15], [16], [17]. Thus, it is imperative that radioiodine be captured, treated, and immobilized for safe disposal on a scale of geological time.
In this article, we update previous reviews [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] of radioiodine capture and immobilization technologies based on the significant amount of new research that has been conducted. We describe evolved technologies for radioiodine capture and treatment, the alternative processes that have been proposed for known waste forms, and new, novel immobilization forms that have been introduced. This article describes how radioiodine is released during UNF reprocessing, candidate capture and management technologies, and candidate radioiodine immobilization waste forms. Jubin and coworkers provide supplementary information [24], [25], [26].
2. Radioiodine partitioning in a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant
2.1. Iodine in UNF
Iodine isotopes make up roughly 0.69 mass% of the fission products of 235U slow-neutron fission (fractions are similar for fast-neutron fission and for 239Pu fission) or roughly 360 g of iodine per metric ton of initial uranium, assuming 50 GW-day per tonne of initial heavy metal [GWd (tIHM)−1] burn-up [15]. At the time of discharge from a reactor, 2.1% of the iodine present is 131I and minor amounts of other short-lived isotopes, but within 2 y from discharge, the only iodine isotopes remaining in significant concentrations are stable 127I (23.5%) and radioactive 129I (76.5%) (see Table 1). Between 0.8 and 6% of the iodine resides in the gap region between fuel and cladding and between fuel pellets, typically as CsI [27], while the rest resides in the UO2 matrix [27], [28] as estimated by the instantaneous release fraction for UNF contacting water.
2.2. Fate of iodine during reprocessing of UNF
During aqueous reprocessing of UNF, iodine partitions between the various gas streams and the various aqueous phases, and iodine can be released to varying degrees in almost every process within the facility. These releases become part of the off-gas streams at each of the processes, including the COG, DOG, VOG, and MOG—see Fig. 1 [24]. In commercial-scale reprocessing plants, UNF is dissolved in 3–10 M nitric acid solution at roughly 100 °C, where 94–99% of the iodine is volatilized to the DOG stream [29] leaving 1–6% of the I− in the nitric acid (DF = 17–100). Iodine speciation in the DOG is primarily I2(g) with smaller concentrations of organic iodides (e.g., CH3I, C2H5I), HI, and HOI [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Therefore, the sorbent selected for DOG treatment must be able to effectively capture both inorganic and organic iodine species. A typical DOG stream is water-saturated air containing roughly 22 ppm by mass (ppmm) [or 10 ppm by volume (ppmv)] of I2(g), 10,000 ppmm NOx, and 10 ppmm of Cl2(g) [15], [17], [36], [37], [38].
Fig. 1. Schematic of typical unit operations for an aqueous-process-based UNF reprocessing plant from Jubin et al. [24].
Some variants to the basic industrial processes that influence the partitioning of iodine include pretreating the UNF with high-temperature air, oxygen, or NOx to remove 3H and, at least partially, other volatile fission products. While pretreatment with 550 °C air to oxidize the UNF liberates about 0.1% of the iodine [17], [39], O2 pretreatment at 1200 °C removes 86–99% of the iodine [40]. Some of the iodine remains in the dissolver as insoluble colloidal solids, principally as PdI2 and AgI [31], [32], [33], [41], and while the amount of iodine tied up as these solids is reduced by bubbling NO2 through the HNO3 solution, not all is converted to I2. Some of the solids are also present as organics that are not volatilized. Results appear to be different if the analyses are performed with simulated fuel or actual fuel [32].
The remaining 1–6% of the iodine is released in the VOG, COG, and MOG. The iodine speciation in the VOG is typically higher in organic iodides (e.g., 80–90%) compared to the DOG [42], [43]. The mass concentrations of iodine in the VOG and COG are 0.1 ppm [24], [25], [33], [41], [44], [45]. Some of the iodine not evolved from the dissolver is in the form of insoluble inorganic iodides PdI2 and AgI [33], [35], [46], [47]. From the data reported in the literature, we estimated that 80–100% of the iodine not released prior to the high-level waste vitrification process will be released through volatilization during the melting process into the MOG with 0–20% incorporated in the glass during a single pass. Recycle of iodine from the off-gas system can increase the fraction immobilized in glass to between 40 and 50%.
3. Iodine capture
A number of reviews describe methods for capturing iodine from reprocessing plant off-gas streams including DOG, VOG, MOG, and COG [19], [20], [29], [36], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. It is not our intent to reiterate those reviews here, but only point out the processes to describe resulting iodine-containing streams requiring immobilization. The two general groups of iodine capture technologies are wet scrubbing and solid sorbents.
Common metrics used for describing the performance of a given sorbent are the 1) loading capacity, 2) penetration of the target species through the column (what does not get captured), 3) efficiency, and 4) DF [48]. The loading capacity is the amount of iodine that can be captured by the sorbent. The efficiency is the fraction of iodine captured, the penetration is defined in Equation (1) as the difference (the iodine that did not get captured), and the DF is defined in Equation (2) as the inverse of the penetration. In all cases, these parameters can change depending on the experimental setup where many variables can affect test results and sorbent rankings based on these metrics including (but not limited to): sorbent bed thickness, sorbent bed packing density, flow rate, target species (e.g., sorbent selectivity for different iodine species), target species concentration, and temperature.

3.1. Aqueous scrubbing options to capture iodine
In the past, many aqueous scrubbing concepts have been explored for iodine capture; these are summarized in Table 2 [21], [58], [59], [60]. They include acidic scrubbing (e.g., varying molarities of HNO3) and caustic scrubbing (CS) (e.g., NaOH, KOH). Commonly studied acidic scrubbing solutions for gaseous iodine include Mercurex [21], [58], [61], Iodox [21], [48], and electrolytic scrubbing [59], [60]. The reader is referred to previous reviews of these technologies for more information than is summarized below [21], [48], [52], [55].
Table 2. Summary of wet scrubbing methods.
3.1.1. Caustic scrubbing
Commonly studied CS solutions for gaseous iodine include those based on the disproportionation reaction shown in Equation (3). The concentration of NaOH that is used is ∼1–2 M and the products that are present in the solution are NaI, NaIO3, and perhaps NaOI. The result of this process is a liquid residue that can be disposed of as-is or can be further converted to a different form for immobilization. Of the liquid scrubbing methods, only CS is currently deployed in reprocessing plants—see Table 3 for a list of facilities that use CS as a liquid scrub method.

3.1.2. Alternative scrubbing methods
3.1.2.1. Mercurex
The Mercurex process involves 0.4 M Hg(NO3)2 and up to 14 M HNO3 solution circulated in a column. The process can be used to remove inorganic iodide as shown in Equation (4) or organic iodide as shown in Equations (5) and (6), where the products are Hg(IO3)2, HgI2, and/or HgI+. One of the drawbacks of this process is that it involves the use of Hg.
(4)6I2 + 6 Hg(NO3)2 + 6H2O ↔ 5HgI2 + Hg(IO3)2 + 12HNO3
(5)2CH3I + Hg(NO3)2 ↔ HgI2 + 2CH3NO3

3.1.2.2. Iodox
The Iodox process uses 20–23 M (hyperazeotropic) HNO3 as an acidic scrubbing solution. The primary reactions that are associated with this process are shown in Equations (7), (8), (9). The species obtained from this process is the IO3− ion, but if the nitric acid is removed through evaporation, then solid HI3O8 can be obtained.
(7)2CH3I + 4HNO3 ↔ 2CH3NO3 + I2 + N2O4 + 2H2O

(9)@
3.1.2.3. Electrolytic scrubbing
The electrolytic scrubbing process uses ∼1 M Co3+ in 8–12 M HNO3. In this process, the Co3+ is the oxidant and can be continually replenished by electrochemical methods, and this oxidizes the iodine to a nonvolatile form. Once the solution is evaporated, the result is a mixture of Co(NO3)2 and Co(IO4)2.
3.2. Solid sorbents
A summary of a range of solid sorbents for iodine are presented in Table 4 [17], [55], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], some of which are in use while others are still under development. Carbon beds such as granular activated carbon (GAC) have been used for specific applications in the absence of NOx [19]. Sharygin et al. [76], [77] have developed TiO2-based sorbents for I2(g) and CH3I. Scott et al. [62] have demonstrated graphene-based nanomaterials such as graphene powders and aerogels that have high adsorption capacities for iodine (∼50 mass%), although these remain untested in simulated reprocessing conditions. Copper metal has also been shown to be effective at removing iodine from air-gas streams, where the iodine reacts with the copper to form CuI [78].
Table 4. Summary of radioiodine solid sorbents. Note that the maximum iodine content values were not collected under like conditions and sometimes not even close to typical reprocessing off-gas conditions (e.g., room temperature).
Solid sorbents currently or recently deployed in plants include AgA, AgS, and Ag-loaded zeolite (AgZ)—see Table 3 [36], [42], [43], [53], [55], [74], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103] and literature cited above. These materials, therefore, are the iodine feeds for the immobilization processes discussed below.
3.2.1. Metal-exchanged ceramics
Metal-exchanged ceramics typically use a reactive metal with an affinity for iodine, such as Ag, to chemically combine, or chemisorb, with iodine. Other reactive metals such as Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Pd, and Tl have also been studied, but were found to be less effective than Ag at capturing iodine [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109]. Ceramics coated or impregnated with AgNO3, such as Al2O3 (sorbent referred to as AgA) [99], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115] or SiO2 (sorbent referred to as AgS) [73], [116], [117], [118], [119], [120], [121], and Ag-loaded zeolites [e.g., mordenite (AgZ) and faujasite (AgX)] [63], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130], [131] (see Fig. 2) are the most commonly applied solid sorbents for reprocessing-plant operations. The following equations represent examples of the reactions by which Ag-based sorbents are postulated to capture I2(g) or CH3I(g) to form solid AgI.
(10)3I2(g) + 6AgNO3(s) → 4AgI(s) + 2AgIO3(s) + 6NO2(g)
(11)CH3I(g) + AgNO3(s) → CH3NO3(g) + AgI(s)
(12)I2(g) + 2Ag(s) → 2AgI(s)
(13)2CH3I(g) + 2H2O(g) + 2Ag(s) → 2AgI(s) + 2CH3OH(g) + H2(g)

While pre-reducing the silver mordenite (MOR) yields a mixture of γ-AgI nanoparticles and subnanometer R-AgI, direct iodine uptake by silver-exchanged MOR produces exclusively subnanometer R-AgI.
3.2.2. Silver-functionalized silica aerogels (AgAero)
Matyáš et al. [70], [132], [133], [134] have been developing Ag-functionalized silica aerogels (AgAero) with very high Ag (and ultimately I) loadings in which the Ag is present in nanometer-sized Ag0 particles (see Fig. 3). These materials have performed very well, with high iodine capacities of ∼31 mass% following consolidation with a variety of hot-pressing techniques [135].

3.2.3. Non-oxide, chalcogen-based aerogels (chalcogels)
Riley et al. [64], [65], [66], [136], [137] have developed chalcogen-based aerogels, or chalcogels (see Fig. 4), for I2(g) capture that also have very high iodine loadings, ranging from 54.2 to 70.5 mass% of iodine [64], [65], [66], [137]. Chalcogels are made with chalcogenide clusters (e.g., Ge4S104−, Sn2S64−, SnS44−, MoS44−) interlinked with a secondary metallic species (e.g., Pt2+, Co2+, Sn2+, Sb3+) [64], [65], [136], [138], [139], [140]. The chalcogens in the chalcogel (here, it is S) are classified as weak Lewis bases and have an inherent affinity for I2(g), a weak Lewis acid [65]. This affinity has been demonstrated with many different chemistries including PtGe2S5, Sn2S3, CoMoS4, NiMoS4, CoS5, Sb4(SnS4)3, and ZnSn2S6 [64], [65], [136], [137]. In some cases, such as with Sb4Sn3S12, Sn2S3, and ZnSn2S6, the binding mechanism is thought to be mostly a chemisorption process, based on post-sorption analysis where iodide phases of SnI4 and SbI3 were found. In other cases, the binding mechanism is believed to be either a mixture of chemisorption and physisorption or a purely physisorption process.

This schematic shows the concept of incoming iodine molecules (purple) interacting with both the sulfide backbone and, in some cases, the metal interlinkers.

3.2.4. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous hybrid materials comprised of organic building blocks interlinked with metal ions. This family of materials is unique, with extremely high specific surface areas (up to ∼1 × 104 m2 g−1) [141], high compositional flexibility, and selective gas adsorptivity. In the past few years, MOFs have been evaluated for iodine capture, retention, and associated fundamental chemistry [67], [68], [69], [142]. The most commonly studied MOFs for iodine capture are the zeolitic imidazolate framework Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2 or ZIF-8 [143] and Cu3(benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate)2(H2O)3 (also called Cu-BTC or HKUST-1) [144]. The ZIF-8 and HKUST-1 MOFs have high specific surface areas of 1875 and 1798 m2 g−1, respectively, with comparable pore diameters of 11.6 and 9 Å, respectively [69]. The iodine capacities for these MOFs are high at 1.2 g g−1 for ZIF-8 [69] and 1.5–3 g g−1 for HKUST-1/Cu-BTC [67], [69]. For a schematic of how the iodine fits into the pores of a MOF, see Fig. 5 [145]. Iodine trapping using MOFs in a gas stream containing NOx and water has not yet been demonstrated.

3.3. Processes for obtaining iodine precursors for waste form processing
One of the biggest challenges facing the waste management of radioiodine is the chemical process path for converting the captured iodine into a waste form. For instance, some iodine capture matrices, particularly solid sorbents, can be directly processed into a waste form, i.e., hot-pressed AgA [75], Ag-functionalized silica aerogel [146], chalcogel [147], or possibly even AgZ [148], [149], [150], while other capture media, e.g., the mixture of Co(NO3)2 and Co(IO4)2 that comes from the electrolytic process, may require more complicated processes to achieve a viable waste form.
In other cases, interim precursor chemicals containing the iodine must be created, and possibly modified, for incorporation into a solid waste form [151]. Here, some of the intermediate iodine species have been PbI2, NaI, or AgI. It is often assumed when designing waste forms that the iodine for immobilization is in a pure salt form. The process for obtaining these intermediate iodine species is not always clearly delineated and may add significantly to the cost and risk of managing radioiodine.
Further complicating management of the iodine are the so-called “tramp” halides that enter the reprocessing system from sources other than fission, and stable halides (nonradioactive) also need to be included in the analyses given below. The sources and quantities of these halides were discussed elsewhere [15]. These halides compete for binding sites and even displace iodine from these sites [131], [152].
3.3.1. Caustic scrub
In CS, the iodine is in a dilute solution at high pH along with a wide variety of other radionuclides, tramp halides, and air constituents also at low concentrations. However, theoretically, quite high concentrations of iodine are possible in a strongly alkaline solution, if I2 is the only species in the air being scrubbed. However, other hydroxide-scrubbable species are contained in the air, such as CO2, Cl2, and NOx and these dissolve into the caustic solution. The presence of the other components can also limit the usefulness of this method for removing iodine. Operationally, these competing gas species and isotopes can be removed before the iodine, but it may be more practical to remove iodine on a solid sorbent (e.g., AgZ) before the remaining gas species are removed if the iodine is to be immobilized. Therefore, while quite high concentrations of IO3− and I− (the products of the reaction of I2 with NaOH) are possible, operationally the use of caustic might be limited. Nevertheless, this form of iodine-bearing waste can be incorporated into a number of different waste forms that accept otherwise mobile anions, including minerals, glasses, or cements.
In France (La Hague) and in the UK (Sellafield), the CS solution containing the 129I is discharged into the sea. This practice allows for isotopic dilution of the 129I with the abundance of 127I that is naturally present in the seas. Currently, this approach is not acceptable under U.S. regulations or for the Russians or Japanese.
The main challenge for developing a waste form strategy for spent caustic scrubber solutions is effectively separating the iodine and other halides from the much larger concentrations of OH− and potentially CO32− where these ions can compete for sites in some of the waste forms discussed here. Although it is theoretically possible to allow the iodine concentrations to build to quite high levels, operationally this may be quite difficult. Separation of the iodine from these caustic solutions may be needed in order to have a viable process. This is a critical consideration when assessing the viability of proposed processes, especially those involving iodine-containing liquid as reactants for mineral waste forms.
3.3.2. General iodine streams
In some cases, the iodine adsorbed on a sorbent could be selectively removed and the iodine immobilized in a separate form such as a glass. Colloidal AgI and PdI2 particles have been found in solids not dissolved in the fuel dissolver [31]. Aqueous iodide, I−(aq), could be obtained by reduction, leaving Ag(s) and I−(aq) [151], which could then be reacted with an alkali such as Na if a salt like NaI were desired as a precursor.
Alternatively, iodine could be captured by a solid sorbent, then desorbed in flowing H2 at 400–500 °C to generate HI [19], [75], [153], [154], [155], and reacted with other metals (e.g., Pb) to form intermediate products (e.g., PbI2) [48]. This gas stream can then be passed through a NaOH scrubber to remove the iodine. Reduced AgZ proved to be the most efficient iodine sorbent in laboratory studies [19], [131], [156]. In the absence of competing gas species, except for the tramp halides, quite high concentrations of iodine can be achieved. It may be possible to achieve sufficiently high iodine concentrations to use the caustic bubbler solution as the starting point for producing the immobilization form.
Although the AgI on the Ag-based solid sorbents can be thermally decomposed under H2 to liberate the iodine, the release is incomplete and the regenerated Ag-sorbent may be less useful. For example, zeolites have been reported to decompose to sodalite at temperatures ∼700 °C [157] or to an amorphous phase and then crystalline NaAlSiO4 [149]. Decomposition in H2 facilitates the reaction to form reduced Ag and liberates the iodine as HI.
Recovery of the iodine from the wet-scrubbing solutions and solid sorbents can be achieved, albeit inefficiently and with some processing complications. Iodine can be recovered from the hyperazeotropic nitric acid as iodic acid (HI3O8) after evaporating the nitric acid in which it is dissolved and filtering the precipitate [19]. It should be possible to convert the HI3O8 to a form suitable for conversion to a waste form, but this has not been studied. In the Mercurex process, the iodine reacts with a 0.2–0.4 molal Hg(NO3)2, 6–14 molal HNO3 solution (note that more dilute solutions have been used, but were found to be ineffective in removing organic iodides [19].) The iodine is recovered as Hg(IO3)2 upon conversion of the iodide, evaporation of the main solution, and filtration of the product. This product is more difficult to convert to a final waste form and involves, most likely, working with Hg(g), which is both toxic and corrosive, and mercury(II) iodate decomposes at ∼175 °C, which poses processing limitations. Burger and Scheele [158] developed an electrochemical technique to recover iodine from the Mercurex product.
4. Waste form strategies for disposal of radioiodine
Optimally, the path from the trap to the waste form should be simple and straightforward. The challenges and criteria for 129I disposal were discussed by Burger previously [159]. One limitation for waste forms in the U.S. is imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) [160] that controls the release of toxic metals into the environment including As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg, Se, and Ag. If the 129I-bearing waste form is treated as high-level waste requiring geologic disposal, the regulations that would apply to this waste form are not available, since no plans for a high-level waste repository currently exist in the U.S. The challenge, however, is to provide sufficient control to meet drinking water standards at some distance from the repository horizon.
A summary of some of the waste forms and iodine immobilization concepts in the literature is shown in Table 5 [66], [70], [72], [73], [74], [75], [161], [162], [163], [164], [165], [166], [167], [168], [169], [170], [171], [172], [173], [174], [175], [176], [177], [178]. The waste form development efforts have focused primarily on waste forms with iodide or iodate salts (e.g., AgI, PbI2, NaI, NaIO3) or the solid sorbent precursors described above. Typically, the captured iodine is further processed into a more stable compound and may further be solidified and stabilized by encapsulation in a secondary material such as a glass, ceramic, or cementitious material [75], [178], [179]. Some basic considerations for these waste form types are described below.
Table 5. Summary of candidate iodine waste forms and immobilization concepts. Note that some of these have not yet been demonstrated as waste forms. This table includes data from a previous review [164]. See Table 7 for a list of minerals not included here.
In the following sections, we have categorized proposed waste forms based on the primary matrix of the iodine. In many cases, proposals have been made to incorporate the primary matrix into a secondary matrix, such as glass, glass ceramic, or cement. Table 6 shows general processing steps required to convert the products of particular iodine capture methods to the iodine reagents needed to synthesize particular waste forms.
Table 6. Summary of general processing steps required to convert the products of particular iodine capture methods to the iodine reagents needed to synthesize selected waste forms. The most direct pathway for each material is shown in bold; these are processes that do not require changes in iodine oxidation state (an energy intensive step) and require only one or two other reaction steps.
4.1. Consolidation options
In many cases, the used iodine sorbent is not a suitable waste form in itself and requires some form of consolidation, which is often accomplished with heating, where a force can also be applied to aid the process of pore collapse. A good example of this is with the aerogel sorbents, which have high surface areas. Common consolidation techniques used for waste form collapse include (but are not limited to) hot isostatic pressing (HIP), hot uniaxial pressing (HUP), spark plasma sintering (SPS), microwave sintering, cold pressing and sintering, and direct melting. Also, sometimes the iodine-containing waste form phase requires a secondary phase for encapsulation.
For HIP, the material to be consolidated is placed inside a can, often made of stainless steel, Cu, or Ni. Here, the loaded can (waste form precursors plus the can material) is heated under high pressure of a filler gas, e.g., Ar, and the can collapses isostatically under the pressure. This collapse, the effects of which are shown in Fig. 6, helps remove open porosity in the material. It is important that the can be composed of a material that is compatible with the waste form so that the can is not compromised during the heating process.

For HUP, the material is placed inside a die and uniaxially pressed with a ramrod at elevated temperature. The ram pressure can be adjusted with heating or kept constant, depending on the material that is being consolidated. This approach is not ideal for waste forms that liquefy at heat treatment temperatures because they could be extruded from the die.
For SPS, the approach is similar to HUP, but the material is usually placed inside a graphite die and a direct current is pulsed through the die while pressure is applied. This approach results in much faster heating rates than HUP or HIP of up to ∼1000 °C/min. This can be done in an inert atmosphere, which is a requirement for air-sensitive samples that could undergo oxidation.
For microwave sintering, heating is achieved as the microwaves couple to the material. The concomitant absorption of the microwave energy gives rise to rapid heating of the materials [180]. Usually, however, the heating starts at the core of the material and moves outward. Depending on the microwave power, this heating is rapid and consolidation occurs from the inside outwards, thereby minimizing thermal stresses in the consolidating material. As with other forms of consolidation, an inert atmosphere can be used to help prevent oxidation of air-sensitive materials.
For the cold-press-and-sinter method, the material is first pressed in some form, e.g., uniaxially or isostatically, and then heated separately with no pressure applied. This method has the greatest risk for iodine volatilization during heating. This method is a more flexible option that does not require a single instrument to do both the pressing and the heating. The die used does not have to be thermally compatible with the waste form material as it does with the aforementioned techniques. Cold-press-and-sinter is commonly applied to fabrication of UOx and MOx fuel and thus has been demonstrated for relevant applications with nuclear environmental safety and health as well as quality assurance requirements.
In the direct melting approach, the precursors for the waste form fabrication are simply melted together. This is the typical approach for making a glass waste form. The glass is melted in a crucible that is composed of a material compatible with the waste form. The melting process can be performed directly within the can used as the material container, or in a separate vessel after which the material is poured into the waste form container.
Each approach has advantages and disadvantages for different wastes. The most important aspects of any consolidation process are that the radionuclides of interest are retained in the final product and sufficient secondary capture mechanisms are used during processing to manage any released radionuclides. In this regard, HIP is an attractive option because the entire consolidation process is done in a sealed container, so the iodine is retained unless the fidelity of the can is compromised during heating (note that iodine may be lost during vacuum drying of the material prior to HIP).
4.2. Direct disposal of iodide or iodate salts
Direct disposal of iodide (i.e., AgI, PbI2, CuI, and HgI2) and iodate [i.e., Cu(IO3)2, Ca(IO3)2, and Ba(IO3)2] minerals was discussed by Taylor [22] and Burger et al. [18]. Based on these studies, the most stable of all iodide compounds across a majority of chemical environments, including cement pore water solution, is AgI. This is not surprising, considering that AgI, known as iodargyrite or iodyrite, is the only significant terrestrial mineral source of iodine, while most iodine is present in seawater [181]. Iodargyrite is a rare mineral, but is found on earth and in meteors [182].
Srinivasan et al. [182] compared the 129I/127I ratio from two iodargyrite samples from the Broken Hill deposit in Australia, a metamorphic deposit dating from ∼5 × 108–1.7 × 109 y BCE. The age of these samples and their formation mechanism indicate that AgI is geologically stable. The climate at Broken Hill appears to have been arid over the past 6 × 107 y or more. This suggests that AgI might be a good natural analog for an iodine waste form.
Inagaki et al. [183] provide further evidence of the promise for AgI. They studied the dissolution rate of AgI in reducing environments with the presence of FeCl2 in dilute flow-through conditions and found that the dissolution of AgI was controlled by a redox reaction with Fe2+ that formed an Ag0 passivation layer over the AgI particles and kinetically delayed dissolution.
However, AgI is relatively soluble in the acetate solution that is used in the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) [184]. The solubility of silver acetate is 0.062 M or 6.7 g Ag L−1 [185]. Therefore, AgI would not pass the EPA standards for land disposal (as was confirmed for radioiodine-loaded AgZ, or AgZI, with a resulting Ag concentration of 125 mg L−1 [178], [186]) and would require further treatment prior to disposal in a non-RCRA-licensed facility [160]. Elemental silver meets the RCRA standard, however [187], [188]. Scheele demonstrated that immobilization of AgZI in standard calcium alumino-silicate-hydrate (CASH) cement along with nonradioactive CaI2 was an effective means of meeting U.S. hazardous waste regulations [178]. A secondary benefit of the use of CaI2 to control Ag release is the isotopic dilution of 129I should iodine be released.
4.3. Glass
Iodine incorporation into glass has been investigated for many different purposes, including applications ranging from optical materials to batteries to nuclear waste immobilization. Each study in the literature used either elemental iodine or solid iodine compounds during preparation. The primary oxide glass systems that have been studied for glass formation with iodine or iodine-containing compounds are borosilicate [151], silver oxide [189], [190], [191], [192], [193], [194], [195], [196], [197], phosphate [191], [197], [198], [199], and lead [175], [200] glasses. When put into oxide glasses, iodine is thought to enter the glass network in place of other ions such as oxygen, but in some cases, the iodine appears to occupy interstitial sites in the glass network [201]. In contrast, a large portion of literature on iodine-containing glasses has focused on non-oxide, chalcogen (Ch)-containing compounds with S2−, Se2−, and/or Te2− as the anions and As3+, Ge4+, P5+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ as the cations, as well as other mixed-cation halides.
4.3.1. Borosilicate glass
In typical borosilicate waste glasses, the solubility of iodine is thought to be very low (i.e., <2 mass%) but this can be attributed to low retention of iodine during the melting process [176], [202] posing processing limitations for making glasses with high iodine content. In a paper study, Hrma [202] reported that iodine segregates from low-activity waste (LAW) glasses and forms I2(g) bubbles that rise to the melt surface and burst. Another limitation for incorporating iodine into LAW glass is that the iodine tends to evaporate off the melt surface during processing.
The difficulty in determining the solubility of iodine in LAW borosilicate glass prompted a study by Riley et al. [176]. In this study, the solubility of iodine in a LAW glass and was determined to be ∼1 mass% using a nontraditional experimental approach for oxide glasses. In these experiments, iodine was added at different concentrations in the form of NaI to a LAW simulant, the mixture was placed inside a fused-quartz tube, and the tube was evacuated and then sealed. Melting experiments were conducted at 1000 °C for 2 h. The aim of this study was to keep the iodine that volatilized out of the melt within the headspace above the melt and in contact with the melt surface. At iodide additions above the solubility limit, inclusions of iodosodalite [Na8(AlSiO4)6I2] were found within the glass. At concentrations above 1.2 mass%, a low viscosity phase was observed on the top of the melt during cooling that solidified into a salt layer rich in NaI, Na2SO4, and KI. This study was only conducted for a single LAW glass composition.
4.3.2. Silver oxide glass
Silver iodide forms a stable glass with Ag2O and thus provides a potential option for solidification and stabilization of AgI. A large portion of AgI glasses in the literature are Ag2O–AgI compositions that contain a variety of other components such as B2O3 [189], [190], [192], [194], MoO3 [191], [192], [193], [194], P2O5 [191], [194], [195], [197], As2O5 [194], and/or WO3 [191], [196]. Large fractions of AgI can be incorporated in these glasses (up to ∼75 mass%), where processing temperatures vary with composition. In a study by Minami et al. [194], the following processing temperatures were used during melting in quartz crucibles: B2O3 (600–800 °C), MoO3 (500 °C), P2O5 (450–500 °C), and As2O5 (500–600 °C). The different processing temperatures of these ternary systems reveal the flexibility of the Ag2O–AgI glasses to reduce temperature if AgI volatility is encountered during the consolidation process. Dalba et al. [189] and Rocca et al. [190], [203] looked at the series of glasses in the ternary (AgI)x(Ag2O·nB2O3)1−x, and in the glass with n = 4 and x = 0.55 (AgI = 29.5 mass%) they found no medium-range order of AgI clusters, suggesting good homogeneity and dissolution of AgI in the glass.
4.3.3. Phosphate glass
Yang et al. [199] investigated low-melting glasses for immobilizing AgI in the (P2O5)x-(Bi2O3)y-(ZnO)z ternary system where x = 50–90%, y = 10–50%, and z = 0–40% by mole. In this study, AgI was added to the glasses at a loading of 25 mass%. This study showed that AgI could be successfully encapsulated in the glass without serious loss of iodine at 600–650 °C in these systems.
Presumably, the iron phosphate glasses studied for waste vitrification of difficult wastes (high in alkali, halides, and sulfate [204], [205]), would also be suitable for high iodine concentrations. Phosphates deserve further study, particularly since their chemistry can be tailored to be similar to some target mineral forms for iodine including the mineral apatite [e.g., Ca5(PO4)3(I,IO3), Pb10(VO4)x(PO4)6−xI2], which is discussed later. However, initial attempts to immobilize chlorides in iron phosphate glasses resulted in high loss of the chlorine due to volatility in crucible-scale melting tests [204], [206].
4.3.4. Lead glass
By ion exchange of I− for NO3− in BiPbO2NO3, Mukonoki et al. [175], [200] prepared BiPbO2I that can be solidified and stabilized in a glass with a low melting temperature. These glasses had compositions 65%PbO–30%B2O3–5%ZnO or 66.7%PbO–33.3%B2O3 (by mass) and melted at ∼520 °C.
4.3.5. Chalcogenide glass
Non-oxide chalcogenide (Ch = S, Se, and/or Te) glasses can accommodate more iodine in their network than any other type of glass, and thus are one of the most prevalent types of iodine-containing glasses studied to date. The Ge-Ch [207], [208], As-Ch [209], and Sb-Ch [210] glass systems have all been demonstrated as hosts for iodine, and glass systems such as As-Ag-Ch [198], As-Ch [211], As-Ge-Ch [212], [213], Zn-Ge-Ch [214], and Sb-Ag-Ch [215] have been demonstrated as hosts for AgI. The affinity of chalcogenide systems for iodine is the principal reason for considering them as sorbents using chalcogels, as described previously. No attempts have been made to produce these glasses at scales relevant for waste form processing, and contact with air (resulting in oxidation) or volatility during melting may be a concern in a large-scale process, whereas these concerns can be mitigated at a small laboratory scale by melting in sealed or lidded crucibles [209]. The option to consolidate in a closed system such as with HIP to control iodine volatility is a possibility [216]. While this family of glasses shows some promise as a waste form, little is known about the properties of these materials pertaining to the chemical durability. It is known that chalcogenide glasses are soluble in caustic solutions and tend to be rather insoluble in acidic conditions [217], [218].
A unique aspect of the chemistry of these materials is that they can also be engineered as sorbents. Chalcogels, discussed in Section 3.2.3, are currently being developed as sorbents for various types of environmental contaminants including I2(g) [64], [65], [136], [137]. The caveat is that chalcogels are untested in simulated nuclear waste process streams containing all of the potential forms of iodine that might be present in the process gases.
4.4. Glass ceramics
In the previous sections on glass waste forms, it is assumed that the iodine is dissolved in the amorphous glass network and not present in crystalline phases. In contrast, glass ceramics, which are sometimes called glass composites or glass composite materials (GCMs), are materials where crystalline species are contained within a glassy matrix. These are formed by either co-sintering a ceramic and glass phase or by cooling a melt so that selective phases crystallize [219]. Recently, glass-ceramic nuclear waste forms have been considered where the crystalline phases are formed upon cooling from the melt [220], although this approach has not yet been demonstrated for iodine-containing crystalline phases.
Glass ceramics can also be formed by mixing an iodine-containing mineral, such as AgI, apatite, sodalite, or BiPbO2I, with a glass binder and heating at sufficiently low temperature that the mineral is not destroyed by reaction with the matrix, thermal decomposition, or volatilization [e.g., AgI(g)], but rather minerals are fused together within an encompassing glass matrix. For iodine minerals considered thus far, these “sintering glasses” contain ZnO, PbO, or Bi2O3 along with B2O3 or SiO2 [75], [221], [222]. This method is the basis for the glass-bonded sodalite waste form for immobilizing the mixed chlorides from an electrochemical approach for reprocessing UNF (which contain most of the fission-product iodine) [223], [224]. In this application, the glass binder also immobilizes some of the radionuclides that do not fit into the sodalite crystal structure [223], [224], [225]. Including a glass binder is very effective at closing the porosity in sintered materials, noticeably improves yield of targeted crystalline phases, and improves leach resistance by reducing accessible porosity [226], [227].
One challenge associated with glass ceramics or GCMs is identifying a chemically compatible glass binder for the particular mineral(s) of interest. For sodalite waste forms, sodium borosilicate glasses have been evaluated [228], [229] that showed successful densification of the material. Donald et al. [227] provided a summary of various sodium aluminophosphate glass binders for apatite-based minerals that worked well at densifying these formulations.
Nenoff and colleagues have developed a GCM for the immobilization of AgZI [221], [230], [231], [232], [233], [234], [235]. In order to fabricate this waste form, the AgZI media was removed from the absorber cartridge, ground, mixed with a powdered bismuth zinc aluminosilicate glass frit and sintered at 550 °C into a final glass-ceramic waste form. A mixture of 74.2% frit, 24.7% AgZI, and 1.1% Ag metal flakes (by mass) was blended and the mixture was uniaxially pressed at ∼70 MPa. The iodine leach resistance of this product was measured with single-pass flow-through methods under dilute conditions [236]. The normalized iodine release rate of the GCM was <1 × 10−5 g m−2 d−1 at 25 °C at both pH = 3 and pH = 8. The Bi–Si-glass dissolved at rates similar to, and possibly lower than, traditional nuclear waste glasses [236].
As with AgZ, aerogels can act as precursors to the final waste form matrix in which the waste is actually immobilized [237]. The porous network of silica aerogel has been used as a host matrix for nuclear wastes [238], where the silica aerogel was soaked in a solution containing actinide nitrates and, after drying and nitrate decomposition, the aerogel was fully sintered, with the actinides becoming bound within the aerogel matrix creating a GCM.
The AgAero iodine sorbents under development by Matyáš et al. [70], [132], [133], [134] are similar to AgZ in that both have a porous oxide scaffold with Ag0 binding sites for iodine. However, the advantage to Ag-functionalized silica aerogel is direct consolidation to a fused silica-based waste form with encapsulated AgI nanoparticles. Fresh AgAero has a capacity of roughly 45 mass% I2. However, with use, aging may reduce the capacity; in laboratory tests the decrease was about 22 mass%. Densification with HUP at temperatures as low as 1050 °C was demonstrated, with iodine retention of >92% and densities as high as 2.2 × 103 kg m−3.
4.5. Ceramic composites
A ceramic composite for the immobilization of 129I was reported by Watanabe and coworkers [239]. This composite was made by sorbing aqueous I− onto a Ca-exchanged Na-zeolite A. This material contained no Ag. The Ca-zeolite A was then contacted with I2(g) until saturated. The resulting powder was coated with a nanolayer of hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] in an aqueous solution at 80 °C. This mixture was then combined with hydroxyfluorapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F)2] in a ratio of 15 mass% iodine-loaded zeolite A (with the nanolayer of hydroxyapatite) to 85 mass% Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F)2. This mixture was cold-pressed and sintered using pulsed electric current sintering [240] at 950 °C. Alone, the I2-loaded Ca-zeolite lost I2 over a temperature range from 227 to 327 °C. With the hydroxyapatite coating, the loss of I2 was delayed to the temperature range of 1027 to 1227 °C [239]. Mixing the hydroxyapatite-coated I-Ca-zeolite A with Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F)2 yielded a composite with 98% of theoretical density in which more than 99% of the iodine was retained. A static leach test was performed with a specimen surface-to-solution volume of 1 m−1 in deaerated water and under an Ar atmosphere for 56 d. Test results showed that about 5% of the iodine was leached.
4.6. Cement
Cementitious waste forms have long been used for immobilizing hazardous and intermediate-level [241], [242], [243] and LAW nuclear wastes [244], [245], [246]. A good summary of the older results of iodine in cement waste forms is provided by Pierce et al. [247]. Iodine can be captured in some crystalline cement phases including ettringinte [(Ca3(Al,Fe)(OH)6·12H2O)2·(SO4)3·nH2O] and calcium monosulfate [Ca2(Al,Fe)(OH)6)(SO4)·nH2O], where the IO3− or I− can substitute in for OH−, SO42−, or CO32− [75], [248]. The process outlined by Tanabe et al. [75] in Fig. 7 provides an example of how cement can be made with I− and/or IO3− ions removed from the spent filter through a Na2S reduction process followed by filtration.
Fig. 7. High-performance cement solidification process for 129I from AgA [75].
It is also possible to directly encapsulate a previously generated iodine mineral into a cement blend, such as AgI and (Ba,Ca,Sr,Hg)IO3 in Portland type III cement [18]. Getters can be added to mixed alkali and anion liquid wastes to aid in immobilizing iodine. Materials considered as getters for iodine in cement have included: layered bismuth hydroxides, argentite (Ag2S), Ag-impregnated carbon, and Ag-zeolites [247], with the most effective getters being synthetic argentite and Ag-zeolite [249].
Alternatively, once iodine is captured within porous Ag-functionalized media such as AgZ, it can be further encapsulated into cement. Encapsulation of AgZI in cement was proposed by Burger et al. [18]. In dynamic leach tests, they found that the AgZI-containing cement was more than an order of magnitude more durable than cement with an equivalent iodine loading and also containing Ba(IO3)2, while the rates were roughly equivalent for static tests. Trevorrow et al. [21] estimate the lifetime of cemented AgZI to be on the order of 104 years (assuming monolithic cement in standard 208 L or 55 gallon drums).
One of the challenges with all potential iodine disposal strategies is whether the waste form also satisfies hazardous waste RCRA and local disposal requirements for constituents such as Ag. In studies to determine whether cement encapsulation of AgZI satisfied RCRA hazardous waste regulations, Scheele et al. [178], [186] compared the silver TCLP responses of AgZI (125 mg L−1) with grouted AgZI (<0.006 mg L−1). These were based on a Portland type III cement mixture fabricated with 51% cement, 25% AgZI, and 24% H2O (by mass). Since no cemented waste satisfied RCRA requirements, CaI2 was added to control Ag releases. A cement formulation of 21% H2O, 44% cement, 26% AgZI, and 11% CaI2 (by mass) was proposed as the final waste form.
4.7. Inorganic minerals and ceramics
Some of the natural minerals known to incorporate I− and/or IO3−, and thus act as potential iodine disposal forms, are summarized in Table 7 [18], [21], [148], [163], [183], [227], [250], [251], [252], [253], [254], [255], [256], [257], [258], [259], [260], [261], [262], [263], [264], [265], [266], [267], [268], [269], [270], [271]. Here, the general molecular formula is provided for the various mineral forms along with the calculated stoichiometric loading limits for iodine and/or iodide species.
Table 7. Summary of potential or deployed natural mineral waste form options for I− and IO3−, listed in descending order (by mineral type) by iodine loading limit.
4.7.1. Methods for incorporating ions into minerals
A few general methods for making synthetic minerals have been described in the literature, and processes that have been considered for incorporating one halide (e.g., Cl−) have potential for being considered for I− or other iodine species (e.g., IO3−). For example, when considering sodalite, four such methods discussed in the literature include (1) high-temperature structural conversion of zeolite (or other aluminosilicate) and salt into sodalite [272], (2) solution-based (wet chemical) processing at atmospheric pressure and room or slightly elevated temperatures [226], [253], (3) hydrothermal processing, where reactants are mixed in water and heated at moderate temperatures (<200 °C) under pressure in an autoclave [273], and (4) sol–gel processing, where polycondensation reactions result in an interlinked network within a solvent matrix [228], [274].
4.7.2. Titanate ceramics
The consolidation methods typically proposed for producing monolithic ceramic iodine-containing waste forms are HUP, HIP, and SPS. These methods have been used previously for ceramic waste forms such as Synroc [275], [276]. Synroc is a synthetic crystalline ceramic composed of titanate minerals that are thermodynamically stable in a natural environment. The primary minerals found in these materials are Ba-hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7), and perovskite (CaTiO3) [277]. Vance and Hartman [278] demonstrated that substantial quantities of iodine can be retained in Synroc-C, although it might be present metal iodides, e.g., AgI, CrI3, and PdI2. Also, HIP processing of the Ag-alumina iodine sorbent [75] and AgI in TiO2 [151] have been reported.
4.7.3. Sodalite
One mineral that can accommodate iodine in its atomic structure and can be easily synthesized at low temperature (≤200 °C) is iodosodalite, Na8(AlSiO4)6I2, shown in Fig. 8 [148], [260], [279], [280]. Although natural sodalite contains only trace quantities of iodine [22], synthetic versions have been produced with I− or IO3− in the β-cage of the sodalite structure [148], [260], [279], [280], [281]. Glass-bonded chlorosodalite [Na8(AlSiO4)6Cl2] has been proposed as the baseline waste form for the chloride-containing spent electrochemical salt waste generated as a part of the electrochemical separation process of spent breeder reactor fuels, as previously mentioned [223], [224]. On the other hand, iodosodalite has received far less attention for its potential application as a host for 129I immobilization and mixed halide wastes including iodides. Early studies on iodosodalite waste forms investigated cold pressing and sintering or vacuum hot-pressing methods [260], [282], [283].
Fig. 8. (a) Drawing of the sodalite cage containing NaI. For clarity, oxygen is not shown (the small gray atoms are Al in the background). (b) Structural arrangement of four interconnected sodalite β-cages.
High-temperature structural conversion of zeolite to iodosodalite involves mixing an iodide or iodate salt (e.g., NaI) with zeolite 4A, and then heating the mixture at ∼900 °C [149], [284]. The synthesis of glass-bonded chlorosodalite involves a similar process with an added glass binder to form a final monolithic waste form [223], [285]. These high-temperature synthesis routes may not be preferred for waste form processing of iodine due to its high volatility.
Solution-based sodalite synthesis methods offer some distinct advantages, such as low-temperature processes, mitigation of volatility concerns, and the potentially higher degree of homogeneity achieved in aqueous solutions. Most of the studies focused on the synthesis of chlorosodalite or iodosodalite involve reacting a mixture of NaAlO2 + alkali halide (e.g., NaCl, NaI or NaIO3) with colloidal SiO2, either in water or in alkaline solution (by adding NaOH in order to improve the solubility of reaction precursors) at temperatures <100 °C, followed by pressing them either with or without glass binders, and firing at <900 °C to produce a glass-bonded ceramic waste form [226], [229], [253], [286]. These solution-based processes, with and without NaOH, are attractive for iodine waste forms due to their low-temperature processing conditions.
Hydrothermal synthesis of halide-containing sodalite involves heating the mixture of alkali halide, NaOH, SiO2, and alumina source [e.g., NaAlO2, Al2Si2O5(OH)4, Al2Si2O7, NaAlSiO4, or aluminosilicate gel] at ∼200 °C for varying times followed by washing to remove excess NaOH and any unreacted iodide salt [148], [262], [279]. It is noteworthy that sodalite is normally produced in an excess of halide to prevent competition with OH– in solution. The hydrothermal reaction is an attractive alternative because it produces high quality crystalline sodalite without the subsequent heating that is required in the solution-based process. However, hydrothermal preparative schemes typically result in a powdered material that would need to be further consolidated if it is to be a viable waste form for a high-level waste repository.
The chemical durability of iodosodalite has been measured on several occasions. Burger et al. [18] found iodine release rates from sodalite to be comparable to AgI in cement in a static leach test. In a separate study by Maddrell and Abraitis [151], it was concluded that the bulk matrix dissolution of iodovanadinite was higher than good quality iodosodalite and that the iodine losses from iodovanadinite were significantly higher due to an apparent ion exchange leaching mechanism [151].
4.7.4. Cancrinite
The general formula for cancrinite is Na6Ca2[AlSiO4]6(CO3)2·2H2O, and thus it is similar to sodalite but tends to have calcium substitution for some of the alkali and the cage often contains CO32− ions. Additionally, whereas the anion in the natural mineral is nominally carbonate, it has been shown that other anions can occupy the cage, such as Cl− for the quadridavyne structure [253]. Although natural cancrinite is not known to contain I−, Nenoff et al. [287] synthesized cancrinite using NaOH with I− and IO3− plus kaolinite clay heated hydrothermally at 90 °C for several days. Their studies found that both I− and IO3− were incorporated into cancrinite.
Waste forms for high sodium caustic wastes often form cancrinite in addition to other phases [288], [289], [290], [291]. Cancrinite is also known to form as a secondary mineral when caustic waste solutions react with sediments [292], [293], [294], [295], [296], [297]. Thus, this mineral could be considered for immobilization of CS wastes that include iodine species.
4.7.5. Silver zeolite (AgZ)
Hot isostatic pressing of iodine-loaded AgZ has been investigated by Jubin and coworkers [24], [161], [298]. They examined both as-received AgZ extrudates (the form in which the AgZ is used in an iodine trap) and powdered AgZI. Both routes gave the same results in terms of density (i.e., closed porosity) with iodine loadings of 10–12 mass%, indicating that the process would be effective for moving the iodine-loaded AgZ directly from the iodine trap column to a HIP can for consolidation without the addition of any other material for aiding the densification process. Chemical durability tests were not yet performed as of the writing of this document.
4.7.6. Apatite: calcium phosphates (CaP)
Calcium phosphate (CaP)-apatite has mainly been explored for immobilization of fluoride- and chloride-rich waste streams, but also has potential for iodine immobilization. An apatite, with the general formula Ca5(PO4)3X (X = OH, F, Cl, I), can accommodate halide anions as well as cations of various valences (including actinides and fission products) in its crystal structure [299]. CaP-apatite can be synthesized at low temperatures and has better chemical durability than other apatite compositions (e.g., iodovanadinite apatite) making it an attractive waste form candidate [227]. The CaP-apatites have not received much attention as hosts for 129I immobilization, due to the general perception that iodine does not incorporate into the crystal structure because of its larger ionic size. Probably due to this perception, little has been published on the synthesis of CaP-based iodo-oxyapatite [Ca15(PO4)9(IO), shown in Fig. 9] or iodo-apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(I,IO3)] [263], [264], [265]. In the few preliminary studies available in the literature, it has been established that it is possible to synthesize iodo-apatite near room temperature and that there exists a series of solid solutions between hydroxyapatite, ideally Ca5(PO4)3OH, and iodo-apatite where OH− is replaced by I−. Henning [264] synthesized iodo-oxyapatite [Ca15(PO4)9IO] through a flux method by heating a mixture of CaO, Ca3(PO4)2, and an excess of CaI2 at 850 °C in a platinum crucible sealed in an evacuated quartz tube.

Low-temperature synthesis of iodine-containing CaP-apatite was first demonstrated by Phebe and Narasaraju [265], where an aqueous solution of (NH4)2HPO4 was added dropwise to a mixture of aqueous Ca(NO3)2 and KI at pH ∼ 12 (created by adding ethylenediamine) in a CO2-free atmosphere (to prevent the formation of carbonated apatite) followed by repeated washing, drying and heating at 600 °C for 6 h. The resulting material was a solid solution, i.e., Ca10(PO4)6(OH,I)2.
Campayo et al. [263] modified the Phebe and Narasaraju [265] synthesis route to precipitate IO3−-substituted hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH1.6)(IO3)0.4] in water by dropwise addition of (NH4)2HPO4 and NaIO3 solution to a solution of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O at pH ∼ 11. The reaction proceeded at room temperature under nitrogen gas. Iodate-hydroxyapatite with ∼5–7 mass% iodine has been synthesized by coprecipitation from alkaline aqueous solutions containing IO3−, but iodide did not incorporate into hydroxyapatite [300]. Upon heating iodate-hydroxyapatite, iodine release occurred at temperatures in excess of 500 °C as the IO3− decomposed. In addition, <6% of the incorporated iodine atoms were released after 15 d of leaching [300]. Recent computational calculations and X-ray spectroscopy have shown the highly disordered local structure around the IO3− [301].
Another novel process for incorporating iodine in hydroxyapatite was recently proposed. In this process, Ca4(PO4)2O, Ca3(PO4)2, and NaIO3 were mixed and hydrated in a cementation reaction [163]. This process is similar to the magnesium phosphate bonded ceramic (Ceramicrete) proposed for immobilizing TcO4− and other nuclear wastes [302], [303], [304].
4.7.7. Apatite: lead vanadates (PbV)
In addition to CaP-apatites, considerable attention has been paid to lead vanadate (PbV)-based apatites similar to the common mineral vanadinite, Pb5(VO4)3Cl [181]. Related natural minerals include the phosphate form Pb5(PO4)3Cl (pyromorphite) and the arsenate form Pb5(AsO4)3Cl (mimetite) [305]. In this structure, the Ca2+ is replaced by the larger Pb2+ ion, and the P5+ is replaced by the larger V5+ ion, making available a site for a larger halide ion.
Early research showed that Pb5(VO4)3I could be prepared by a variety of methods. First, Pb3(VO4)2 and PbI2 can be heated at 700 °C for 3 h [266] or PbI2 can be mixed with Pb3(VO4)1.6(PO4)0.4 and heated at 700 °C under pressure of 25 MPa [267]. Hot-pressed Pb5(VO4)3I was also produced, and its leach rate was found to be twice that of AgI embedded in glass [306]. Substitutions of Ag, Ba, and Cd for Pb have been suggested as well [266], [307]. Leaching studies suggest that CO32− was believed to have ion-exchanged for I– in this structure [308]. Results from microwave synthesis methods of Pb5(VO4)3(F,Cl,Br,I) revealed minimal volatilization of halides, even with unsealed containers [309], [310].
Solid solutions of Pb vanadate and phosphate have been proposed to improve sintering behavior [267]. The iodine release rate in pure water at 90 °C was found to be 2.4 × 10−3 g m−2 d−1 for Pb5(VO4)2.4(PO4)0.6I, but the dissolution was incongruent [267]. Consolidation of this material with SPS has been performed with powders and separately with the precursor chemicals orthovanadophosphate and PbI2; slightly denser structures were obtained with by SPS of the precursors than of the pre-reacted material [268], [269]. A composite with an outer shell of sintered Pb3(VO4)1.6(PO4)0.4 and core of Pb5(VO4)2.4(PO4)0.6I has also been prepared [267]. Also, work has been done to look at hot-pressing techniques for consolidating lead vanadate using either SPS [311] or HIP [312].
4.7.8. Bismuth oxides
Layered metal oxide-hydroxide anion scavengers were discovered in the late 1990s and have been developed for immobilizing radioiodine [313]. Krumhansl and Nenoff [313] performed a review and some of that work is summarized here. Bismuth-based sorbent materials are made from units of Bi2O22+with various anions interspersed to maintain a charge balance [313]. The M(OH)+ units can substitute for a (BiO)+ entity but this substitution is difficult to accomplish in the laboratory [314].
Tsuji et al. [315] and Tsuji [316] found that these Bi-containing materials have a strong affinity for SeO32− but not SeO42− or other anions such as SO42−, NO3−, NO2−, Cl−, and Br−. Further experiments showed that if NaOH can be substituted for Na2CO3 and then the mixture was neutralized, it became possible to prepare layered Bi oxide phases that could effectively scavenge trace levels of I−, IO3−, ReO4−, TcO4−, HAsO42−, ClO4−, and SeO32− from aqueous solutions [314], [316]. Tsuji [316] also suggested that these Bi oxide structures could sequester CO32− and Cl− ions.
Preparation of bismuth oxy-iodide materials as waste forms was also examined by Nenoff et al. [287]. These materials were prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3 and KI, mixing them in different ways and then adding NaOH occasionally to cause precipitation. Some intermediate Bi–O–I compositions contained 17–22 mass% of iodine.
More recently, Krumhansl et al. [313] made similar hydrotalcite-like layered Bi–I–O compounds that can capture both I− and IO3− [313]. Hydrotalcite-forming divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Zn2+ used with cationic layers of Sn [317], Zr [318], or Bi [316] have been previously studied. This novel, in situ precipitation process by Krumhansl et al. [313] does not require advanced separation and isolation of I− species from the aqueous solution. In a different study, BPbO2NO3 mixed with I− was shown to convert to BiPbO2I + NO3−, which was then put in low-temperature sintered glass [75].
4.7.9. Iodoboracite
An overlooked mineral for the immobilization of iodine is iodoboracite, ideally M3B7O13I, where M can be a variety of metals including Cu, Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Fe, Cr, and Cd. An example of Cu3B7O13I from Berset et al. [271] is shown in Fig. 10. Depending on the metal ion, the iodine loading in this mineral is 17–26 mass%. A variety of methods exist for producing this mineral, as summarized elsewhere [255], [256], [257], [258], [259]. It is found in trace quantities in nature, but rarely [319]. It has been made hydrothermally in nature [319] and in the laboratory, suggesting that it has good chemical durability.

4.7.10. AgNO3-impregnated alumina (AgA)
The AgA sorbent has been used to capture iodine gases [75]. Consolidation of AgA was conducted using HIP at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C under 175 MPa [75]. The AgI particles were found to be encapsulated within the dense Al2O3 grain boundaries. The final consolidated waste form has a high bulk density (4050 kg m−3) with ∼8% porosity [75], [164]. Dissolution kinetics was measured for the waste form. The mechanism of iodine release was determined to be the corrosion of Al2O3 matrix and exposure of the encapsulated AgI. The release of iodine from the exposed AgI was found to be controlled by its solubility in water. The corrosion rates of Al2O3 in alkaline pH have been well studied and verified for this waste form by Miyakawa et al. [320].
4.7.11. AgNO3-impregnated silica (AgS)
The AgS sorbent was used for DOG treatment in the Karlsruhe reprocessing plant (WAK) for ∼20 y [47], [73], [74]. This product, AC-6120 from Süd Chemie AG [47], is no longer commercially available. The product consisted of ∼1–2 mm diameter granules containing ∼12 mass% Ag. The AC-6120 commercial sorbent was demonstrated to have removal efficiencies of 99.8% and 99.0% for the DOG and VOG streams, respectively [96].
Nishimura and Wada et al. [321], [322], [323] encapsulated the AgI in silica by HIP of the iodine-loaded AgS at 750 °C and 100 MPa. They identified primarily 10–50-μm quartz crystals with thin glassy grain boundaries. Roughly 20-nm AgI crystals were found embedded in the grain boundaries and triple points. The release of iodine from the waste form was determined to be by diffusion of iodine through pores in the grain boundaries of the waste form rather than by dissolution of the silica grains to expose the AgI as initially theorized [323]. The initial iodine release was determined to depend on the square root of time, followed by no release once the solubility of AgI was achieved.
4.7.12. Silicon carbide (SiC)
Silicon carbide (SiC) has been studied as a potential host for radionuclides such as Kr and I because it has several advantageous properties including low diffusivities for gases, high thermal conductivity, high chemical durability, and high stability when subjected to radiation. Ryan et al. [162] used an ion gun to implant I2(g) into SiC during physical vapor deposition with up to ∼9.4 mass% iodine incorporation. Additionally, Audren et al. [324] implanted iodine into SiC at different temperatures and showed that ion implantations at 400 or 600 °C produced significantly less damage than implantation at room temperature with subsequent thermal annealing.
5. Summary and conclusions
This paper updates the current literature summarizing the state-of-the-art capture and immobilization concepts for managing radioiodine. A wide range of sorbents for capture and waste forms for the immobilization of various iodine species [e.g., I2(g), I−, IO3−] were summarized here. The sorbents discussed differ in iodine capacity as well as ease and cost of preparation. The range of materials to address iodine management is wide and will continue to expand in the coming years.
The capture technologies discussed include aqueous scrubbing technologies (i.e., Mercurex, Iodox, and electrolytic scrubbing) and a variety of solid sorbents including Ag0-loaded aluminosilicates (e.g., mordenite, faujasite), AgNO3-impregnated alumina and silica, Ag0-functionalized silica aerogel, chalcogenide aerogels (chalcogels), metal-organic frameworks, TiO2-based sorbents, and carbon-based sorbents (i.e., graphene and granular activated carbon). Information is included as to where capture technologies are deployed in different plants throughout the world. Also, iodine capacities for various sorbents are presented for comparison.
The immobilization technologies discussed include borosilicate, Ag2O–AgI, phosphate, lead, and chalcogenide glasses; glass ceramics; ceramic composites; cements; and inorganic minerals and ceramics including Synroc, iodosodalite, cancrinite, silver zeolite, apatite, bismuth oxides, iodoboracite, AgNO3-impregnated alumina and silica, and SiC. The iodine capacities of the waste form options are presented. Considering that some of these contain the precious metal Ag, it is possible that this Ag could be recovered prior to disposal and recycled but that might not be a cost effective option in some cases.
In conclusion, a wide variety of options are available for both the capture and immobilization of iodine and future off-gas systems will likely be designed with waste management at the forefront to minimize the environmental footprint of the facility. Depending on what the waste stream contains in addition to iodine, and what form of iodine is present within the stream, the capture and immobilization pathways might be different. The aim of this document is to provide a summary of the literature to date and provide some disposal pathway options for a variety of iodine species.
