Abstract
To clear the effects of the hydrodynamic interactions among neighboring vapor bubbles on the saturated pool boiling heat transfer, artificial nucleation sites with several cavity arrangements were manufactured on the substrate surface and measured liquid temperatures near heated substrate by a miniature thermocouple probe with 10 kHz. The surface temperature of heated substrate was measured by an infrared camera with 1 kHz and bubble dynamics were simultaneously visualized by a high-speed video camera with 5 kHz and 10 kHz, respectively. The liquid temperature fluctuations, measured with micro thermocouple 100 μm and 10 μm above the substrate surface, were compared among each other and with the transient temperature fields obtained through IR measurements. Results showed that the hydrodynamic interaction among neighboring bubbles causes the liquid convection, that was only detected 100 µm above the boiling surface. Generally, the degree of liquid temperature fluctuations at 10 μm height and different arrangements of nucleation sites was under 1 K. Here the superheated sublayer in the vicinity of the boiling surface was generally not affected by the convection. Only when the coalescence from two neighboring nucleation sites occurred and the liquid-vapor interface nearly reached the substrate, a steep temperature drop over 2 K was detected. It was concluded that the viscous sublayer stably exists during boiling of water in lower heat flux conditions. To enhance the convective heat transfer in nucleate boiling, coalesced bubble needs to peel off the viscous sublayer during its deformation. Based on the measurements in this study, this peel-off effect only happens when the coalescence point is less than 1 mm above the heated surface.

1. Introduction
The boiling heat transfer is an effective mechanism of heat transfer in high-energy-density devices and the prediction of boiling heat transfer coefficient is very important in many engineering fields [1]. Regimes in boiling heat transfer are categorized as nucleate boiling with the critical heat flux (CHF) as the upper limit, transient boiling, and film boiling. In case of low-heat-flux heating, nucleate boiling heat transfer is observed, whereas transient and film boiling heat transfer take place in case of a higher heat flux condition (usually above 1 MW m−2 for saturated pool boiling of water at normal atmosphere). This work focuses only in nucleate boiling regime, which is considered as one of the most effective and technically controllable approaches for removal of high heat flux mainly due to low temperature differences between the boiling surface and saturation temperature (<50 K) and constant fluid temperature during the phase change. The nucleate boiling heat transfer mechanisms are expressed as microlayer evaporation and contact line heat transfer, transient conduction during rewetting process (i.e. quenching) and micro-convection [2]. The microlayer evaporation, contact line heat transfer and transient conduction during rewetting process have been extensively analyzed based on both the solid temperature measurement [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and the liquid microlayer thickness measurement [8], [9], [10]. Although the convective heat transfer in nucleate boiling has been considered to be enhanced by hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring boiling bubbles, it is yet not fully understood.
Recently, the flow induced by a single boiling bubble dynamics was visualized by the particle tracking method [11]. Interestingly, it was found that only flow parallel to the heated substrate surface was present, but not perpendicular to the substrate surface. This suggests there was no vertical mixing of the fluid despite an expected vortex motion caused by bubble departure. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the convective effect of the single boiling bubble nucleation/departure on boiling heat transfer will be very small. However, the convective heat transfer can be expected to be enhanced by the hydrodynamic interaction among neighboring multiple boiling bubbles. So far, the experiments of the boiling bubble interaction were conducted by means of localized laser heating [12], artificial cavities [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] and micro-array heaters [18]. In these studies, the boiling bubble interactions were mainly evaluated by the bubble motion, coalescence, frequency, surface temperature and local heat flux. As for the liquid temperature measurements, there were optical methods and micro thermocouple (TC) probing methods used so far. Optical methods like interferometry and shadowgraphy [19], [20] are non-invasive and often allow measurement of the entire field around a growing bubble. Moreover, the developing fluorescence-based thermometry will likely allow submicron temperature mapping around a growing vapor bubble, similar to that recently demonstrated on substrate surfaces [21]. As for the probing methods, a bare wire TC is usually used to measure liquid/vapor temperature in a single point with high spatiotemporal resolution [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Until now, the time-averaged temperature distributions proved the existence of the high temperature-gradient region near the substrate surface, so-called “superheated sublayer” [22], [23], [24]. In all those studies, the data was statistically analyzed, but the positional relationship between the TC probe and bubble was not controlled. In our recent study [26], the single nucleation site boiling experiments were conducted, the time-evolutions of temperature at several positions near the substrate surface were measured, and the TC probe position and bubble dynamics were grasped simultaneously by high-speed visualization.
High speed camera is the most frequently used tool to observe bubble dynamics in nucleate boiling process either directly through the fluid, in shadowgraphy configuration or even through the transparent heater substrate. Sinha et al. [27] observed bubble lift-off and re-attachment and local thermal field by the rainbow schlieren deflectometry method on vertical wall and subcooled flow boiling condition. Zhou et al. [28] visualized departing velocity of horizontally coalesced from smooth and micro-pin-finned surfaces. The velocity was calculated by considering energy balance and net force of merged bubble. Sarker et al. [29] focused on the relation between surface conditions and bubble waiting period and recorded bubble behavior on a vertical heater. They found that high wettability and rough surfaces resulted a shorter bubble waiting period. Narayan et al. [30] focused on bubble departure characteristics of the single vapor bubble on upward substrate and pool subcooled condition. The bubble situations segmented into stable vapor bubble, oscillatory vapor bubbles and oscillating-departing vapor bubbles. Michaei et al. [31] conducted visualization of isolated bubble behavior by high speed camera under several sub-atmospheric conditions. The changes of bubble size, frequency and shape was observed as the function of the decreased pressure. Surtaev et al. [32] observed the evolution of dry spots under bubbles by high speed camera through transparent heating surface from the bottom side. They found that pressure reduction effected on the growth rate of dry spots.
In order to modify some key bubble characteristics (i.e. nucleation frequency, growth time and waiting time, departure diameter, activation temperature) to enhance local and global heat transfer coefficient, several authors developed and tested different surface modification techniques. Cheng et al. [33] created biphilic surfaces with hydrophobic patterns on hydrophilic copper tube. Increase in contact angle of hydrophobic spots decreased the waiting time and prolonged bubble growth time due to locally persistent vapor phase. The best performance was achieved on biphilic surfaces with the hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic contact angle ratio of 10°/120°. Zhao et al. [34] investigated boiling performance on square micropillar array copper surfaces in water pool boiling tests. It was shown that heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing micropillar height at low heat flux regime, but above 500 kW m−2 the lower pillars performed better as they allowed easier replenishment of active nucleation sites. Elkholy et al. [35] recently fabricated low-cost porous polymer fixtures by 3D printer in order to control location of active nucleation sites, influence bubble dynamics and enhance overall boiling performance of water. It was found that small unite cell size of 3D printed structures increased heat transfer coefficient by 80%, but not the CHF, while the larger unit cell sizes were beneficial only for CHF enhancement. In addition to total number and distribution of active nucleation sites, the global boiling performance is also directly connected with single bubble dynamics and bubble coalescence. Therefore, development of enhanced surfaces for optimized boiling performance also requires knowledge about predominant heat removal mechanisms during single bubble growth and bubble coalescence event.
To partially fill the knowledge gap, series of saturated pool boiling experiments were conducted on surfaces with predefined locations of active nucleation sites in order to reveal under which circumstances the bubble coalescence can enhance convective heat transfer. To reach this goal, several surfaces were functionalized via ion etching or direct laser texturing to design different arrangement of active nucleation sites. Moreover, high-frequency (e.g. 10 kHz) liquid temperature measurements by a miniature TC probe were combined with the substrate surface temperature measurements by the infrared (IR) camera running at 1 kHz and the synchronous bubble dynamics visualization by means of HSV camera at 5 and 10 kHz. The degree of temperature fluctuations at 100 μm height (in the superheated layer) from the substrate surface were compared to those at 10 μm height (in the superheated sublayer) and the time-evolutions of liquid superheat were also compared to those at the boiling surface.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental apparatus
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of experimental apparatus. The purified distilled water was filled in a rectangular transparent container made of polycarbonate with the volume of 30 × 30 × 150 mm3 (#12 in Fig. 1). The experiments were conducted in an open system to guarantee a constant saturation temperature with an atmospheric pressure and to easily control the TC-probe traverse system. An immersion heater (#6) kept the bulk liquid at saturation temperature. During data acquisition, the immersion heater was switched off to prevent the natural convection induced by the immersion heater from disturbing the test section. The bulk temperature was monitored with the sheathed TC of type K (#11) with a standard error of ± 0.3 K, and the subcooling degree was kept under 1 K. The local liquid superheat was measured with the custom-made miniature K-type TC probe (#7), which was inserted from the top of the container and traversed in both horizontal and vertical directions: the TC probe was moved by a micrometer positioning table in horizontal direction manually, while vertical position was set through a stepping motor and linear guide rail. The vapor bubble behavior was visualized by the HSV MEMRECAM camera (#5) simultaneously with temperature measurements by the TC probe. HSV camera was also used to confirm the position of the TC probe.

The illumination was guided through the fiber light guide (#10) and was positioned at the opposite side to the HSV camera. The temperature measurement and the bubble visualization were synchronized by a TTL trigger signal (#3). The heat flux was supplied to the test section by a heater unit (#9) installed on the bottom of the container. Four cartridge heaters were inserted in a copper (Cu) block from the bottom of the closed polycarbonate cylinder. Three K-type ϕ1.0 mm sheathed TCs with the accuracy of ±0.3 K were installed in the centerline of Cu block with 5 mm intervals to calculate the average heat flux. The heat flux was calculated by the Fourier’s law, q = −k(dT/dz), where q is the heat flux, k is thermal conductivity of Cu and dT/dz is temperature gradient in vertical direction determined as a linear approximation based on three measured temperature points at the centerline of Cu block. On the top end of Cu block, a micro-fabricated Silicon (Si) tip (#8) was used as a heating substrate placed onto the block with COPASLIP’s thermal conductive grease to reduce the contact thermal resistance.
2.2. TC probe
Fig. 2 shows details of the custom-made miniature TC probe: (a) entire probe, (b) image of Alumel/Chromel junction and (c) Photo of ϕ 25 μm TC probe tip. The TC probe was composed of a stainless-steel tube and an injection needle in which the wires were put in. Only few millimeters of wire from the tip of TC probe pointed out of the injection needle to minimize the vibrations of the tip. The tip of the TC probe was made of ϕ 25 μm bare Alumel/Chromel, whereas the remaining part was made of ϕ 125 μm insulated wires. The Alumel and Chromel bare wires were welded to make a junction at the TC probe tip as a sensing point. After welding, the TC probe tip was mechanically polished to reduce the size from over 50 μm down to 20 μm. The sensing point was defined as the position at the height (z) of 10 μm when the probe touched the Si-tip. Fig. 2(d) shows one example of the measurements of liquid superheat when the TC probe penetrated the growing vapor bubble. Based on the measurement it can be seen that TC probe reaches the 63.2% of the total temperature change in about 0.2 ms. Based on that it can be estimated that the time constant of the TC probe (accounting entire measurement chain) is less than 0.2 ms.

As a cold junction, the mixture of crushed ice and water was used to maintain constant temperature of 0 °C. The electromotive force (voltage) induced by the temperature difference between the TC probe tip and the cold junction was measured with data acquisition Yokogawa WE7000 (16-bit A/D converter) and Monodaq-E-STG (24-bit A/D converter, used in experiment with IR camera, see Section 2.4). The measured temperature essentially included the power supply noise (50–60 Hz), which was effectively filtered out during the post processing. Both of our data acquisition systems were able to measure the voltage within a ± 100 mV range with a root-mean-square (RMS) noise of less than 5 µV. Considering the sensitivity of the TC probe (S = 40 µV K−1), the theoretical measurement uncertainty of the temperature difference is a ratio between RMS and sensitivity and equals 0.13 K. For a 95% confidence level with a coverage factor of 2 [36], the expanded measurement uncertainty of the temperature difference equals 0.25 K. It should be noted that the RMS value was experimentally evaluated to be 0.09 K, which is even less then theoretically predicted.
2.3. Heater design
Si-tip with the area of 30 × 30 mm2 and thickness of 625 μm (Fig. 3) was treated by ion etching in order to produce cavities as an artificial nucleation site. Circular-shaped cavity arrangements were fabricated at the center of Si-tip. On the back side, a circular ditch was made to avoid heat losses in the horizontal direction and to maintain accurate positioning between Cu block and Si-tip. The inner diameter of the ditch was 10 mm (the same as top end diameter of the Cu block), the width was 100 μm and the depth was 500 μm.

The cavity arrangements and the horizontal measurement positions of the TC probe are shown in Fig. 4. Several cavity arrangements were prepared: (a) single cavity, (b) 2 cavities at 5 mm pitch, (c) 2 cavities at 2 mm pitch and (d) 3 cavities with triangular arrangement at 3 mm pitch. For multiple cavity arrangements in Fig. 4(b–d), the cavities were 80 μm deep and 10 μm in diameter, whereas a single cavity in Fig. 4(a) was 15 μm in diameter. The TC probe tip was positioned at two places: in case (a) just above the cavity and 1.5 mm away from the cavity center, in cases (b), (c) and (d) the probe was positioned at the mid-point of the cavities.

Fig. 4. Cavity arrangements and TC probe positions.
The bare wire part of the TC probe was located carefully not to be in the bubble’s pathway. In the vertical direction, the measuring positions were z = 10–100 μm with 10 μm step and z = 100–1000 μm with 100 μm step. At the positions of z = 10 μm (in the superheated sublayer) and 100 μm (in the superheated layer), the temperature was measured by the TC probe and the bubble dynamics was simultaneously visualized by the HSV camera. The heat flux was maintained in the low-heat-flux region (23.8–70 kW m−2), just enough to activate the cavities, so the unintended bubble nucleations were not generated elsewhere. The sampling rate of the temperature measurement by the TC probe was 10 kHz and the HSV camera was set to 10 kHz.

TC probe measurement is able to obtain the liquid/vapor temperature at a specified position above the boiling surface, but it has a chance to overlook the important phenomenon occurring on the surface itself. On the other hand, the IR camera can acquire the temperature field of the substrate surface, but it is difficult to grasp the liquid and bubble behavior above it. To analyze the relationship between the liquid temperature, the temperature field at the substrate surface and the bubble dynamics, the measurements were conducted simultaneously with three methods, namely the IR camera, the miniature TC probe and the HSV camera. The test section, image processing methods and local heat flux calculations for the IR measurements were the same as in the references [37], [38], with addition of the miniature TC probe (#3) and its manual positioning system with translation stages (#5) in x-y-z directions. The bubble dynamics and the TC probe position were visualized by the HSV camera (#7), and its sampling rate was 10 kHz. Three devices were synchronized by a TTL signal and TC voltage measurements were acquired by Monodaq-E-STG amplifier.
In this experiment, the boiling chamber with the volume of 170 × 100 × 100 mm3 (#1) was made of the double glass walls, and the working fluid was degassed double distilled water (Roth 3478). The bulk water temperature in the container was kept at saturation temperature by an auxiliary heater, which was turned off during the time of data acquisition. The bulk liquid temperature was measured by the sheathed K-type TC (#4). The boiling occurred at the surface of a joule-heated stainless-steel foil (AISI 316, 25 μm thick; hereafter, a substrate foil) (#2). The direct current was supplied to the substrate foil, whereas the voltage drop, and the current were used to calculate the dissipated heat flux. The bottom surface of the substrate foil was painted with a custom-made paint (ε = 0.9) to enable IR measurements (#9), whereas the electromagnetic radiation from the bottom of the foil was reflected through a golden mirror (#10). The frame rate of the IR camera was 1 kHz and the pixel-to-pixel resolution was 125 μm. The extended absolute measurement uncertainty of the IR camera is 2 K and the noise equivalent differential temperature is 20 mK. Relative uncertainty of the measured heat flux was 0.5%. Detailed analysis of measurement uncertainty and calculation of local heat flux is provided in the Supplementary Material of the ref. [39].
To accurately determine locations of active nucleation sites (as with the ion etched Si-tips), the substrate foil was textured by a fiber laser (SPI Lasers, Ltd., G4, SP-020P-A-HS-S-A-Y) with the same parameters previously explained in [40]. Three laser textured patches with the surface area of 0.3 × 0.3 mm2 were aligned in line and separated 3.5 mm apart. As previously observed in other studies [38], [39], [40], each laser textured region contains wide range of vapor-trapping microcavities with diameters in the range of ~0.2–10 μm. These cavities serve as active nucleation sites for different kinds of fluids, including water, ethanol, ethanol/water mixtures and even FC-72. In this study the measurements were performed under a constant heat flux of 50 kW m−2 at which bubble nucleation occurred on all three laser textured areas and no other parasitic boiling occurred in the surrounding surface. The TC probe tip was positioned at the center between two cavities 100 μm above the substrate foil.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Characteristics of temperature fluctuations
The degree of temperature fluctuation can be considered as one of the indicators for capturing liquid convection. It should be noted that the test section was not ideally thermally insulated from the environment, so the thermal boundary condition of the container wall was not adiabatic. Fig. 6 shows the time evolution of liquid superheat and temperature fluctuation for the single cavity on Si-tip in the case where the TC probe was positioned 100 μm above the center of the cavity. Fig. 6(a) shows that on a large time scale of several seconds, the maximum liquid superheat fluctuates from about 5.6 K down to 2.8 K with a frequency of ~1–2 Hz, which can be attributed to the movement of water level (10 cm above the boiling surface) and natural convection inside the container.

Fig. 6(b, c) represent time evolutions of liquid superheat for 1 s and 100 ms periods, respectively. In Fig. 6(b) the effect of water level movement and natural convection cells were still detected, whereas in Fig. 6(c) three bubble life cycles are clearly observed. Thus, 100 ms was chosen as the measurement period to focus on bubble dynamics. Sampled data during the 10 s of recording was divided into 100 periods of 100 ms and the fluctuations were averaged for all 100 periods. The degree of average temperature fluctuations well represents the liquid convection induced by the boiling bubble dynamics as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Variation of degree of average temperature fluctuations varied with distance from substrate surface in z direction for several cavity arrangements.
Fig. 7 shows typical examples of the variation of the degree of average temperature fluctuations varied with the distance from the surface in z direction (normal direction to the substrate surface) for various cases: single cavity, 2 cavities at 2 mm pitch, 2 cavities at 5 mm pitch and 3 cavities at 3 mm pitch. For the single cavity experiments the heat flux was 23.8 kW m−2 whereas for all other cases the average heat flux was set to 31.7 kW m−2. The TC probe was positioned according to the Fig. 4. The fluctuation of temperature values at z = 10 μm in the cases of “single cavity”, “2 cavities @ 5 mm” and “3 cavities” were less than 1 °C. As the measurement position (z) is increased, all the measured temperature fluctuations are higher. The weakest fluctuations were observed for “2 cavities @ 5 mm” (almost the same as with single cavity experiment), whereas the largest fluctuations were observed for “2 cavities @ 2 mm”. This indicates there exists a minimal distance between the nucleation sites at which a hydrodynamic interaction between the bubbles is very small, or the same situation as the individual bubble nucleation. The results for “2 cavities @ 5 mm” show there was almost no hydrodynamic interaction between bubbles at 5 mm pitch. In the case of “2 cavities @ 2 mm” and “3 cavities” it could be understood that the convection induced by the bubble dynamics was stronger, and the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple bubbles enhanced the convection. As the position of the TC probe approached the substrate surface, the convection became weaker for these four tested cases. For the “2 cavities @ 2 mm” case the degree of average temperature fluctuations was the highest throughout entire measured range.
Fig. 8 shows the degree of average temperature fluctuations and its standard deviations at z = 10 μm position on several cavity-arrangements with increase of the heat flux. It should be noted that boiling from the single cavity arrangement was only performed up to about 25 kW m−2. After that heat flux, a parasitic boiling occurred in the vicinity of the artificial nucleation site and the results could not be directly compared with those of a single isolated bubble. For most of the cavity arrangements, the fluctuations became higher with increasing heat flux, but they were still too small to contribute to heat transfer enhancement (i.e. one order of magnitude smaller compared to the temperature fluctuations observed during microlayer evaporation). Only for “2 cavities @ 2 mm” arrangement, the fluctuations increased significantly with increase of the heat flux. This may be an evidence of enhanced convective heat transfer in between two active nucleation sites. To partially answer this, next section includes comparison of time evolution of liquid superheat and visualization of bubble dynamics.

3.2. Time evolution of liquid superheat and visualization of bubble dynamics
In this section the relationships between the liquid superheat and the simultaneous visualization of the bubble behavior were investigated for several cavity arrangements. Fig. 9 shows the relationship between the typical time evolution of liquid superheat and the bubble dynamics in one bubble life cycle. The arrangement was “single cavity”, the TC probe was positioned 100 μm above the center of the cavity and the heat flux was 23.8 kW m−2. Time evolution of liquid superheat shows two complete bubble life cycles with a period of around 35 ms and the dashed lines indicate the beginning of each nucleation (i.e. the time of TC probe penetrated through the bubble). As the TC probe tip entered the bubble, the measured temperature decreased rapidly from liquid superheat to the saturation temperature inside the bubble. In the bubble growing process, the bubbles slightly moved away from the TC probe (e.g. see Fig. 9 at 15 ms timestamp), but this is unfortunately inevitable for an intrusive measurement like TC probe. After bubble departure, the temperature of thermal boundary layer was increasing for about 25 ms mainly due to heat conduction until reaching the superheated value prior to the next nucleation event. It was previously confirmed by the particle tracking visualization [11] that no vortex occurs in the superheated layer at such low heat flux values in single bubble experiment.

Fig. 10(a) shows typical time-evolution of liquid superheat and visualization of bubble dynamics for single nucleation cavity arrangement, at which the TC probe was positioned 1.5 mm away from the cavity and 10 μm above the substrate surface. Heat flux was set to 23.8 kW m−2. Dashed lines indicate the beginning of nucleation. Within 300 ms, the bubble was generated 4 times, but there were no observed temperature fluctuations that would correspond to the bubble dynamics. The flow induced by the bubble motion in terms of pushing and retracting liquid parallel to the substrate surface [11], [26] should have passed the TC probe tip, but the temperature did not vary.

Fig. 10(b) shows typical time-evolution of liquid superheat and bubble dynamics for the same condition as Fig. 10(a), but for the TC probe positioned 100 μm above the surface. Dashed lines indicate the beginning of nucleation events. At this height, temperature fluctuation corresponding to each bubble nucleation was detected, but its peak-to-peak amplitude did not exceed 1 K. Based on the results presented in Fig. 10(a, b) it can be concluded that the bubble-growth induced flow 1.5 mm away from the nucleation site and close to the boiling surface (i.e. 10 μm in z direction) is ether negligible or has a direction/velocity mainly parallel to the substrate surface, which demonstrates there is no mixing in the direction normal to the substrate surface. However, 100 μm above the substrate surface, liquid superheat increase under 0.4 K was observed 15 ms after the bubble nucleation as the superheated liquid from thermal boundary layer is pushed towards the TC probe. After that, a decrease of liquid superheat is observed, as the entrained liquid from the upper region comes to the place [11]. At the position 1.5 mm away from the isolated nucleation site (in x direction) and 100 μm above the substrate (in z direction) the liquid is slightly mixed in both horizontal and vertical direction.
Fig. 11(a) shows typical time-evolution of liquid superheat and bubble dynamics for 3 cavities arranged in a triangular lattice with 3 mm pitch, whereas the TC probe height was set to 10 μm and the heat flux was 31.7 kW m−2. Dashed lines indicate the beginning of nucleation from each of three active nucleation sites. Interestingly, the degree of temperature change inside the superheated boundary layer in the vicinity of boiling surface was very small – virtually inside the peak-to-peak measurement noise, similar as was observed for a single bubble measurements in Fig. 10(a). Only in the case of three near-simultaneous nucleations at 162 ms timestamp (three dashed lines are closely appeared), the liquid temperature drop of about 0.7 K is observed. Results imply that the convection caused by the hydrodynamic interaction among neighboring bubbles could not peel off the liquid in the superheated sublayer (at 10 μm height).

Fig. 11. Typical time-evolution of liquid superheat (a) 10 μm and (b) 100 μm above the substrate surface in the center of a triangular lattice with three active nucleation sites with simultaneous visualization of bubble growth at 31.7 kW m−2.
When the TC probe was positioned 100 μm above the substrate surface (Fig. 11(b)), the liquid temperature fluctuations with peak-to-peak amplitude of over 1 K were observed. Despite more complex bubble dynamics compared to the single cavity experiment (Fig. 10), similar behavior can be observed in time evolution of liquid superheat. Each nucleation event causes ~0.4 K increase in liquid superheat 15 ms after the bubble nucleation followed by a temperature drop so that the liquid superheat approximately reaches its starting value. In the case of two near-simultaneous nucleations (see Fig. 11 at 165 ms timestamp), the liquid superheat 100 μm above the surface is increased for around 1 K, which is twice the value otherwise observed for single nucleation event. Taking into account that the maximum liquid superheat is observed 20 ms after nucleation (which is significantly longer than time it takes for a moving front to travel across 1.5 mm distance [11]), our results show that the conduction inside the liquid strongly affects the temperature distribution around the vapor bubble, despite the existing hydrodynamic and convective flows. In any case, bubble interaction between neighboring nucleation sites enhances heat transfer in the liquid 100 μm above the boiling surface.
Fig. 12 shows typical time evolution of liquid superheat and bubble dynamics measured 10 μm above the substrate surface in the middle of 2 nucleation cavities separated 2 mm apart. In this configuration arrangement, 2 bubbles touched, coalesced, and formed one larger bubble. The degree of temperature fluctuation 10 μm above the substrate surface was clearly larger compared to the non-coalescing bubbles discussed previously. In this case, two regions (shown as grey-colored regions in Fig. 12) were compared. In Region 1, no significant temperature fluctuations were observed. Two bubble coalesced far above the TC probe, so interface movement from individual bubbles or calescence event did not affect the temperature in the liquid microlayer. In Region 2, however, the liquid superheat dropped for about 3 K approximately 10 ms after the beginning of coalescence. In this case the bubble interface passed close to the TC probe tip as shown in the photos at 194 ms and 196 ms, respectively. This means the convection caused by the bubble coalescence affects the temperature field in the superheated sublayer, only if the horizontal coalescence takes place close to the boiling surface – less than 1 mm above the substrate surface based on our measured results.

Fig. 13. Typical time evolution of liquid superheat measured by TC probe 100 μm above the substrate surface: (a) time evolution of liquid superheat and wall superheat measured by IR camera, (b) time evolution of local heat flux at the substrate surface exactly below the TC probe position and (c) comparison between bubble dynamics (photos), substrate-surface temperature distributions (IR) and calculated heat flux distribution. The sample had 3 laser textured nucleation sites aligned in line at 3.5 mm pitch whereas TC probe position was at the center between 2 cavities and its position is marked with symbol (+).
Fig. 13(a) shows time evolution of liquid superheat measured by the TC probe and wall superheat by the IR measurement, and their variations do not coincide with each other after the bubble nucleations. Two bubbles generated from neighboring cavities (the TC probe was positioned in the middle) independently grew and then started to coalesce (see Fig. 13(c) at 220 ms timestamp). Similar situation was previously discussed and observed in Fig. 12. Initially, just before 210 ms timestamp, first bubble started to grow and radially pushed the superheated liquid away so that TC probe detected slight temperature increase until the first bubble interface approached the TC and temperature started to fall at 211–212 ms as shown in Fig. 13(a). At 212 ms, the second bubble (on right hand side of Fig. 13(c)) started to grow and radially pushed the liquid as well as the first bubble away from the TC probe for which the liquid temperature increased about 10 K at 212–214 ms time frame as shown in Fig. 13(a). After that, the second bubble approached the TC probe and measured temperature decreased to the saturation temperature indicating that the TC probe temporarily penetrated into the second bubble. At 220 ms both bubbles interfaces left the TC probe position. Both bubbles start to coalesce at 220 ms and after that the liquid temperature gradually decreases from 112 °C (at 222 ms) down to 102.5 °C (at 227 ms) indicating that the coalescence event enhanced the downflow of a fresh liquid. Note that the coalescence point is about 2 mm above the heated substrate surface. IR measurements on Fig. 13(c) clearly show both nucleation events as the microlayer evaporation causes rapid temperature drop at the bubble footprints [the unit of wall temperature is °C in Fig. 13(c)]. What is important, the enhanced convection at 100 μm height due to the bubble coalescence (measured by the TC probe) is not affecting the boiling surface temperature and does not enhance heat transfer from the substrate surface. This is also confirmed by the local heat flux calculated from the IR temperature data (see Fig. 13(b) at 220–235 time-frame).
4. Conclusion
Within this study several heaters with well-defined nucleation sites were developed in order to investigate the interactions among neighboring vapor bubbles on the convective heat transfer in saturated pool boiling of water. Results are supported by synchronized high-speed micro TC measurements (to measure liquid superheat), video recordings (to determine bubble size and dynamics) and partially also IR thermography (to measure transient temperature fields of the boiling surface). Most important conclusions are highlighted below:
The liquid convection induced by the bubble dynamics at 100 μm height in the superheated layer from the substrate surface was enhanced by the hydrodynamic interaction among neighboring bubbles.
The liquid temperature in the superheated sublayer at 10 μm height from the substrate surface and the substrate surface temperature was generally not affected by the liquid convection. It was concluded that the convection could not peel off the viscous liquid sublayer on the substrate. Thus, the convection in the superheated layer induced by the single bubble dynamics cannot enhance the boiling heat transfer.
Only when the neighboring bubbles coalesced very close to the boiling surface (i.e. when the coalescence started ~1 mm above the substrate surface), liquid temperature drop was observed at the 10 μm height. This indicates that the convection caused by the bubble coalescence affects the temperature field in the superheated sublayer only if the horizontal coalescence takes place close to the boiling surface. It can be assumed that even for the higher heat fluxes only these near-wall events can cause enhanced heat transfer coefficient and also affect the CHF, which should be proved with further experimental work.
