ABSTRACT
In the event of a radiation emergency, it is necessary to assess intake and radiation dose for the internally contaminated casualties. This paper provides relatively rapid and simple procedures of bioassay. Faeces samples were ashed to improve sample homogeneity. Gamma spectrometry was used for radioactivity measurement. The measured results, including activity of the biosam- ples and associated uncertainty, were evaluated for traceability based on ANSI N42.22 and bias and precision based on ANIS/HPS N13.30. For all urine customary exercise samples, measurement results of 60Co and 137Cs were in good agreement with NIST values within 5% and satisfied ANSI N42.22 and ANIS/HPS N13.30 acceptance criteria. In contrast, the uncertainty of 57Co was quite large and the activity differed from the NIST value by 18%. For the urine emergency preparedness exercise, all measured results agreed well with NIST values, with less than 10% difference. Syn- thetic faeces samples included 54Mn, 60Co, and 134Cs. The activity of 60Co was different from the NIST value by 9%, whereas the results for 54Mn and 134Cs were within 3.2%. The measurement pro- cedures given in this study can be applied to assess intake of radionuclides and resulting radiation dose to casualties.KEYWORDS

1.Introduction
In the event of a radiation emergency, it is required to assess radionuclide intake and internal radiation dose for the internally contaminated casualties. The inter- nal radiation dose depends on type and amount of  intake radionuclide and intake route (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, absorption, or wound absorption). There- fore, appropriate measurement methods and biosam- ples for the assessment should be selected by consid- ering intake route, biokinetics, and excretion route of radionuclide and sample availability [1–6].
Direct or indirect measurement methods are avail- able for the radionuclides in the human body: in vivo bioassays are commonly used to measure radioactive materials in the human body directly via whole-body or organ counting. In vitro bioassay analysis is an example of an indirect method that is used to measure radioactive materials in the human body via excreta (e.g. urine and faeces), blood, or sweat [1–3,7]. For  the radionuclides emitting low energy gamma rays,   in vitro bioassay measurements are especially sensi- tive. However, high uncertainty is associated with this approach [2]. Generally, gamma spectroscopy is used for the measurement of gamma-emitting radionuclides in urine and faeces samples.
The credibility of radioactivity measurements is important for radiation emergency preparedness. Such quality assurance can be obtained by participating in
external performance evaluation program. The trace- ability evaluation is a key element in assuring mea- surement capability. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established radiochemistry inter- comparison program (NRIP) for environmental and bioassay radioactivity measurements [8].
The National Radiation Emergency Medical Cen- ter (NREMC) in Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences (KIRAMS) was constituted to pre- pare a countermeasure of medical preparedness and response involved in nuclear and radiological disaster. The NREMC performs intake and dose assessments for internally contaminated casualties. We took part in NRIP for bioassay performance evaluation from 2012 to 2014. NRIP biosamples, synthetic urine, and/or fae- ces samples spiked with radionuclides were supplied to NREMC. We measured radionuclide concentrations of the biosamples and reported the measurement values. NIST evaluated credibility of these measurements.
This paper summarises experience of NRIP par- ticipation. We established relatively rapid and  sim- ple procedures of bioassay radioactivity measurements, including pretreatment of biosamples, measurement of samples, and result evaluation. The established pro- cedures can be applied to assess intake of radionu-  clides and resulting radiation dose to casualties. Such capabilities should be available for radiation emergency response.

2.Materials and methods
2.1.NIST radiochemistry intercomparison program (NRIP)
The objectives of the NRIP program were to assess  measurement traceability for radiochemical analysis, evaluate capability of radiochemical methods, and val- idate new radiochemical methods to improve quality of low level measurements [8]. NIST evaluated trace- ability based on American National Standards Institute (ANSI) N42.22 standard and bias and precision based on American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS)  N13.30  standard  [9-10].
The synthetic urine intercomparison program had two options: customary exercise (CE) and emergency preparedness exercise (EPE). CE and EPE results have to be reported within 60 days and 8 hours after receipt of the samples, respectively. For this study, all the measure- ment results were reported within the deadlines. For synthetic urine samples, CE evaluation was performed from 2012 to 2014 and EPE was performed from 2013 to 2014. Synthetic faeces sample evaluation took place in 2013 using only the CE option.
Relative expanded uncertainty with a confidence interval of 95% and k of 2 was included in the analy- sis results. These results were then provided to NRIP for evaluation of traceability and relative bias and pre- cisions with respect to ANSI and HPS standards.
2.2.Pretreatment of synthetic biosamples and radioactivity measurement
Table 1 lists the composition and mass ratio of the  synthetic urine and faeces samples. The synthetic urine sample medium consisted mostly of water (over
90%), Na2SO4, KCl, and urea (carbamide) spiked with radionuclides. The faeces sample medium consisted mostly of water (over 64%), leucine, lysine, gelatine, cel- lulose, peanut oil, and ashless filter paper (diameter  37 mm), with radionuclide additives.
It is necessary to make sample homogenised for radioactivity measurement. Faeces samples require pre- treatment before measurement due to heterogeneous characteristics of the sample medium. The pretreat- ment methods of faeces samples include partition- ing/dissolution, freezing/mixing, and ashing [2,11–12]. The partitioning/dissolution pretreatment can guaran- tee sample homogeneity. However, the technique is usually combined with alpha spectrometry or beta-ray analysis and thus need complicated, labour-intensive, and time consuming pretreatment process. The freez- ing/mixing pretreatment is a simple procedure for sam- ple pretreatment. However, it cannot guarantee sam- ple homogeneity. On the other hand, ashing pretreat- ment is relatively rapid and simple. In addition, the pre- treatment can improve sample homogeneity suitable for gamma-ray spectroscopy.
In this study, synthetic urine samples were mea- sured without pretreatment. Synthetic urine CE analysis included five samples with randomly spiked radionu- clides and three blank samples without radionuclides. Each sample was placed into a 90-mL U8 bottle and then measured with high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector for 80,000 sec. The number of urine EPE test- ing samples was the same with the number of CE sam- ples. Due to short reporting time, EPE testing urine was placed in a 1-L Marinelli beaker for measurement. However, because the supplied sample was slightly less than 1 L, purified water was added to the EPE samples for same measurement geometry with calibration. The EPE samples were measured for 5000 sec with HPGe detector.
Figure 1. NIST synthetic faeces sample: original sample (left), after drying (center), and after ashing (right).
The synthetic faeces sample was not in the liquid phase. Therefore, a pretreatment procedure was used to improve sample homogeneity for radiation measure- ments. Figure 1 describes the phase change of the faeces sample undergoing ash pretreatment. The faeces sam- ples were first dried in a fume hood for 6 hours at   100 °C and then ashed for organic component elim- ination. Synthetic faeces samples were  ashed  using an electric furnace for 10 hours at 550 °C [13]. For radiation emergency preparedness, rapid procedure of bioassay may be necessary to handle large volume of samples. From that aspect, it will be better to ash a sam- ple at relatively high temperature. However, the ash- ing temperature should be carefully selected because radioactive cesiums may be lost by volatilisation from a sample ashed at high temperature. The boiling point of the caesium is 670 °C. In this study, it was diffi-  cult to completely eliminate organic components in a sample under 550 °C. It was estimated to take more than 24 hours of ashing time if the ashing temperature of 450 °C was applied. In addition, the measurement results of 134Cs and 137Cs in this study were in good agreements with NIST values with difference less than only 3.2%. After ashing, the samples were evaluated for mineralisation, as indicated by the residual colour. If the residual colour was light grey, then the sample was mineralised as shown in Figure 1 [2]. However, if the ash temperature is low or if the ashing time is insuffi- cient, then a residue consisting of mostly organic com- ponents tends to form. In this case, the colour of the residue is black instead of light grey. Moreover, the black
ash is difficult to dissolve in acid. Thus, the ash proce- dure may need to be repeated to achieve the appropri- ate homogenisation. Therefore, the ash temperature and combustion time should be carefully monitored during radionuclide analysis. Using the ash method, approxi- mately one day was required for pretreatment of syn- thetic faeces samples.
Table 2 shows the weight change in the faeces sam- ple following pretreatment. The average mass of ashed samples was 2.30 0.30 g (1.71–2.71 g), or about 2.5% of the original mass in 2013. For the 2014 CE testing faeces, the average mass of ashed samples was 2.30
0.02 g (2.24–2.33 g), or about 2.8% of the original mass. Approximately 64% of the water content had evap- orated, and about 30% of the other organic compo- nents were eliminated by the ashing process. After the ash procedure, the samples were dissolved in 100 mL of 6 mol HCl for radioactivity measurements. The radionuclides retained their homogeneity in the acidic medium. The average mass of the dissolved samples in the 90-mL U8 bottles was 101.46	0.18 g (101.29– 101.82 g) in 2013 and 101.57	0.62 g (101.03–101.95 g) in 2014. The average solution density was 1.13 g mL−1. Samples were measured with a p-type HPGe detector (Model GC3018, Canberra, CT, U.S.A), having a relative efficiency of 30% and a full width at half maximum  of
1.8 keV for 1.3 MeV gamma rays. The HPGe detector operation and radioactivity analysis were controlled by GENIE-2000 software (Canberra, CT, U.S.A). Energy and efficiency calibration procedures were performed using a mixed-nuclide gamma-ray-certified  reference

material, with radionuclides 241Am, 109Cd, 139Ce, 57Co, 113Sn, 137Cs, 60Co, and 88Y spiked in an agar matrix. The gamma-ray energy ranged from 59.5 to 1836.1 keV.
2.3.Result evaluation
The traceability of the measurement results was evalu- ated by comparing our results with NIST values. The basic information included massic activity and rela-tive expanded uncertainty for traceability and accuracy evaluation. The activity concentration was given by thefollowing expression [14]:
@1
where A is the activity concentration (Bq g−1), ε is the efficiency at the photopeak energy, m is sample mass (g), Iγ is the emission probability of the gamma line corresponding to the peak energy, ts is the live time of the sample spectrum collection (sec), K1 is the correc- tion factor for the nuclide decay from the time the sam- ple was collected to the start of the measurement, K2 is the correction factor for the nuclide decay during thecounting period, K3
is the correction factor for a self-
attenuation in the measured sample compared with the certified reference material, K4 is the correction factor for pulse loss due to random summing, and K5 is the coincidence correction factor for the nuclides that decay viaa cascade of successive photon emissions. N, the cor- rected net peak area of the corresponding photopeak, can be expressed using the following equation:
@2
where Ns is the net peak area in the sample spec- trum, Nb is the corresponding net peak area in the  background spectrum, ts is the live time of the sample spectrum collection (sec), and tb is the live time of the background spectrum collection (sec).
The measurement results were evaluated using the average of the activity. The standard for traceability was evaluated by the following equation [9]:@3
where VN is the NIST value, VR is the reported value, uc(N) is the standard combined uncertainty of the NIST value, uc(R) is the standard combined uncertainty of the laboratory value, and    3      u2 (N)    u2 (R)  is the traceability limit (limit to which measurement traceability may be claimed with 99% confidence). ANSI/HPS N13.30 defines the radiobioassay accep- tance criterion with respect to relative bias Br and rel- ative precision SB [9–10,15]:

@6where Br is the relative bias of the laboratory’s measure- ment for the complete set of N samples (with N 5 as the minimum), Bri is the relative bias of the measure- ment for sample i, Ci is the laboratory’s measured activ- ity concentration, and Csi is the NIST spike activity con- centration. The relative precision of the laboratory’s set of measurements is given by

3.Results and discussion
3.1.Results of synthetic urine sample analysis
Table 3 lists the massic activity and evaluation results of synthetic urine CE. Massic activity calculations were based on the sample mass and spiked activity supplied by the NRIP. For synthetic urine CE, the minimum detectable activities (MDAs) were 0.119 Bq sample−1 for 57Co, 0.131 Bq sample−1 for 60Co, and 0.105 Bq sample−1 for 137Cs.
The urine samples in 2012 contained 60Co and 137Cs radionuclides. The average activity of 60Co and 137Cs were 231.0 9.2 Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 4.0%) and 309.0 13.0 Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 4.2%), respectively. The relative expanded uncertainty was obtained by multiplying by the standard uncertainty (uncertainty interval of 95% confidence, coverage factor of k = 2). A comparison of

the reported and NIST values indicated relative biases of 0.9% for 60Co and 2.2% for 137Cs.
Radionuclides 57Co, 60Co, and 137Cs were present in the 2013 urine samples. The average activity of 57Co, 60Co, and 137Cs were 1.314  1.7 Bq g−1  (rela-   tive expanded uncertainty: 129.0%), 156.5  13.5 Bq  g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 8.6%), and 227.5
25.0 Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 11.0%), respectively. In this case, the activity of 60Co was the same as the NIST value, and the relative bias of 137Cs was  3.7%; thus, our results were in good agreement. In contrast, the uncertainty of 57Co was quite large and the activity differed from the NIST value by 18%. The activity of 57Co was low (NIST value: 1.599 Bq g−1) and the difference in massic activity was 0.285 Bq g−1. This was attributed to the uncertainty in the net counts (i.e. the relative expanded uncertainty increased when the activity was low).
The urine samples in 2014 supplied by the NIST con- tained 60Co and 137Cs. The average activities of 60Co and 137Cs were 217.4 37.2 Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 17.1%) and 376.9   37.7 Bq g−1   (rela-   tive expanded uncertainty: 10.0%), respectively. As a result of the evaluation, the relative biases of 60Co and 137Cs were 4.9% and 2.0%, respectively. For all urine CE samples from 2012 to 2014, the results were in good agreement with NIST values within 5% and sat- isfied ANSI N42.22 and ANSI/HPS N13.30 acceptance criteria.
Table 4 shows the sample activity and the evaluation results of urine EPE, which were performed in 2013 and 2014. The radionuclides present in the synthetic urine samples were 60Co and 137Cs for both years. For urine EPE, the MDAs were 0.648 Bq sample−1 for 60Co and 0.475 Bq sample−1 for 137Cs. The activity of each
sample varied. For example, the minimum activity for 60Co was 16.6 Bq sample−1 and the maximum activ- ity was 34.0 Bq sample−1 in 2013. The 2014 EPE results showed a similar tendency for the activity level of 60Co, ranging from 26.1 Bq sample−1 to 45.2 Bq sample−1. The sample activity level was classified with maximum, medium, and minimum values. The maximum values were about twice that of the minimum values. The mea- surement results were evaluated by the mean relative bias; thus, evaluation of traceability and relative pre- cision was not possible for the EPE [9]. The reported values were compared with NIST values. The evalua- tion results indicated differences between the NIST val- ues and reported values, expressed as a relative percent- age. All measured results were in good agreement with NIST values, with less than 10% difference. Therefore, these results indicated that our measurement approach was capable of rapidly and accurately measuring the radionuclide concentrations in biosamples in the event of a radiation emergency.
3.2.Results of synthetic faeces sample analysis
Table 5 lists the massic activity and evaluation results for the synthetic faeces  CE,  performed  from  2013  to 2014. For synthetic faeces CE, the MDAs were
0.066 Bq sample−1 for 54Mn, 0.074 Bq sample−1 for 60Co, 0.046 Bq sample−1 for 134Cs, and 0.042 Bq sample−1 for 137Cs.
In 2013, 54Mn, 60Co, and 134Cs were detected in   the  faeces  samples,  with  activities  of  5.2   2.0  Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 39%), 103.5
5.9 Bq g−1  (relative expanded uncertainty: 5.7%), and
40.4 2.0 Bq g−1 (relative  expanded  uncertainty:  4.9%), respectively. The measured results for 54Mn and
Table 5. Massic activity of synthetic faeces CE and evaluation results.
134Cs were in good agreement within 3.2% with NIST values, whereas the reported values of 60Co were differ- ent from the NIST values by about 9% on average. These results were confirmed via traceability using the ANSI N42.22 standard. However, the relative precision evalu- ation was not performed in 2013 because the reported values were small in number. At least five results were required for the relative precision evaluation.
In 2014, 60Co and 137Cs were detected in the faeces samples, with activities of 146.4  19.3 Bq g−1  (rela-  tive expanded uncertainty: 13.2%) and 257.8 20.1 Bq g−1 (relative expanded uncertainty: 7.8%), respectively. All measured results were in good agreement with NIST values. The evaluated results for 60Co in 2014 had improved over 2013 values, with the relative bias decreasing from 9.0% in 2013 to 3.9% in 2014. The measurement accuracy of the 2014 results was con- firmed by ANSI N42.22 and ANSI/HPS N13.30 accep- tance criteria.
4.Conclusion
KIRAMS participated in the NRIP for bioassay per- formance evaluation from 2012 to 2014. We estab- lished procedures of bioassay radioactivity mea- surements, including pretreatment of biosamples, measurement of samples, and result evaluation. The measurement results well agreed with NIST values, within 5% difference in 60Co and 137Cs concentration and 18% in 57Co concentration for urine CE samples and with less than 10% difference for the urine EPE. The activity of 60Co in faeces samples differed from the NIST value by 9%, whereas the results for 54Mn and 134Cs were within 3.2%. For all the samples capable of traceability and relative bias and precision evaluations (all urine CE samples and some faeces CE samples), all the measured results satisfied ANSI N42.22 and  ANSI/HPS N13.30 acceptance criteria.
The measurement results indicated that our pro- cedures were capable of rapidly and accurately mea- suring the radionuclide concentration in biosamples in the event of a radiation emergency. Radioactivity measurement procedures of urine and faeces samples given in this study can be applied to assess intake of radionuclides and resulting radiation dose to internally
contaminated casualties. Such capabilities should be available for radiation emergency preparedness.
