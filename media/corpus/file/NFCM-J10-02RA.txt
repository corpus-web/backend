Abstract
This work demonstrates the labelling of a novel class of iridium lumophore with radioiridium, as proof-of-feasibility for producing and using the medically useful isotope iridium-192. Natural osmium was electroplated onto silver target backings in basic media and irradiated for up to two hours with ≤20 μA of 12.8 MeV protons. A range of iridium isotopes were generated, characterized and quantified using γ-spectroscopy methods. The target material was removed from the backings via oxidative dissolution with hydrogen peroxide, and the iridium radioisotopes isolated using an anion exchange resin. Both no-carrier-added as well as carrier-added formulations were then used in subsequent cyclometalation reactions.

1. Introduction
Radiometals have opened new fields of study in nuclear medicine, taking advantage of their varied chemical and nuclear properties to enable both imaging and therapeutic applications (Rey, 2010, Thorp-Greenwood and Coogan, 2011). Multi-functional radiopharmaceuticals (RP) enable simultaneous applications across imaging or therapy modalities, with many emerging RPs based on a metallic radionuclide as either the signalling and/or therapeutic component. With ~80% of the known elements classifying as metal in nature, a large array of chelate chemistry has been developed over time. A number of avenues are therefore available to facilitate different labelling scenarios, including incorporation of metallic radioisotopes into targeting moieties that range from small molecule constructs to large biological target vectors (i.e. peptides, proteins, antibodies, etc.). The goal of this work was to produce, isolate and apply iridium-192, and demonstrate its use through cyclometalate chemistry to achieve a new, highly emissive, multifunctional RP for further study.
Luminescence cell imaging (LCI) is a cell histology technique that uses high resolution optical microscopy to image emissive compounds, generating detailed cell micrographs that are used to visualize the molecular interactions of a compound with the host. This technique has been integrated into multifunctional radiopharmacy, with many examples working in conjunction with PET or SPECT (Brindle, 2008, Chiang et al., 2012, Thorp-Greenwood and Coogan, 2011).
The excellent photophysical properties of iridium cyclometalate compounds (Chi and Chou, 2010) have generated interest for their use in LCI (Lo and Zhang, 2012, Thorp-Greenwood, 2012). Both the cyclometalating and ancillary ligands are easily modified to include biological targeting moieties (Lo et al., 2013, Mandal et al., 2012, Steunenberg et al., 2012). Despite the current relevance of such a project, to the best of our knowledge, a radiosynthesis of an iridium cyclometalate compound has not yet been reported. This may be due to the impractical conditions of the conventional synthesis, including lengthy (>10 h) reflux, use of dehalogenating agents and difficult post-reaction workup (Sprouse et al., 1984). However, new developments in microwave synthesis, along with improvements in aqueous organometallic chemistry, have dramatically reduced reaction times (Alam et al., 2013, Konno and Sasaki, 2003, Saito et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2010) and have opened a growing number of metal transformations that can be achieved in aqueous media and in the presence of oxygen.
Iridium-192 (T1/2=73.8 d; EC 4.8%; β− 95.2%; Eβmax=179 keV) currently plays a role in nuclear medicine, albeit somewhat far from targeted radiopharmacy. Using neutron activation of a 191Ir wire, low specific activity 192Ir brachytherapy sources are routinely generated and used globally for the treatment of several cancers (Habrand et al., 1991, Mate et al., 1998, Rostelato et al., 2008). Proton, deuteron, and alpha particle-induced reactions have also been demonstrated in the production of this isotope (Hilgers et al., 2005, Szelecsényi et al., 2010, Tárkányi et al., 2007). Specifically, the excitation function of the 192Os(p,n)192Ir reaction has been published (Hilgers et al., 2005, Szelecsényi et al., 2010) (Fig. 1) and represents the most easily accessible transmutation method. Hilgers et al. (2005) compared the cyclotron production of 192Ir against neutron-induced, reactor-based production with regard to the manufacture of brachytherapy sources. Reactor production was found, for this purpose, to have a higher cross-section and lower co-production of the long-lived metastable 192mIr (T1/2=241 a) (Hilgers et al., 2005). In vivo applications with RPs, however, typically require a higher specific activity that may only be achieved using particle accelerators.

Here we report a complete methodology for the production of radio-iridium on a low energy medical cyclotron, its radiochemical isolation, and the labelling of representative cyclometalate compounds.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and instrumentation
Naturally abundant powdered osmium metal (99.95%, 20 mesh; isotopic composition shown in Table 1) and iridium trichloride hydrate (IrCl3·3H2O) were purchased from Alfa Aesar International (Ward Hill MA, USA). All solvents, acids, bases and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Oakville ON, Canada) and used as received. Conventional column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Silicycle, 230–400 mesh), while anion exchange chromatography was performed using Biorad 1×8 anion exchange resin. Microwave reactions were performed on a Biotage Initiator system. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker AV400 instrument at 298 K, and mass spectra were obtained with the positive ion mode electro-spray ionization [ESI(+)] source on an Agilent 6210 time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) system. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separations were performed on an Agilent 1200 instrument with a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column, a UV detector set to 250 nm, and a Gabi NaI γ-ray detector. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) was performed on a FEI Dualbeam 235 instrument.

2.2. Target preparation
Targets were prepared as described previously (Chakrabarty et al., 2001, Greenspan, 1969, Hilgers et al., 2005, Szelecsényi et al., 2010). Briefly, 500 mg of OsO4 was placed in 2 mL of nitric acid and brought to reflux in a distillation apparatus at atmospheric pressure. The OsO4 vapor formed was absorbed by a receiving solution of deionized (DI) H2O. The low pH of this solution was adjusted to neutral with a 12 M solution of KOH. An aliquot was then added to an aqueous electrolyte bath containing sulphamic acid (H3NSO3, 0.908 g, 9.35 mmol), disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4, 0.167 g, 1.18 mmol), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.165 g, 4.13 mmol) to achieve a total volume of 65 mL. The resulting brown solution was brought to reflux for 5 min, after which a color change to yellow was observed. A portion of this bath was set aside to act as a replenishing solution during the electroplating.
Elemental silver target plates were machined to discs of 35 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness. A target plate holder was fashioned to mask a geometry matching that of the cyclotron beam (10 mm diameter). The entire holder was then submerged in the electrolytic bath and the system brought to 70–80 °C with vigorous stirring. A voltage and current of 3.0 V and 50 mA were applied, respectively, for 90 min and replenishing solution added as needed.
2.3. Target irradiation
All irradiations were performed on the TRIUMF TR13 cyclotron, a 13 MeV, self-shielded negative hydrogen ion cyclotron. Targets were mounted in a module specifically designed for this TR13 cyclotron (Fig. 2). The target interfaced directly with the cyclotron extraction port, separated from the cyclotron vacuum by a 25 µm aluminum foil. The aluminum entrance foil and the beam side of the target plate were each cooled with a 65 L min−1 at 10 psig helium jet directed at the center of the foil and target, and the target back side with 6 L min−1 flow of water. The energy of protons incident on the target face was 12.8 MeV, as determined by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) software package (Ziegler et al., 2008). Irradiations used to gather cross section data were performed at 5 μA for 1 h; production runs used for labelling chemistry were performed at 20 μA for 2 h. Targets were left in the shielded cyclotron for 24 h after the end of bombardment (EOB) to allow for the decay of short-lived isotopes. This cool-down period was followed by measurement of gamma-ray spectra to identify and quantify the activity produced.

2.4. Gamma ray spectroscopy
All gamma spectra were measured on a 120 cm3 coaxial high purity germanium (HPGe) detector (1.77 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV). Efficiency calibrations were performed with a 152Eu standard source at geometries required to maintain typical detector dead times of less than 12%. The peak-area analysis was performed with the Genie-2000 software package (Canberra), referencing a gamma ray library populated with iridium isotope data taken from the NuDat 2.6 database (NuDat 2.6 Database). The energy lines used in the isotopic analysis are included in Table 2, and were chosen according to the calibration range (120–1430 keV) and their relative intensity.

2.5. Radiochemical separation
Immediately following collection of the γ-ray spectra, irradiated targets were taken to a shielded fumehood and heated to ~200 °C until the conversion of metallic osmium to its oxides was observed, visible as a shift from dark grey to off-white. 100 μL of hydrogen peroxide (35% aqueous solution) was applied to the target face, dissolving the bulk of the osmium oxide from the silver backing. The target was then rinsed with 2×500 μL of 6 M HCl, which was then combined with the peroxide fraction. The resulting solution was refluxed for 1.5 h in a microwave reactor set to high absorption and then loaded onto an anion exchange column, equilibrated and eluted with 6 M HCl. The elution profile is shown in Fig. 3. The eluate was reduced in volume by boiling and neutralized with Na2CO3 for compatibility with subsequent cyclometalate chemistry. Stripped targets were measured with γ-ray spectroscopy methods to quantify the removal efficiency.

2.6. Synthetic chemistry
Synthesis of non-radioactive compounds [1] and [2] (Fig. 4) were performed with minor adjustments to reported procedures for non-radioactive iridium complexes (Alam et al., 2013, Bura et al., 2013, Wu et al., 2010). The products were purified and characterized fully with NMR, MS, UV–vis, and a program developed for their separation via HPLC.

2.7. [(ppy)2Ir(μ-Cl)2Ir(ppy)2] – Compound [1]
IrCl3·nH2O (53.4 mg, 151 μmol) and phenylpyridine (ppy) (56.7 mg, 365 μmol) were dissolved in a 6/1 mixture of ethylene glycol/de-ionized water, and the solution placed in a microwave reactor for 30 min at 135 °C. The bright yellow precipitate formed was isolated by vacuum filtration, washed twice with both water and ethanol, and used without further purification. Yield: 65% (52.6 mg, 49.1 μmol). 1H NMR (400 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ 9.24 (dd, J=5.8, 0.8 Hz, 4H), 7.87 (d, J=7.9 Hz, 4H), 7.73 (td, J=7.8, 1.6 Hz, 4H), 7.48 (dd, J=7.8, 1.1 Hz, 4H), 6.71 (m, 8H), 6.56 (td, J=7.8, 1.4 Hz, 4H), 5.93 (dd, J=7.8, 0.8 Hz, 4H). ESI-MS calc’d for [Ir2C44H32N4Cl2]: 1072.10, found: 537.1 [IrC22H16N2Cl]+ (50%), 501.1 [IrC22H16N2]+ (100%).
2.8. Ir(ppy)2(bpy) – Compound [2]
Compound [1] (44.0 mg, 41 μmol) and bipyridine (bpy) (14 mg, 9.0 μmol) were dissolved in 2-ethoxyethanol and irradiated in a microwave reactor for 15 min at 135 °C. The resulting orange product was purified by column chromatography (DCM: MeOH 9:1). Yield: 11% (11.2 mg, 16.2 μmol). 1H NMR (400 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ 9.48 (d, J=8.7 Hz, 2H), 8.27 (t, J=7.9 Hz, 2H), 7.91 (m, J=6.7 Hz, 4H), 7.76 (td, J=7.9, 1.4 Hz, 2H), 7.69 (dd, J=7.9, 1.0 Hz, 2H), 7.49 (d, J=5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.37 (m, 2H), 7.04 (td, J=7.6, 1.1 Hz, 2H), 7.00 (ddd, J=7.4, 5.8, 1.3 Hz, 2H), 6.92 (td, J=7.4, 1.3 Hz, 2H), 6.30 (dd, J=7.5, 0.8 Hz, 2H). ESI-MS calc’d for [IrC32H24N4]: 656.79, found: 657.1 [IrC32H24N4]+ (100%).
2.9. Radiosynthesis of compound [2]
A 0.834 mM solution of IrCl3·nH2O was prepared and a 500 μL aliquot (0.417 μmol) added to a microwave vial, as well as a 250 μL aliquot of the radio-iridium solution. 20 μL phenylpyridine (0.14 mmol) was added in excess, forming a separate organic phase. This mixture was reacted in the microwave for 30 min at 130 °C; a yellow color was observed in the organic phase, which was sampled with the aqueous phase for HPLC analysis. Bpy (7.3 mg, 0.047 mmol) was added and the solution reacted in the microwave for 15 min at 130 °C. Both phases were again sampled for HPLC analysis and offline γ-ray spectroscopy methods to quantify the distribution of activity. This experiment was performed in triplicate, and the desired product observed in each case.
3. Discussion of results
3.1. Targetry and isotope production
Electrodeposition of osmium produced thin coatings ranging from 14 to 27 mg in mass, consistent with literature reports (Chakrabarty et al., 2001, Szelecsényi et al., 2010, Tárkányi et al., 2007). Assuming a uniform coating over the surface, theoretical density was used in all calculations due to the constant number density per cm2. SRIM calculations showed that 12.8 MeV protons incident on a 10 µm osmium layer were attenuated by 0.36 MeV. This attenuation is sufficiently small to justify the use of thin target calculations. Full stopping was simulated to occur at 358 µm into the silver backing, which is easily accommodated by the 1 mm target plate. For safety considerations, we considered the most significant byproduct cross sections to be the 107Ag(p,n)107Cd and 109Ag(p,n)109Cd reactions in natural silver. Thick target yields for each were calculated using literature values, and the results included in Table 3 (Mukhammedov et al., 1984, Sadeghi et al., 2009).

Isotope	Activity generated, by irradiation condition	Ref. Ebeam (MeV)
5 μA h	40 μA h
107Cd	29 mCi (1.07 GBq)	232.4 mCi (8.60 GBq)	12.0
109Cd	9.4 μCi (0.35 MBq)	75.2 μCi (2.78 MBq)	15.0
All iridium isotopes (A=186–190, 192) were generated from proton-induced reactions on naturally abundant osmium (Table 1) and observed in γ-ray spectra gathered 24 h post EOB. Irradiated targets were placed in any of several calibrated geometries that allowed detector dead times of 10 – 12%. The isotopic identities were confirmed with decay data by comparison to spectra gathered at later time points, and their quantities determined using peak-area analysis of the key lines included in Table 2. To correlate our results to literature values, we measured the on-plate activity of 192Ir from two 5 μA h irradiations, and calculated the cross section for its production. The resulting average cross section of 46.4±6.2 mb compares well with literature values of 47±5 mb at 12.5±0.4 MeV (Hilgers et al., 2005), and 52.3±5.7 mb at 12.2±0.5 MeV (Szelecsényi et al., 2010). The yields measured from this run are included in Table 4.

190	6.39	0.53	5.82	0.24
192	0.890	0.076	0.973	0.042
3.2. Radiochemical separation
The radiochemical process described herein gave rise to the elution chromatogram shown in Fig. 3. Sampling and offline quantification of activity at various stages of the process were used to calculate an overall radiochemical efficiency of ~80%, from the removal of the irradiated material from the target plate through to the elution of the radio-iridium from the purification column.
Published data shows IrCl62− to adsorb similarly to OsCl62− on Dowex 1×8 with Dv ~103, while IrCl63− shows negligible retention (Campbell and Nelson, 1956); where Dv is the distribution coefficient quantifying the affinity of the metal ion for the column material. Lack of radio-osmium product from this bombardment forced the use of non-radiometric determinations of osmium breakthrough. Qualitatively, the formation of OsCl6 was visible as a red-brown color of the reflux solution; a band of the same color was visible on the anion-exchange column after the separation was complete. Quantitatively, ICP-MS techniques may be employed, however the irradiated samples must be allowed to decay to safe disposal levels (10×t1/2) before measurement, which in the case of 192Ir is approximately 2 years.
With off-line γ-ray spectroscopy methods the radionuclidic purity of the eluted radio-iridium was determined to be 100%, with no observed activity from any other isotope. The anion exchange process is therefore also selective against the cadmium contaminants, as their characteristic lines were observed in the spectra collected from the pre-column solution.
3.3. Cyclometalate chemistry
Compound [1] was first synthesized by reacting the cyclometalating ligand ppy with non-radioactive iridium trichloride hydrate in a microwave reactor, according to a slightly modified literature procedure. After isolating [1], compound [2] was afforded by reaction under similar conditions with the ancillary ligand bpy. Once convinced of the purity of both compounds via NMR and MS, a standard HPLC program was developed to isolate them (Fig. 5). It was also found that both reactions progressed while using deionized water as the solvent, and this approach was adopted for the radiosynthesis.
Fig. 5. Overlaid radio (top, blue) and UV (bottom, red) chromatograms of products [1] and [2]. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
It was assumed that at no-carrier-added concentrations the dimerization reaction would not progress, requiring the addition of IrCl3·3H2O as a natIr carrier. Due to the high UV absorption coefficient and ease of detection of both cyclometalate compounds, we attempted to determine reaction behaviour at lower reaction concentration prior to using radio-iridium. Water and ppy form a biphasic system, and so IrCl3.nH2O from the aqueous layer reacted with ppy at the interface to form [1], which was in turn solubilized by ppy. Similar to a previous attempt at a one pot reaction (Ladouceur et al., 2011), bpy was added to this reaction mixture to afford [2], as confirmed with UV-HPLC.
Finally, the radio-synthesis proceeded by adding an aliquot of the radioactive [IrCl6]3− solution to the aqueous layer of the reaction mixture described above, and the same steps applied. The critical assumption in this step was the similar treatment of IrCl3·nH2O and [IrCl6]3−. The results of γ-HPLC of [1] and [2] are shown in Fig. 5, overlaid on the UV traces of their respective purified products. A variety of side products are visible in the production of [1], however upon addition of the ancillary ligand, [2] appears as the dominant product with no labeled products following. The γ-HPLC time signature of the earlier by-products did not match any reaction component previously observed. The chromatogram of unreacted [IrCl6]3− shows a single strong peak at 3.50 min, however the absence of this peak from the analyses of either step of the reaction suggests some competing reaction, perhaps incomplete cyclometalation.
Data from off-line γ-ray spectroscopy was combined with the HPLC analyses to determine several radiochemical reaction parameters. All HPLC data refers to the aqueous fraction of the reaction, as the strong UV absorption of the organic fraction saturated the detector and did not allow for quantification of any following compounds; for this reason the radiochemical yield was not calculated. The UV-HPLC absorption of [2] was translated to its concentration with a calibration curve, and a maximum specific activity of 0.54±0.14 Ci μmol−1 (20±5.2 GBq μmol−1) calculated. This value reflects the total activity of all iridium isotopes present. The radiochemical purity of the reaction was obtained from the peak integration of the γ-HPLC and was demonstrated to be as high as 68%. This variability may be due to inconsistent mixing of the organic and aqueous fractions, a hypothesis supported by varying activity ratios between the two fractions across the three trials.
At this stage of the research, the complications of the two-phase solvent system outweigh the advantages of an aqueous reaction. Future work will revert to the traditional solvents used in cyclometalation reactions. This work has enabled a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of iridium cyclometalate formation, and experiments with no carrier added reactions may give some insight to this field.
4. Conclusions
Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the cyclotron production, chemical purification and cyclometalate complexation of iridium radioisotopes. To our knowledge, this is the first literature report of a cyclometalation reaction involving radio-iridium, potentiating a novel class of multifunctional radiopharmaceutical based on a versatile platform of cyclometalate chemistry. This research opens the door to a variety of applications in molecular imaging and nuclear therapy.
