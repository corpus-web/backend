Pb-covered samples in oxidizing environments have comparatively lower release rates of I.
<Section>Abstract</Section>
Tests of fission product release under accident conditions were performed on three samples of irradiated UO2 fuel fragments immersed in molten Pb. Two tests of bare irradiated UO2 fragment samples were conducted under similar conditions for direct comparison. The irradiated fuel samples had been cooled for several years, then encapsulated and trace-reirradiated to populate limited inventories of short-lived fission products (such as 133Xe and 131I). The tests were conducted with sample temperatures between 1570 and 1590 K. The releases from Pb-covered samples under inert conditions were similar to those from bare UO2 under inert conditions. Greater 133Xe releases were observed from Pb-covered samples in oxidizing environments. Release of 140Ba was detected for the Pb-covered sample exposed to air. Under oxidizing conditions, Pb-covered samples retained more 137Cs and 103Ru (delayed onset of release in air and complete retention in steam) as well as 131I.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) is one of the six reactor systems chosen by the Generation IV (GEN IV) International Forum (GIF) for further development and deployment between 2020 and 2030 (GIF Portal, 2019, Generation IV Nuclear, 2019). Reactors classified as LFR use molten metal as the primary coolant, either lead or lead–bismuth eutectic (LBE), and fission is predominately produced from neutrons in the fast portion of the neutron energy spectrum. Research has largely focused on understanding the potential corrosion of structural, heat exchanger, and fuel cladding materials interacting with liquid lead or LBE coolant (Fazio et al., 2015). Additional work has gone into experimental programs that examine potential core-disruptive accidents (Wang, 2017).
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and its successor organization Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) have a long-term hot-cell experimental program in which irradiated fuel is exposed to various environments (argon, steam, and air) at high temperatures (670 K to 2200 K) in furnaces (Hunt et al., 1986, Dickson et al., 2008). These tests have primarily focused on UO2 fuel, which is typically used in light water reactor (LWRs) as well as pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs). The application of GEN IV technology to small modular reactor (SMR) systems that are being commercialized will require knowledge of the fission product release (FPR) behavior under severe accident conditions for these reactor systems. A literature review of work undertaken at CNL produced reports on lead fission product retention for naval reactors, but these reports are not readily available in the open literature. A series of studies of fission product retention at 1073 K has also been conducted at Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden) (Jolkkonen, 2013).
Experimental methods developed for UO2 were applied to three samples to examine fission product release from lead-cooled UO2 fuel under severe accident conditions. The samples consisted of unsheathed fragments of irradiated UO2 fuel submerged in molten lead; the cladding was assumed to have melted or dissolved in the high-temperature lead. These conditions demonstrate that the FPR experimental methodology developed for PHWRs and LWRs can be applied to SMR technology. This set of tests also provides the initial data required to produce FPR models similar to CORSOR/CORSOR-M (Silberberg et al., 1985) used within severe accident analysis codes (e.g., MELCOR (Humphries et al., 2017) to determine the source term for LFR systems. The test temperature (in excess of 1550 K) was well above proposed LFR coolant operating temperatures and would reflect conditions relevant to beyond-design-basis accidents.
The tests were performed as part of the Grain Boundary Inventory Experiment #7 (GBI7) hot-cell experiment, which was primarily dedicated to measuring grain boundary inventories (GBI) of noble gases in solid fuels. Five tests were conducted to examine the fission product release behavior at approximately 1570 K to 1590 K (Table 1). In two tests, bare UO2 fragments were examined, whereas the three other tests were performed on UO2 fragments that would initially be submerged in liquid lead (melting point 600.6 K). The liquid lead had a volume of 5.28 cm3 (assuming 1580 K) (Kirshenbaum et al., 1961). Including the volume of the UO2, the lead pool was expected to be ~0.67 cm deep at the bottom of the sample boat, which is considerably less than the lead pool depth that would apply during a reactor accident. The effects of lead on FPR in these tests would probably be even more accentuated during an accident in an LFR. Tests LF1 and LF5 were performed on uncovered UO2 to provide a direct comparison of the lead-covered samples to the better-studied system of UO2 in inert and oxidizing environments (Dickson et al., 2019, Dickson and Dickson, 2001). The test temperature was selected to be as high as possible while minimizing lead vaporization.

<Section>2. Materials and methods</Section>
2.1. Fuel samples and irradiation history
The UO2 fragments used in these tests were from 9 mm segments cut from a fuel pin/element that was initially irradiated as part of De-Mountable Element (DME) Experiment #217 (DME-217). DME-217 test fuel consisted of UO2 with a slight 235U enrichment (1.4 wt%). The UO2 pellets had an initial density of 98.7% theoretical density, an average grain diameter of 7.4 µm, a length of 16.9 mm, and a diameter of 12.19 mm. During the irradiation experiment, the fuel used in GBI7 had a sustained maximum linear element rating of 60 kW/m declining to 26 kW/m and achieved a burnup of 29.3 MWd/kgU (Floyd and Harrison, 2005). The fuel was discharged from the pressurized-water irradiation test loops of the National Research Universal (NRU) reactor on 2002 May 12. Gas puncture measurements after irradiation found that 9.2% (by volume) of the fission gas that had been released from the fuel during irradiation.
These 9 mm segments included the irradiated UO2 and the adjacent Zircaloy sheath. Following segmentation, Zircaloy end-caps were used to cover the cut ends of the fuel. The end-caps were tapered internally to provide a press fit. The purpose of the end-caps was to prevent fuel fragments from falling out of the sample. The end-caps also prevented immediate direct access of the sample environment to the bulk of the sample. The samples were then packed into stainless-steel capsules with high-thermal-conductivity flake graphite, evacuated, filled with helium, and sealed by welding. The encapsulated samples were then trace-reirradiated in the Nose Cone Irradiation Facility of the NRU reactor to build limited inventories of short-lived fission products (e.g., 133Xe and 131I). The irradiation occurred between 2017 November 8 and 2018 February 2 (equivalent to 43.5 days of operation at a reactor power of 120 MW spread over a period of 86 days). The last 13 days of irradiation at an average reactor power of 96 MW were interrupted for only 1 h. During this re-irradiation, the nominal linear power (at 120 MW reactor power) was 1.0 kW/m. With fuel temperatures of ~340 K during the trace-reirradiation, most of the radionuclides generated would remain within the fuel grains rather than segregate into different phases.
Following the trace re-irradiation, the encapsulated samples were transported to the shielded hot cell facilities. The fuel segments were removed from the stainless-steel capsules, the Zircaloy sheath was cracked open, and portions between ~9.4 and 12 g (Section 2.5) of the fragmented fuel were removed for use in subsequent tests. These fragments had the appearance of a coarse, dark powder (containing chips up to 3 mm in size).
2.2. High-temperature testing apparatus
The apparatus for the GBI7 experiment (Fig. 1) was similar to that of Hot Cell Experiment #4 (HCE4) (Dickson and Dickson, 2001) and Hot Cell Experiment #6 (HCE6) (Dickson et al., 2019). Flow rates of argon and air were monitored using mass flowmeters (Matheson, 8172 series). A Matheson PUR-Gas cartridge purifier was used to remove oxygen and water vapor from the argon gas before the gas entered the hot cell.
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of GBI7 experimental apparatus.
For the test involving steam, deionized water was pumped at a rate of 30 g/h from a reservoir outside the cell to a glass nebulizer (isoSPEC, model iso-500-81). The nebulizer was also connected to an argon supply that flowed at 0.27 mmol/s. The nebulizer was inserted into the furnace tube when the water and argon flows were turned off and before increasing the sample temperature. The test pressures ranged from 100.1 kPa to 119.0 kPa absolute pressure, with the higher pressures occurring during steam flow.
The horizontal tube furnace (Fig. 2) (Micropyretics Heaters International, model H18-40HT) had molybdenum disilicide heating elements and an out-cell temperature controller. The furnace was mounted on tracks to facilitate the unloading and loading of furnace tube assemblies, and with a reference location on the track, sample positioning in the line of sight of the direct-viewing γ-spectrometer was ensured with each new assembly. For these tests, the furnace tubes (outer diameter 69.85 mm) were made of 99.8% alumina. The upstream end-caps were held to the furnace tube with three toggle clamps, and sealed to the furnace tube using Viton O-rings. The load snout in the upstream end-cap also had a gas flow fitting (used for argon or air) near the upstream end. Sample position was controlled by an alumina pushrod containing a Type R thermocouple insulated using alumina twin-bore tubing (Fig. 2). The alumina sample boat attached to the pushrod was about 45 mm long × 21 mm wide × 15 mm deep (inner dimensions). The thermocouple junction was within 5 mm of the sample position. The furnace uniform hot zone (±5 K) was about 100 mm long and located at the center of the furnace.
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of furnace region of GBI7 experimental apparatus for tests LF1–LF5.
A small water-cooled condenser was located downstream of the outlet filter. Before each test, 75 mL of pH 10 buffer solution was added to the condenser to trap some volatile iodine species. The condenser was designed with sufficient capacity (~450 mL) that it did not need to be drained during a test (<2h of steam at 30 g/h). After each test, the condensate–buffer mixture was drained.
Following another stage of particulate filtration, the gas stream was passed through a coil of polyethylene tubing that ran outside the hot cell for noble gas measurement by γ-spectrometry, then back into the hot cell for a final filtration step and release of the gases to the hot cell ventilation system.
2.3. Data logging
The voltages from the thermocouples (Type K, which were used for heat tracing of temperature-sensitive components, and Type R) and pressure sensors (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) were logged using a datalogger (a 22-bit digital multimeter; Agilent 34970A) equipped with 16-channel multiplexers (Agilent 34902A) operating at 10 s intervals.
2.4. γ-Spectrometry
The spectrometers used in the GBI7 experiment were high-purity germanium γ-spectrometers of differing efficiencies. The direct-viewing γ-spectrometer was located at a ceiling plug at the top of the hot cell, and viewed the fuel specimen through the top of the furnace (Fig. 1). This spectrometer geometry was not calibrated for efficiency because fractional releases were calculated from count rates rather than calculated activities. Energy calibration was performed using at least seven peaks from a 152Eu source that ranged in energy from 122 keV to 1408 keV.
The two γ-spectrometers for monitoring the noble gases (called delay coil spectrometers) viewed the non-condensable portion of the furnace exhaust gas in a coil of ¼” (6.35 mm) outer diameter (14.4 mm2 inner cross-sectional area) polyethylene tubing, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. One of the spectrometers had a single pass of the polyethylene tubing running across the end of the spectrometer snout (zero-turn spectrometer), whereas the other spectrometer had a 10-turn coil of tubing wrapped around its snout (10-turn spectrometer). The efficiencies of these spectrometers were calibrated using commercially purchased custom sources (Eckert and Ziegler, 3.5% expanded uncertainty) containing 152Eu and 133Ba inside polyethylene tubing in the appropriate geometry.
2.5. Test conditions
The furnace tube and other apparatus components were leak-tested for 5 min and purged using purified argon before the start of each test. The furnace was heated to the test temperature before sample insertion to permit rapid sample heating. Background spectra using the direct-viewing and delay coil γ-spectrometers were also obtained before the test.
The boat containing the sample was inserted into the heated furnace tube after the argon purge. The nominal sample temperature was measured at the inlet end of the boat; the actual temperature at the outlet end may have been as much as 200 K higher. Durations above 600 K (the melting point of lead) measured temperature are referred to in the descriptions below because the entire sample would have been above 600 K for at least that duration. The lead used for tests LF2, LF3 and LF4 was from Alfa Aesar (10 mm rod, 99.999% purity metals basis).
2.5.1. Test LF1
For the LF1 test, a 9.363 g sample of UO2 fuel was inserted into the furnace and heated to a maximum temperature of 1577 K in purified argon flowing at 0.28 mmol/s. The average heating rate of the sample between 448 K and 1573 K was 0.47 K/s. The sample was maintained between 1570 K and 1577 K for 3720 s. The sample was withdrawn in flowing purified argon at 6030 s.
2.5.2. Test LF2
The LF2 test sample consisted of 11.019 g of UO2 fuel and 49.769 g of lead. The UO2 was loaded into the boat first, and two pre-weighed lead rods were placed on top of the UO2. Initially the sample was heated from 448 K to 802 K to melt the lead; the time period between 600 K and 802 K was 730 s. The temperature was then ramped from 802 K to 1570 K at an average rate of 1.01 K/s. Both the lead melting and temperature ramp phases were with purified argon flowing at 0.27 mmol/s. At 2500 s the test atmosphere was switched to a steam environment and the feed water was pumped at 0.46 mmol/s and introduced into the furnace with unpurified argon flow gas at 0.36 mmol/s. During the steam exposure, the sample had an average temperature of 1568 K and reached a maximum temperature of 1571 K. The steam was shut off after 4200 s and the sample was withdrawn in flowing purified argon at 6490 s.
2.5.3. Test LF3
The LF3 test sample consisted of 11.214 g UO2 fuel, and 49.6622 g of lead. The UO2 was loaded into the boat first, and two pre-weighed lead rods were placed on top of the UO2. Initially the sample was heated from 450 K to 908 K to melt the lead; the time period between 600 K and 908 K was 620 s. The temperature was then ramped from 908 K to a maximum temperature of 1577 K at an average rate of 0.94 K/s. The test was conducted in an environment of purified argon with a flow rate of 0.028 mmol/s. Sample temperature was maintained between 1577 K and 1573 K for 3560 s. The sample was withdrawn in flowing purified argon at 5380 s.
2.5.4. Test LF4
The LF4 test sample consisted of 11.120 g UO2 fuel and 49.5868 g of lead. The UO2 was loaded into the boat first, and two pre-weighed lead rods were placed on top of the UO2. Initially the sample was heated from 417 K to 772 K to melt the lead; the time period between 600 K and 772 K was 550 s. The sample temperature was then ramped from 772 K to 1573 K at an average rate of 1.3 K/s. The lead melting and temperature ramps proceeded in an environment of purified argon with an average flow rate of 0.28 mmol/s. The environment was switched at 3120 s to air with an average flow rate of 0.25 mmol/s for 3790 s. During this oxidation period, the fuel sample reached a maximum temperature of 1588 K and had an average temperature of 1582 K. The air was switched back to purified argon with an average flow rate of 0.28 mmol/s, and the sample was withdrawn from the furnace in flowing purified argon at 7480 s.
2.5.5. Test LF5
For the LF5 test, a 12.058 g sample of UO2 fuel was inserted into the furnace and heated to a target temperature of temperature of 1573 K in purified argon flowing at 0.28 mmol/s. The average heating rate of the sample between 464 K and 1573 K was 0.70 K/s. At 1950 s the argon environment was switched to air flowing at 0.28 mmol/s for 3690 s. During the oxidation period, the sample reached a maximum temperature of 1578 K and had an average temperature of 1584 K. The air flow was switched back to purified argon with an average flow rate of 0.27 mmol/s, and the sample was withdrawn from the furnace in flowing purified argon at 5930 s.
<Section>3. Calculations</Section>
3.1. Non-noble-gas fission products
3.1.1. Release calculation
Fission-product release percentages (Rt) were calculated from changes in count rates of selected peaks and background measurements taken with the direct-viewing γ-spectrometer (Dickson et al., 2008) with respect to count rates during a standard period during the first direct-viewing γ-detector observation of the test, as shown in Eq. (1).
@(1)
where
Is is the initial count rate from the sample and background during the standard period,
It is the count rate from the sample and background at time t during the test,
Bs is the background count rate during the standard period,
Bt is the background count rate during the test (assumed to be constant),
ct is the decay correction factor, and
kt is the normalization factor obtained from the 487 keV or 1596 keV count rate of 140La or the 757 keV count rate of 95Zr.
For each test, the count rates from the first direct-viewing spectrum were used as the standards (Is) in Eq. (1). As the standard spectrum was one of the test spectra, Bs and Bt are equal for the LF tests. For the oxidizing environment tests (LF2, LF4, and LF5), the environment was changed to either air or steam after two spectra were collected.
Normalization accounted for changes in sample geometry and attenuation by the use of count rates for isotopes that were known to have negligible releases under the test conditions (Dickson and Dickson, 2001). Neither 140La nor 95Zr would be significantly released from UO2 fuel under the temperature conditions in the tests (Barrand et al., 1999, Dickson et al., 2019, Dickson and Dickson, 2001, Ducros et al., 2013). The fractional releases for peaks beyond 800 keV are not reported in this paper because their counting statistics are weaker than those of the reported peaks for radionuclides of the same chemical element; however, these calculated fractional releases using the higher-energy peaks are included in the archived data. The k values for the tests were in the range 0.96–1.12 in all tests except LF4 (lead-covered and exposed to air), for which the range was 0.99–2.28; all three normalization values in LF4 increased from ~1 to plateau at a maximum value about 3000 s after the sample had reached the test temperature. The lowest-energy normalizing peaks were most affected by the change in sample geometry.
The uncertainties in the fractional releases for tests other than LF4 were calculated using the uncertainties in the count rates and the uncertainty of the normalization process (without accounting for possible differences in attenuation change as a function of energy).
3.1.2. Pb and normalization
The normalization factor () in Eq. (1) is intended to account for changes in the incident peak intensity caused by modifications to the sample geometry during a test. With the addition of Pb (a strong γ-ray attenuator) to the sample, the methods used for bare UO2 samples may not have been sufficient to represent this new configuration. Calculating the normalization for test LF4 from 140La and 95Zr peaks demonstrates that further examination is warranted. Fig. 3 presents normalization values (with corresponding vertical axis on the left) used to obtain the release percentages in the LF5, LF2, and LF4 tests. The blue (solid line), purple (short dash line), and green (long dash line) lines represent the values of  over the test duration. The red lines (solid line) are the sample temperatures (with corresponding vertical axis on the right).
Fig. 3. Comparison of normalization values used in oxidizing-environment tests (LF4 is plotted on a larger scale to highlight behavior during test).
In general, the normalization values in LF5 behave as in the previous fragment tests. LF1 and LF3 normalization values are very similar to that of LF5 in that they fluctuate around 1, whereas LF2 values start around 1 and increase until the test is finished, remaining consistent with behavior exhibited in previous experiments.
The LF4 normalization values demonstrate substantially different behavior. A primary source of this unusual behavior in LF4 is likely the oxidizing Pb. Lead oxide (PbO) has a greater vapor pressure than Pb and a lower boiling temperature (1745 K for PbO compared to 2024 K for Pb) (PubChem, 2020a). In preliminary laboratory tests to determine the procedures for air-oxidizing the samples, a significant quantity of Pb was found downstream in the furnace tube and the thimble filter. Pb vaporization would strongly affect the attenuation and normalization of the releases.
A second source of the normalization behavior in LF4 may be changes in density in the molten Pb/PbO. At 600.6 K molten Pb is 10.678 g/cm3, and at 1580 K the density is ~9.39 g/cm3 (Kirshenbaum et al., 1961). The density of PbO is ~9.5 g/cm3 at 293 K, and molten PbO is ~7.88 g/cm3 at 1393 K (Riebling, 1964, PubChem, 2020a). These changes in density will affect the attenuation behavior of the molten pool above the UO2.
A third source of the normalization behavior in LF4 may be changes in UO2 density. Following the initial irradiation of the UO2 and based on the calculated composition of the fuel, it has a theoretical density of ~10.17 g/cm3. Oxidation to UO2+x would slightly increase the density (Schaner, 1960). If the fuel were to remain in these oxidation states, it would be expected to reside at the bottom of the sample boat. However, the volume of U3O8 (the stable phase in air at 1580 K) is 36% greater than the volume of UO2 (McEachern and Taylor, 1998) (which decreases the sample density to ~7.48 g/cm3). The possibility of the oxidized fuel in the sample becoming buoyant in the molten Pb also needs to be considered. Sectioning of the LF4 sample boat would provide an answer to what specifically occurred during the test. However, at this time, none of the phenomena can be ruled out.
Regardless of the physical phenomena driving the changes in sample geometry and attenuation, it can be assumed that the dominant factor in the normalization behavior in LF4 is changes in the Pb. This supposition can be drawn because of the relatively constant behavior in the normalization of LF5. The lower-energy normalization peaks are more affected than higher-energy peaks, which also points to Pb being the cause. In examining the Pb γ/X-ray attenuation, this can be expected as the attenuation coefficient decreases by two orders of magnitude over the γ energies measured during the test (Hubbell and Seltzer, 2004), with the greatest decrease in attenuation occurring between 80 keV and 500 keV γ-ray energies.
For lead-covered fuel samples, more normalization peaks may be required at lower γ energies to permit the normalization factors to address the greater changes in Pb attenuation for the energy region of ~100 keV to 600 keV. This could be achieved by doping the fuel samples with non-releasing isotopes with decay energies in this region, or by conducting tests with fuel samples that have been more recently discharged from their full-power irradiation.
An alternative method is to use the data from the measured normalization lines to derive a normalization estimate for the lower-energy γ-rays. Eq. (2) presents the usual formula for the normalization factor (Dickson et al., 2008).
@(2)
Terms are added to Eq. (2) to account for the inclusion of Pb in the samples. As a first approximation, the linear attenuation of γ-rays is applied to the numerator and denominator of Eq. (2) as shown in Eq. (3).
@(3)
where
@is the initial linear attenuation coefficient of Pb (cm−1),
@is the linear attenuation coefficient of Pb during the test (cm−1),
@ is the initial effective thickness of the Pb (cm), and
@is the effective thickness of the Pb during the test (cm).
The assumption that all of the change in the γ intensity is caused by the presence of Pb in the sample mathematically leads to , which simplifies Eq. (3) to yield Eq. (4).
@(4)
Without knowing the thickness of a possible layer of PbO, we assume in our analysis that the γ attenuation behaves as though Pb were the sole material (Hubbell and Seltzer, 2004). This assumption may cause the error associated with this normalization method to be underestimated in the normal propagation of uncertainties. For LF4, the primary source of variation of  during the test is assumed to be the thermally driven changes in density of the Pb. During the direct-view γ observation in LF4, the Pb density range was calculated to be between 9.38918 g/cm3 and 9.37695 g/cm3. This leads to the average value of  for the 140La 1596 keV γ to be 0.47882 cm−1 and the standard deviation of  over the test to be 0.00018 cm−1 (which is factor of ~of the mean value). During a transient/temperature ramp test, significant variation in  may occur. However, for the purposes of further analysis of LF4,  is treated as a constant, which leads to Eq. (5).
@(5)
If a temperature ramp test were to be conducted, two different measurements of  from the same spectra collection could be used with Eq. (5) to determine  for the test.
As noted previously,  decreases greatly at the lower energies of the γ peaks observed during these tests. Specifically for the 364.5 keV γ energy observation of 131I,  is ~2.75 cm−1, whereas at the normalization peak used to generate the release percentage in Fig. 8 from the 140La 487 keV peak,  is ~1.60 cm−1. This indicates that the change in the 131I intensity is under-corrected in the original normalization scheme.
By inserting the measured  values from the 140La 1596 keV peak into Eq. (5), the changes in effective Pb thickness () during the test can be found. With the change in effective Pb thickness,  for the different peak energies can be found and more representative  values can be calculated. Fig. 4 presents a comparison between the initial normalization factor used in 131I release and the one calculated based on this effective Pb thickness assumption.

3.2. Noble gas fission products
The γ-ray peaks with the best count rate statistics were used to assess the release behavior of xenon and krypton: 133Xe 81 keV peak and 85Kr 514 keV peak. The γ count rates from the delay coil γ-spectrometers were decay-corrected to the start time of each test. The decay-corrected count rates (I) were used to calculate the released noble gas activities during each counting period (Dickson et al., 2003; Dickson et al., 2019) according to Eq. (6).
@(6)
where
@is the average release rate of the noble gas in the γ counting period (Bq/s),
@is the flow rate of the carrier gas through the delay coil (mL/min), and
@is the efficiency coefficient of the delay coil γ-spectrometer (cps/(Bq/mL)).
The timing for all the noble gas data was corrected to account for the transit time between the fuel and the delay coils. The counting time for each spectrum was 300 s.
Previous experiments (Dickson et al., 2019, Dickson and Dickson, 2001) showed that measured count rates for 133Xe were affected by sorption of Xe onto the delay-coil plastic tubing during the tests. The measured count rates for 133Xe were corrected to account for the impact of the sorbed 133Xe activity. The dependence of the 133Xe count rate on time was fitted by linear regression for the first three and last three spectra for each test. The releases of noble gases during these periods were negligible based on the temperature (<1200 K) and sample environment (argon). Count rate values derived from the regressions were subtracted from the measured 133Xe count rates, with the regression values from the first three spectra subtracted from the spectra before the observed 133Xe release peak and the regression values from the last three spectra subtracted from the peak spectrum and the spectra after it. This correction method was applied to the 133Xe release data analysis of the LF3, LF4, and LF5 tests. For the 133Xe analysis in LF2, insufficient spectra were obtained after the oxidation environment had been switched back to argon. Therefore, the count rate of the last spectrum was subtracted instead of the regression values of the last three count rates. Directly prior to conducting the LF1 test, the experimental apparatus had been used to examine the high-temperature FPR behavior of uranium–plutonium mixed-oxide fuel samples. A considerable amount of 131I had reached the delay coils during these tests, causing a substantial count rate at the 81 keV 131I γ peak in the delay coil spectra. The sorption correction in LF1 reduced the 81 keV 133Xe count rate by an order of magnitude, which increased the uncertainty in the measurement of 133Xe such that the measurements became unreliable. Following the LF1 test, the delay coil was changed out to avoid contaminated Xe and Kr measurements. In tests LF4 and LF5, sorbed 133Xe accounted for between 15% and 20% of the collected 133Xe counts. For LF3 the sorbed 133Xe accounted for 34% to 48% of the counts, similar to the behavior in other low-release tests (Dickson, 2019). The modified correction method for the LF2 data accounted for ~3.0% to 3.2% of the 133Xe counts.
The corrected delay-coil count rate data were combined with the flow rate data and spectrometer efficiency data to give total activities released during each spectrum time period, and to determine the time interval during which the noble gases measured in each spectrum were released from the fuel. The hydrogen generated by oxidation of fuel in steam was not accounted for in the flow rates.
The uncertainties in the noble gas measurements were calculated using uncertainties in the count rate, flow rate, and efficiency calibration. The main contributor was the uncertainty in the efficiency calibration. The uncertainty used for the sorption-corrected 133Xe measurements used the uncertainty from the original (uncorrected/larger) measurements.
<Section>4. Results</Section>
Plots of the observed FPR are presented in this section. The results for the 133Xe and 85Kr in the off-gas system in the delay coil spectrometers are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, respectively, followed by the results of the direct-view spectrometer for Cs (Fig. 7), I (Fig. 8), Ru (Fig. 9), and Ba (Fig. 10). Each figure is further organized with the inert-condition tests displayed first followed by the oxidizing-environment tests. The display order is as follows: inert tests LF1 (with the exception of the fission gases) and LF3, then oxidizing tests LF5, LF4, and LF2. Fig. 5, Fig. 6 display the measured release activities of 133Xe and 85Kr from the two separate detectors; the blue trace is for the measurement from the zero-turn detector, and the orange trace is for the measurement from the 10-turn detector. In Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, the red trace displays the time dependence of sample temperature (with scale on the right-hand vertical axis). Changes in oxidizing environment are indicated by the black vertical lines, with the oxidizing component of the atmosphere listed (steam or air). In Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, the release percentage (Equation (1)) is presented in blue. For test LF4 (Figs. 7d, 8d, 9d, and 10d), the dotted orange line indicates the release percentage calculated using the alternative normalization scheme from Section 3.1.2.

<Section>5. Discussion</Section>
5.1. LF4 normalization
The normalization scheme discussed in Section 3.1.2 appears to be beneficial. Evidence for this is that the behavior of the 131I release percentage between ~4500 s and 5500 s after applying the recalculated normalization factor (orange line in Fig. 8d) is physically more reasonable. The calculated 140Ba release is reduced by a factor of ~0.59 with the renormalization (from 18% to 10%). The other affected release percentage is that of Cs (increase from ~39% to ~44%). For the remaining release percentages presented in this work, the effects of the Pb are less prominent.
Following the removal of the LF4 sample from the center of the furnace tube where the γ observations occur, 95Zr and 140La γ peaks were observed. This suggests that a portion of the original UO2 sample was deposited outside the boat sometime during the LF4 test. The count rates for the 1569 keV peak for 140La were very low (0.7% of the initial count rate), indicating that a very small fraction of the initial UO2 was still being discerned by the γ detector. It is possible that a grain-sized portion of the UO2 sample spalled off as it oxidized to U3O8, became buoyant in the molten lead, and was deposited outside of the boat, and that the PbO vaporized. Recalculation of the normalization factors as described in this paper cannot account for all of the sample geometry changes. However, as demonstrated by the 131I behavior, it still provides a more representative correction compared with the methods derived for bare UO2 samples.
5.2. Release behavior of Xe and Kr
Based on the measurements of 133Xe and 85Kr release in short-duration tests at high heating rates (samples heated to 1512 K and 1630 K in HRE1 and HRE2) (Dickson et al., 2003), a large-burst release was not expected during the LF1 test. Nor was a significant release expected during the isothermal annealing at the test temperature, based on the burst release of 85Kr (Une and Kashibe, 1990) after a 28 MWd/kgU burnup fuel sample from a boiling water reactor (BWR) was annealed at 1673 K for 200 min. In contrast, the LF1 sample was at 1577 K for ~90 min. The measurements of the Xe and Kr in the LF1 test were masked by the 133I contamination in the delay coils.
For the release behavior of 133Xe and 85Kr during LF3, approximately 85% of the Xe and 68% of the Kr appeared by the time the sample had reached the test temperature (~2100 s). The remaining measured Xe and Kr was detected by ~5900 s, with no new release following the end of the isothermal annealing period. Without an oxygen source, the fission gas release from LF3 is anticipated to be similar to the release from bare UO2 under inert conditions. Also, being similar to test LF1, the test did not achieve burst release conditions. The appearance of the majority of the Xe and Kr before the test temperature was reached met this expectation.
A comparison of the oxidizing-environment test results to those of LF3 indicates that both the cumulative Xe and Kr Bq/gU are higher by an order of magnitude or more for all the oxidizing tests. These results are in line with the observations made in the HRE1 and HRE2 experiments, where the onset of significant Xe and Kr release under oxidizing conditions occurred at lower temperatures than in inert-environment tests (Dickson et al., 2003), leading to greater releases overall.
As indicated in Table 2 the 133Xe release activities for LF2 and LF4 are significantly higher than that of LF5 (67.2 MBq/gU, 69.3 MBq/gU, and 39.4 MBq/gU respectively). This difference in total 133Xe release is primarily due to differences in the trace-reirradiation of the fuel samples. Within the nose cone irradiation facility, 4 of the 5 fuel samples were in equivalent irradiation locations, while the 5th sample (used for LF5) was in a location of lower flux. However the overall release rates of Xe and Kr in the Pb-covered tests LF2 and LF4 appear to be lower than in the LF5 (bare UO2 air test) over the duration of the oxidizing period. The amount and thermodynamic potential of the oxygen reaching the UO2 were decreased by the presence of the oxidizing Pb. The LF2 (steam test) release rates were lower than in LF4 (air test), providing some evidence that the differences in behavior are caused by the thermodynamic potential of oxygen reaching the UO2. This is in line with previous measurements of volatile fission product release in oxidizing environments and a similar temperature range. LF5 Xe and Kr releases occur in a burst shortly after oxidation; whether additional diffusional release occurs in LF2 and LF4 (which would also explain the higher overall release) is unknown. Further post-test analysis of the samples is required to determine the state of oxidation of the fuel.
As noted in Section 3.2, a correction factor was applied to account for the sorption of Xe in the delay coil tubing. Ideally, the sample temperature would be substantially below the test temperature when the spectra used for the correction are collected, ensuring no new release of fission gas from the samples. The temperature profiles of the tests and the timing of the gas release counting in the delay coils indicate that this was not the case. During LF4 a facility power outage occurred as the sample was being withdrawn from the furnace, which prematurely ended the collection of delay coil spectra. More delay coil spectra should have been collected after the sample was withdrawn from the center of the furnace and the oxidizing environment was switched back to argon. This leads to greater uncertainty in the Xe measurement for the entire test. In addition, the late test observations raise the concern that not all of the 85Kr had reached the delay coil, which may have caused underestimation of the Kr release in the LF2 test.
5.3. Releases of non-noble-gas fission products
5.3.1. Inert conditions
The sample in the inert test LF1 comprised only UO2 fragments. The test results can be compared to those of two tests conducted during the Universal hot Cell Experiment #9 (UCE9) (Hunt et al., 1987) at 1639 K (UCE9 test 8) and 1673 K (UCE9 test 14) in argon. The UO2 samples used in these tests had achieved a burnup of 22.15 MWd/kgU and had a maximum linear power of 60.4 kW/m. The release data processing method in the UCE9 experiment was different from the methods used in the present work, and the tests can, therefore, be used only for qualitative comparison of 137Cs and 106Ru release behaviors (no other isotopes were reported in the UCE9 tests). Both UCE9 tests featured a very slow release rate of 137Cs; test 8 had no measurable Ru release, and test 14 had a potential low 106Ru release. In the LF1 test, these qualitative behaviors were replicated, with a low release of Cs and a questionable very low Ru release. In the LF3 test (Pb-covered sample, argon environment), neither Cs nor Ru release was detected.
Iglesias et al. (1995) found that the release of Cs bounded the behavior of I in oxidizing and reducing environments and that, based on the vapor pressures of Ba and Nb in non-oxidizing environments, Ba and Nb were expected to be less volatile than either Cs or I (less released than Cs). These findings were drawn from UO2 fragment tests at a higher temperature than the ~1580 K temperature of the tests reported here. The expectation is that releases of I, Ba, and Nb in LF1 and LF3 should be less than the Cs release. Taking into account the uncertainties in the 131I and 140Ba release measurements, tests LF1 and LF3 show this behavior.
5.3.2. Oxidizing conditions
The LF5 test conditions (bare UO2 fragments exposed to air) were comparable to the test conditions of three air-environment tests from HCE1: F01 (peripheral fragment, test temperature 1473 K), F02 (central fragment, test temperature 1473 K), and F03 (peripheral fragment, test temperature 1673 K). The apparatus and methods for HCE1 were similar to those for HCE2 (Cox et al., 1993, Liu et al., 1994). In these HCE1 tests, bare UO2 fragments irradiated to 18.2 MWd/kgU with a maximum linear power of 37 kW/m were rapidly heated to test temperature and then exposed to air. Qualitatively, the release behaviors in these tests and LF5 match for:
•
I (rapid release with onset of O exposure; complete release),
•
Cs (rapid release with onset of O slowing to a constant release rate),
•
Ru (rapid release with onset of O slowing to a constant release rate), and
•
Nb and Ba (no measurable release).
In terms of behavior, LF5 most closely matches the results of HCE1 F02 with the overall Ru release (~80% in LF5 versus ~87% in FO2) being greater than the Cs release (~70% in LF5 versus ~76% in F02). A direct quantitative comparison of release behaviors is not valid as the oxidation environment was maintained for a longer duration in the HCE1 tests.
A qualitative comparison of the bare UO2 sample results to the Pb-covered air-environment LF4 results demonstrates that the release behaviors are changed. The onset of rapid releases of Cs and Ru following exposure to air was delayed relative to the bare-sample tests. The overall release percentages of Cs (~39–44% in LF4), and Ru (~39% in LF4) were lower than in LF5 (~70% for Cs and ~80% for Ru). This behavior in Cs and Ru releases provides further evidence of the oxidation of the UO2 being delayed due to the presence of Pb.
With no significant 140Ba release having been observed in previous oxidizing-conditions tests near 1580 K (Liu et al., 1994), the significant Ba release in LF4 (10–18%) requires further discussion. Compounds of Pb, U, and O are synthesized at ~873 K in O2-rich environments (Popa, 2016, Sterns, 1967, Cremers et al., 1986, IJdo, 1993). In addition, BaPbO3 is a stable compound with a perovskite structure that can be synthesized in O2 environments with long slow heating and 12 h soaks at 823–1023 K (Cava et al., 1993). Chemical interactions with the Pb, U, Ba, and O may dissolve Ba that diffuses to the sample surface and cause it to be released. This is a supposition, with no evidence other than the measured release of 140Ba from this test. Further examination of the post-test sample may provide a more solid explanation for this release.
Whereas a bare UO2 fragment sample was not exposed to steam in the GBI7 experiment, the test conditions of the Pb-covered LF2 test closely resemble those of the steam-environment HCE1 tests F05 (peripheral fragment, test temperature 1573 K) and F06 (central fragment, test temperature 1573 K). The samples for F05 and F06 were from the same fuel as the air-environment HCE1 tests F01, F02, and F03. In the F05 and F06 tests:
•
131I was released rapidly and quantitatively with the onset of oxidizing environment.
•
Cs releases in F05 were similar to those of the air tests, but Cs was released at a roughly constant rate in F06.
•
Ru was released slowly but steadily over the duration of the steam exposure.
•
Nb was retained in F06, and in F05 the Nb release was similar to the Ru release.
•
Derived Ba release values were smaller than their uncertainties.
The differences in Cs release behaviors in F05 and F06 were attributed to the differences in the segregation of the fission products in the differently sized grains caused by the fuel’s radial temperature profile.
The release behavior in the LF2 test (Pb-covered sample, steam environment) was qualitatively different from those in F05 and F06. Both Cs and Ru were retained in the LF2 test. The release rate of 131I was greatly reduced (leading to a reduced overall release of ~50%). Nb and Ba were also both retained in the sample, which matches the behavior in other fragment tests.
The release rates of 131I from Pb-covered samples in oxidizing environments were lower than in analogous bare-UO2 fragment samples. The air-environment (LF4) release rate was reduced, specifically at ~4400 s into the test, and the steam-environment (LF2) release rate was lower throughout the entire test. Aside from the evidence pointing to the delay of complete oxidation of the fuel due to the presence of Pb, chemical reactions or chemical dissolution of 131I in the Pb may contribute to these lower release rates. For example, PbI2 is a stable compound (Jolkkonen, 2013, PubChem, 2020b Again, further examination of the post-test samples may yield evidence to test this hypothesis.)
5.4. Pb Sample Configuration
It should be noted that, during the Pb melting phase of LF2, LF3, and LF4, at ~800 K, the molten Pb will have a greater density than the UO2 in the sample. In addition to this, with the varying size of fragments of UO2 within the sample, the surface tension of the newly molten Pb has the potential to relocate smaller fragments. Both of these phenomena may cause the UO2 to be exposed to the test atmosphere rather than be immersed in Pb according to the test objectives. As the Pb-covered samples were loaded at room temperature prior to the temperature ramps, the direct observation of the sample status was not feasible. A direct observation of UO2 relocation could be made via posttest sectioning portions of the sample boats.
Evidence of the UO2 being immersed in the Pb can be found by comparing the initial count rates between the inert atmosphere tests LF1 and LF3 (LF1 bare UO2 and LF3 with Pb). The UO2 samples were trace irradiated in equivalent positions in the nose cone irradiation facility, and would be exposed to approximately the same neutron flux during the trace-reirradiation. This would lead to the assumption that the population of the short lived isotopes being observed would be similar in these equivalent samples. The initial count rate of the 661.6 keV decay from LF1 was 601.5 counts per second, the mass-scaled and decay-corrected measurement from LF3 was 340.5 counts per second (unscaled measurement of 400.75 counts per second, unscaled measurement of LF2 was 424.55 counts per second, and LF4 439.2 counts per second ). This large a difference in count rate cannot be attributed to measurement uncertainty. If the samples are assumed to have equal amounts of radionuclides, this difference can be attributed to attenuation of the 661 keV ɣ through a thickness ~0.53 cm of Pb. The estimated depth of a pool of 46.9 g Pb in one of the sample boats at 1580 K is 0.557 cm. This does not eliminate the possibility of small fragments of UO2 being exposed to the test environment, however it is some assurance that the majority of the Pb is between the UO2 and the ɣ detector.
Recalling Fig. 4, which displays the calculated normalization caused by the presence of Pb, it can be seen that the values of normalization plateau ~5500 s into the test. Using Eq. (5) and the 140La 1596 keV peak from the final spectra, the estimated change in effective Pb thickness is ~0.51 ± 0.02 cm. While a comparison of LF5 to LF4 initial count rates will not be valid due to the difference in the flux the samples were exposed to during trace-reirradiation, the sample geometries of LF3 and LF4 are similar enough to assume a similar thickness of Pb between the UO2 and detector. This change in effective Pb thickness strongly indicates that the UO2 in the sample may have been directly exposed to the air for about half of the oxidation period. Further examination of the post-test samples may yield evidence to test this hypothesis.
5.5. Future work
The filters downstream of the samples will be leached and the leaching solutions will be analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Further characterization of the chemical state(s) or compounds of the Pb from LF2 and LF4 would be beneficial in clarifying the mechanisms participating in the oxidizing-environment tests.
Future tests of the fission product release of Pb-cooled systems are not currently planned. Annealing tests in inert and oxidizing environments that are more characteristic of operational transients and design-basis accidents would be beneficial in providing an understanding of potential source terms.
<Section>6. Conclusions</Section>
Tests of fission product release under accident conditions were performed on five samples of UO2 fragments: two bare samples, and three samples that included molten Pb in the sample. Samples were annealed at test temperatures of ~1570–1580 K under inert or oxidizing conditions. The presence of Pb in the samples exposed to air significantly reduced release of 137Cs and 103Ru, as the onset of release was delayed in comparison to the bare sample. 140Ba release occurred in the Pb-covered sample exposed to air, in contrast to the behavior of uncovered UO2 fragments. For the Pb-covered sample exposed to steam, only 131I release was measured and was found to be reduced to half. The release rate of 131I was reduced in both Pb-covered tests under oxidizing conditions compared to tests with uncovered UO2 fuel fragments. None of the tests had significant releases of 95Nb.
