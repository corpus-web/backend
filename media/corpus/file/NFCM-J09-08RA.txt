Summary
In this work, kinetics of methane oxidation was studied over bimetallic Pt/Pd/Al2O3 monolith catalysts using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments. Different monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were prepared in monolithic structure. The 1 wt% bimetallic catalyst (0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd) showed the best activity in terms of CH4 oxidation. The experimental data were used to develop a CH4 oxidation kinetic model. Two rate equations were developed for methane oxidation over monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts. The activation energy of methane oxidation over Pt and Pd was 124.8 and 55.312 kJ/mol respectively. The 2 rate equations were used to develop a rate equation for Pt-Pd bimetallic catalysts. A multiplying factor was used to account for the interaction of the 2 active sites and to adjust the monometallic rate equations to the bimetallic catalysts. Depending on the composition of bimetallic catalyst, the multiplying factor was a function of various factors. For 1 wt% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd and 1 wt% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd, temperature was the only factor, which indicated the applicability of the reaction mechanisms over pure Pt and Pd. However, for 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd, temperature and partial pressures of O2 and CH4 were the effective factors, indicating a shift from the reaction mechanisms over monometallic Pt and Pd. The distinguished performance of the 1 wt% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd was explained, from the bimetallic kinetic model results, by a significant contribution of Pt to the overall catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts by minimizing inhibition and decay of Pd sites and/or by increasing the rate of PdO formation. Increasing the Pt percentage to 50% or more resulted in elimination of the role of Pd.

1 INTRODUCTION
Methane is the chief component of natural gas (NG).1 Methane is used as a source of energy in different applications like thermal power stations and automotive engines. Natural has been and can be used as an alternative energy source to gasoline or diesel for vehicles and power generation units.1-3 The products of (NG) combustion are COx, NOx, H2O, and unburned methane and other hydrocarbons. Methane is the second most important global house gas after CO2, but its global warming effect is 23 to 25 times the effect of CO2.3-5
Different mitigation strategies have been developed to reduce methane emissions. For automotive and natural gas turbine applications, the monolith-supported catalytic reactors showed promising results. Oxidation catalyst is the most common method used to mitigate CO and CH4.6 Standard 3-way catalysts (TWCs) have been employed efficiently for gasoline emission control; it showed poor activity for methane oxidation.7 Traditionally, Pd shows excellent methane oxidation activity.1, 8, 9 However, different studies have reported Pd-based catalyst instability or decay in activity.8, 10-12 Bimetallic Pd-Pt catalysts showed better activity and stability compared to monometallic Pd catalysts, which was observed with dry8, 9, 11, 12 and wet feeds.13 However, catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts may still decay, due to metal segregation resulting in separate Pt and Pd isolated sites.9 Temperature and oxygen partial pressure were found to be the key factors affecting catalyst stability and active sites of bimetallic catalysts.14
In terms of characterization, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and EXAFS were used to confirm the formation of a mixed Pt-Pd phase in Pt-Pd bimetallic system.9, 15 The mixed Pt-Pd phase was identified using PXRD as a bimetallic alloy in close contact with PdO; however, PdO was not present when the Pd/Pt ratio reached 1/1 or lower.16 In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used investigate the effects of adding Pt to Pd on the average size of catalyst particle.15
Furthermore, Narui et al11 reported that adding Pt improved the activity and prevented catalyst deactivation. For example, 0.5 wt% Pd/αAl2O3 showed an initial activity of 88%, but the conversion dropped over time, reaching 75% after 6 hours. A 0.5 Pd/0.1 Pt/αAl2O3 catalyst attained 98% conversion under the same conditions, and was stable over 6 hours of operation. The authors observed that Pd particles migrated and coalesced, which was not observed after adding Pt to the Pd/αAl2O3. The improved performance was attributed to the suppression of particle growth and migration. Persson et al17 found that adding Pt to Pd catalyst in a ratio of around 1:10 improved catalyst activity, yet a higher percentage of Pt was needed to increase catalyst stability.16 Based on a steady-state activity tests, they found that the most promising 2 mixtures of Pd/Pt were 2/1 and 1/1.17
In addition, adding Pt induced the simultaneous presence of metallic Pd and PdO, which are essential for the onset of methane oxidation.17, 18 Several studies have shown that the rate of methane oxidation was affected by Pd/PdO ratio.17-19 Furthermore, Lapisardi et al9 reported that the effects of Pt addition on the performance of the catalyst depend on water content of the feed. The authors showed that the addition of Pt had no effect when the feed was dry (no water added other than water produced during the reaction) unless the Pt percentage exceeded 45 wt% of the active phase. A higher Pt percentage showed a negative effect on catalyst activity. However, with feed containing water, better performance was observed with bimetallic catalysts.
In this study, methane oxidation using catalysts with different Pd/Pt ratios was evaluated experimentally, and a kinetic model was developed. Various CH4, O2, and H2O contents were used to evaluate the activity of the catalysts under different feed compositions. Different loadings of monometallic catalysts were tested. Based on the experimental study, kinetic rate equations for monometallic catalysts for monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts were developed. The monometallic rate equations were used to model the bimetallic catalysts. The bimetallic model can predict the behavior of the mixed Pt-Pd catalyst under different reaction conditions.
2 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
A cordierite honeycomb monolith loaded with alumina (1.6 g/in3, 97.64 kg/m3) with a cell density of 325 cell/in2 (cpsi) was provided by Johnson Matthey. Samples were cut to 2.14-cm diameter with a length of 6.3 cm. The area of each cell is equal to 0.0144 (0.12 × 0.12) cm2, which reduces radial variation in temperature. Pt and Pd were applied via coimpregnation using Pt and Pd precursors. The precursors were tetrammine platinum hydroxide and tetrammine palladium nitrate, purchased from Alfa Aesar. The active phase percentage was 1 wt% relative to alumina loading, equivalent to 976 g/m3 (27.64 g/ft3). The weight ratio of Pt/Pd in the active phase varied between 1/0 (referred to hereafter as 1% Pt), 0.9/0.1 (1% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd), 0.5/0.5 (1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd), 0.1/0.9 (1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd), and 1/0 (1% Pd). In addition, a highly loaded monometallic sample was prepared, with 3.61 wt% relative to alumina and are referred to as: 3.61% Pt and 3.61% Pd respectively.
The supported catalysts were calcined at 700°C for 2 hours. The calcined catalyst was hydrothermally aged at 650°C for 3 hours using 5% H2O, 10% O2, in a nitrogen balance. The catalyst was reduced using 1% H2 in N2 for 3 hours at 400°C, then the catalyst was cooled down under N2 to 80°C.
The testing reactor was a quartz tube reactor placed inside a horizontal Lindberg Minimite temperature controlled furnace. The tube reactor is 60 cm long and 2.54 cm internal diameter, connected with glass metal interface to the metallic tubes in the feeding system. Figure 1 shows the experimental process diagram. 3K-type thermocouples were used to measure temperature inside the monolithic catalyst located at radial centers of the catalyst; 1 mm upstream of the catalyst, in the center, and inside the outlet face of the catalyst. To avoid gas bypass, the catalyst was wrapped with 3 M matting insulation.

Methane and oxygen gases were supplied by Praxair, and N2 was generated using a nitrogen generator from OnSite. The gas flow rate was controlled by Bronkhorst mass flow controllers. Water flow rate was controlled using a Bronkhorst CEM vaporizer. A Multi-Gas 2030 FT-IR analyzer—MKS Instruments—was used to measure the outlet gas composition. The feed inlet total flow rate was 5 L/min, corresponding to space velocity of 13 500 hour−1 at STP. Different concentrations of CH4 were used, 2000, 1000, and 500 ppm, as well as different O2 concentrations, 10%, 5%, and 0.1%. Water concentrations were varied between 1 and 5 vol%. The reacting mixture concentrations were selected to simulate different expected conditions in the exhaust stream.
H2 chemisorption measurements were conducted using crushed monolith catalyst in a Hiden CatLab reactor. Seventy milligrams of catalyst calcined at 700°C for 3 hours was placed in a 4-mm ID tube reactor. The catalyst was reduced in 5 vol% H2 at 650°C for 30 minutes; then, the sample was cooled under helium to room temperature. H2 (1 vol%) in He was injected through the sample to measure the dispersion. The dispersion measurements of different catalysts are shown in Table 1.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The effects of Pt/Pd ratio on CH4 oxidation were tested using a feed mixture containing 2000 ppm CH4, 10% O2, 1% H2O, and a balance of N2. Results of CH4 conversion are shown in Figure 2. A similar trend was observed during the extinction step and with different concentrations of methane between 500 and 2000 ppm. As shown in Figure 2, the monometallic Pt sample was quite poor relative to the Pd sample. Overall, the catalytic activity declined in the following order: 1% 0.9 Pd-0.1 Pt > 1% Pd > 1% Pt > 1% 0.5 Pd-0.5 Pt > 1% 0.9 Pd-0.1 Pt. The results agree well with those reported by Castellazzi et al,20 who showed that a 0.1 ratio of Pt/Pd resulted in the best catalytic activity among the different ratios examined. A decrease in methane conversion at high temperatures (~600°C) for the monometallic Pd sample was noted, which was attributed to the decomposition of PdO, which is the active form of the metal, to metallic Pd and O2. O2 forms inactive layer that prevent further oxidation of Pd. The inactive layer of O2 acts as a poison thus inhibiting Pd oxidation.8, 18, 21

Increasing the monometallic Pd loading has significantly improved the catalyst activity, as shown in Figure 2. For both low 1 wt%, and 3.6 wt%, Pd loadings, the light off occurred at about the same temperature. A drop in methane conversion was observed with 1 wt% Pd catalyst around 600°C due to the adsorption of oxygen on Pd surface forming a layer that prevent further oxidation of Pd bulk and reduce the active sites in Pd bulk,8, 18, 21 However, the rate of conversion has shown sharp increase with 3.6 wt% Pd catalyst at around 300°C. No observable decrease in conversion was observed with 3.6 wt% Pd catalyst at high temperatures, due to either (1) the lower dispersion of Pd particles that resist oxide decomposition or (2) the high conversion rate observed with 3.6 wt% Pd decreasing Pd oxide decomposition. A lower dispersion of 3.6% Pd reduced the extent of oxygen inactive adsorption on Pd keeping methane conversion around the same level.8, 21, 22 Similar to monometallic Pd, 1 and 3.6 wt% Pt catalysts have shown similar performance at low temperature range. Pt (3.6 wt%) has showed sharp increase in methane conversion after 500°C.
The effect of water on catalyst performance was evaluated as shown in Figures 3 and 4. For 1 wt% Pd catalyst, a substantial reduction in activity was observed. For highly loaded 3.6 wt% Pd catalyst, a reduction in conversion has was observed and the light off temperature increased. In the presence of water, Pd may form inactive Pd (OH)2.8, 21 The activity of bimetallic catalysts has decreased dramatically. A stable performance of Pt is observed when water concentration is increased. For the monometallic Pt and the 0.5% Pt-0.5% Pd catalysts, increasing H2O concentration showed low destructive effect on activity. The turnover frequency (TOF) calculation has showed a positive effect of Pt addition. The drop in TOF reached the highest value with monometallic Pd catalyst as shown in Table 2 as a result of increasing water concentration. However, the positive effect of Pt addition to Pd in 0.1% Pt-0.9% Pd was demonstrated when water concentration has increased from 1.5% to 5%; TOF values were reduced only by 50% compared to 67% observed with monometallic Pd as shown in Table 2. The TOF for different catalyst are shown in Figure 5 using 10% O2, 1.5% H2O at 600°C. Overall, H2O had a negative effect on catalytic activity of Pd. Moreover, promoting Pd catalyst with Pt confines the inhibition effect on the catalytic activity. Higher loading of Pd and Pt mixtures reduced the inhibitive effect of water because of its low metal dispersion.

Data obtained from the 3 bimetallic samples with varying CH4 inlet amounts are shown in Figures 6–8-6–8. A similar trend was observed during the extinction step; Figure 6 shows the results of 500 ppm CH4 ignition in 1% H2O and 0.1% to 10% O2 using 1% 0.1 Pt to 0.9 Pd. A similar trend, to that shown in Figure 6, was observed with the 2 pure samples: 1% Pd and 3.61% Pd.

By comparing Figures 6-8, the effect of methane partial pressure was clearly demonstrated. As the Pt portion of the active phase increased, the effect of methane partial pressure diminished. Our calculations using Mears' criterion and using different approaches for predicting the controlling regime in monolithic catalysts have shown that neither the internal nor the external mass transfer played a major role in reaction rate.23-25 The Mears' coefficient was always less than 0.003 and the effectiveness factor ≈ 1. The influence of CH4/O2 ratio was noticeably demonstrated over 1% 0.1 Pt to 0.9 Pd. As CH4/O2 ratio increased, the extent of oxidation of Pd particles decreased leading to a reduction in the number of the active sites (PdO) available for the reaction. The competition between CH4 and O2 over active sites increased as the CH4/O2 ratio increased. This conclusion was supported by the results reported for methane oxidation over 1% 0.1 Pt to 0.9 Pd using 0.1% O2. As shown in Figure 6, the reported conversion for the latter case is the lowest, which indicate that increasing CH4/O2 ratio showed a negative effect on Pd catalysts activity. This conclusion was attributed to the fact that the actual active phase in Pd was PdO.15-21
As the Pt percentage of the precious metal content increased, the dependence on the CH4/O2 ratio was diminished. A significant change in catalyst activity was attributed to the decrease of O2 concentration to 0.1% which has improved CH4 conversion. With increasing Pt content, catalyst activity in terms of CH4 conversion has improved significantly as a result of decreasing O2 concentration from 10% to 0.1%, as shown in Figure 8. The conversion observed with 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd sample was always higher with the lower O2 content in the feed. This observation is attributed to the nature of the active sites of Pt and Pd, while metallic Pt was the active site in case of Pt particles, PdO was the active site for Pd particles. As Pt content in the active phase reaches 50%, the extent of PdO formation totally diminishes.16 Less O2 in the feed reduced the extent of Pt site oxidation and improved the overall catalyst activity and CH4 conversion.
4 MODEL—REACTION MECHANISMS
The experimental results discussed in the previous sections were used to develop a kinetic model for monometallic catalysts of Pt and Pd. The experimental data were used to fit the model parameters. Based on the 2 monometallic models, a kinetic model was developed to predict the Pt-Pd bimetallic catalyst performance. Throughout the modeling part, the 1% active phase catalyst (pure and mixed) was considered excluding the high loaded catalysts (3.61%). Two typical methane oxidation reaction mechanisms were found in the literature, distinguished by the role of oxygen in the mechanism. One has oxygen intermediates as reactants/products in every step, and H* abstraction was assisted by O*.26, 27 The other assumed that the reaction proceeds through methane decomposition until CH* is produced; then, CH* is oxidized to HCO*.28, 29 For each model, a rate-determining step (RDS) was used to develop a general model equation based on the surface coverage of the reaction intermediates.

4.3 Model assumptions
In this work, the monolith was described using a single channel model, and a uniform distribution of inlet gases. A 1D model was developed to study the physical processes and chemical reactions that occurred inside the monolithic channel. The following were assumed during model development:
Radial variations were neglected; only changes in the axial direction were considered.
The reaction takes place on the monolith walls.
The system is adiabatic.
Axial diffusion is negligible.
Axial heat transfer is a result of heat of reaction.

4.5 Reaction rate constant fitting
To estimate the reaction rate constants in Equations 1 to 4 and to find the best equation/combination of equations that can describe the experimental data, the model described by Equations 5 to 7 was used to represents the flow inside the tube reactor. The fitting tool box in MATLAB was used to fit the experimental data to the rate equations in 1 to 4. The experimental data used to fit the model parameters were the data collected for the 1% active phase catalysts.
After estimating the rate constants in Equations 1 to 4, the rate equations were used to predict the experimental results. The results calculated from Equations 1 and 3 represent the best fitting for pure 1% Pd and pure 1% Pt catalysts respectively. The reaction rate constants for Equations 1 and 3 were fitted to modified Arrhenius equations. The estimated reaction rate constants are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for Equations 1 and 3 respectively.

As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the predicted activation energy was close to the activation energy found in literature. The RSS values were 3.3815E−4 and 3.561E−4 for pure Pd and Pt respectively, indicating an overall limited discrepancy between experimental and estimated conversion. By plotting the measured and predicted results against temperature, a good fit was demonstrated between the measured and predicted value under different concentrations of H2O and O2 as shown in Figures 9 and 10 below.

Using rate Equations 1 and 3 after fitting the rate constants, a model for the bimetallic catalysts was developed. The bimetallic catalyst rate equations were fitted in different forms as a combination of Equations 1 and 3. Extended trials in fitting the bimetallic catalyst results using Equations 1 and 3 failed; the extended trials were extended to include Equations 2 and 4. An acceptable prediction of experimental results was found when a weighting factor was used to adjust the monometallic rate equations (1 and 3), kmPt and kmPd, as shown in Equations 8 and 9. The multiplying factors are dimensionless parameter fitted in Arrhenius's equation form. This factor accounts for the effect of the presence of the 2 active sites of Pt and Pd over the same surface. The overall rate is the sum of the reaction rates over Pt and Pd. The reaction mechanisms on Pt and Pd sites were different. Pt and Pd react in a different manner to the same oxygen and water concentrations. According to these findings, it can be concluded that Pt and Pt were behaving as active sites in a mixture the same way as in the monometallic catalyst. However, the 2 sites may interact together leading to change in the overall rate.9, 15 The 2 suggested factors can numerically improve the rate prediction and account for the effect of the interaction between Pt and Pd sites.

The predicted conversions using this bimetallic catalyst reaction rate equation showed good agreement with the experimental results obtained for both 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pt and 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd, as shown in Figures 11 and 12. The multiplying factor was a function of temperature and Pt/Pd fraction in the active phase. The dependency of multiplying factors on catalyst composition was attributed to varying interactions between active sites. As the composition of the catalyst changes, the nature and the number of catalytic active sites available for the reaction will be affected. Therefore, changes in nature and number of active sites should be considered in the multiplying factors.

A comparison between experimental results and model predictions for 1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd
The residual sum of squares (RSS) was 6.73E−4 and 4.8E−4 for 1% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd and 1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd respectively. kmPt and kmPd are illustrated below for both catalysts (Equations 11 to 14). The agreement signposts that the reaction mechanism over the bimetallic catalysts (1% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd and 1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd) was similar to the reaction mechanisms over Pt and Pd. This may indicate that the active sites' nature did not change as a result of combining Pt and Pd independent active sites over the same support. The numerical values of kmPt and kmPd refer to a dominant role of Pt in the mixed catalysts compared to a negligible role of Pd for both catalysts (1% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd and 1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd). The increasing role of Pt is attributed to the disappearance of PdO when Pt content in the active phase is ≥50%.

For 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd, the bimetallic reaction rate was harder to fit to the Pt and Pd monometallic rate equations (Equations 1 and 3). To well predict the results of 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd, O2 and CH4 partial pressures terms were added to the multiplying factor, which may indicate that the mechanism of reaction was quite dissimilar from what was used for Pt and Pd pure active sites. The distinct mechanism may indicate a certain change in the nature of the active sites from the pure metallic catalysts of Pt and Pd, either by alloying or by altering the electronic states of Pt and Pd. The multiplying factors of both Pt and Pd rate equations were altered around 700 K. The change in multiplying factor were attributed to changes that occurred in the nature of the active sites around 700 K as a result of Pt and Pd alloying/combination or change in oidation state. kmPt and kmPd are shown in Equations 15 to 18 for 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd. The residual sum of squares is 1.2E−3. The fitting results are shown in Figure 13 below.

The values of kmPt and kmPd in case of 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd were relatively close compared to the other 2 mixed catalyst especially for temperatures higher than 700 K, which show a significant role of Pt in catalyst activity. The role of Pt was either as an alloying element, which improved the resistance of Pd for water, or as adjacent active sites to Pd, which played a significant role in reaction by reducing the deactivation and competition over Pd sites. Pt is a preferred site for both of CH4 and H2O, leading to a reduction on competition over Pd sites, and preventing the formation of inactive Pd (OH)2. In addition, O2 will adsorb effectively over Pd to form the active form PdO.
5 CONCLUSIONS
Promoting Pd with Pt showed an improvement in catalytic activity only when Pt did not exceed 10% of the active phase. The 1 wt% bimetallic catalyst 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd showed a better activity and stability than pure Pt and Pd catalysts. In addition, the bimetallic catalyst showed a better activity with water than that of pure Pd catalyst. Higher loadings catalysts of Pt and Pd (3.6 wt%) showed better performance and better resistance to water inhibition. Higher loading of Pd and Pt mixtures reduced the inhibitive effect of water due to low metal dispersion.
The activation energy of methane oxidation over Pt and Pd was 124.8 and 55.312 kJ/mol respectively. A multiplying factor that accounts for the presence of 2 different active sites on the same support was used to adjust the monometallic rate equations to the bimetallic catalysts. The multiplying factor, used for 1% 0.9 Pt-0.1 Pd and 1% 0.5 Pt-0.5 Pd, was a function of temperature and Pt/Pd fraction in the active phase. However, for 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd, the multiplying factor was a function of temperature and partial pressures of O2 and CH4 indicating a shift from the reaction mechanisms assumed over pure Pt and Pd.
The monometallic and bimetallic kinetic models can predict well the experimental data, and the bimetallic model provides explanation for the role of Pt and Pd in the mixed catalyst. The distinguished performance of the 1% 0.1 Pt-0.9 Pd was explained in the model by a significant contribution of Pt in the overall catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts. Increasing Pt percentage in the active phase to 50% or more resulted in a complete withdrawal of any role of Pd active sites.
