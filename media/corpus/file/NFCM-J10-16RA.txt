Abstract
A well-defined magnetic metal organic frameworks (MOFs)/graphene oxide (Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO) consisting of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, HKUST-1 nanocrystal and GO was synthesized through a simple and environmentally friendly approach. Characterizations of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO adsorbing U(VI) with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy suggested that the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO possessed good stability. The introduction of GO enhanced the ability of particles to uptake U(VI) from aqueous solution. The effects of solution pH, contact time and temperature on U(VI) adsorption were systematically tested by intermittent experiments. The adsorption process can be better described by the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The results showed that the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO exhibited good adsorption capacity towards U(VI) at the initial solution pH value of 4.0 and T = 318 K. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the U(VI) removal mechanism. This work represents the application of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO as a novel adsorbent to extract U(VI) from contaminated water.

1. Introduction
In the last two decades, the problem of uranium pollution in water body has become the most serious problem in the world. It not only pollutes water body because of its toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic, but it can also cause indirect harm to human health. With the development of nuclear power industry, how to remedy U(VI)-contaminated radioactive water is a difficult problem. Recently, various methods have been studied to the removal of U(VI) contaminated water, for instance, chemical precipitation (Ma et al., 2019), adsorption (Chen et al., 2017; Lv et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2018), and solvent extraction (Beltrami et al., 2013). Among them, the application of adsorbents for U(VI) removal has been widely concerned since 1960s due to its simple operation, low cost and low emissions.
Graphene has been widely used in adsorption research due to its intriguing structural properties such as large specific surface area, and strong interactions between carbon and hydrogen atoms (Huang et al., 2019). Appropriate modification of graphene oxide (GO) not only reduces its self-polymerization but also enhances its dispersibility to achieve a higher adsorption capacity for contaminants (Kong et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016a, 2019; Zhu et al., 2019). Tang et al. (2016) has synthesized a novel composite material from GO and Fe–Mn, the composite exhibited good adsorption capacity for mercury in experiments. Fang et al. (2014) grafted amino groups onto graphene surface (GO-NH2), which showed a high adsorption capability and could remove more than 90% of cobalt within 5 min. In addition, the modification of graphene, chitosan and other composite materials improved the adsorption capacity towards U(VI) (Huang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018a).
The metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a research hotspot of chemical materials in the past decade. It is a new type of multifunctional porous material with periodic reticular skeleton structure formed by self-assembly using the coordination between organic ligands and metal ions. Therefore, a variety of combinations can change the properties of MOFs (Zhang et al., 2017a). To improve the stability of MOFs, the mixed components (MC-MOFs) of different bridging ligands and metal centers have been developed. MOFs are widely used in adsorption, separation, catalysis, drug storage and delivery (Wang et al., 2015a, b; Wang et al., 2016b) because they have the characteristics of hybrid, porous structure, large surface area and modifiability. Gao et al. (2019) reported that the porous nature of MOFs was utilized effectively for anti-tumor and antiretroviral drugs delivery, and reviewed the application of MOFs in the field of catalysis.
In these applications, adsorption and separation have gradually become a research hotspot in recent years due to the improvement of people's awareness of environmental protection. Cheng et al. (2019) classified the selective adsorption of gas on MOFs, they also analyzed the main relationship between adsorption properties and skeletal characteristics. It was confirmed that MOFs have excellent performance in separation and adsorption, and have high stability in aqueous solution (Liu et al., 2020). Many researchers have strong interest in the removal of contaminant on MOFs in aqueous solution (Canivet et al., 2014; Furukawa et al., 2014; Hasan et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2018b). For example, Haque et al. (2011) used iron terephthalate (MOF-235) to removal harmful dyes from wastewater and found the adsorption ability of MOF-235 was much better than that of activated carbon. However, some defects, such as the poor stability has been exposed and its applications also have been limited as MOFs were developed in recent research (Canivet et al., 2014; Furukawa et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2019). In the field of adsorption, it is regarded that the adsorption behavior of MOFs depends on the functional groups on the surface of adsorbent (Liu et al., 2015). Many experiments have proved that MOFs-based functional composites can greatly improve their capacities. For example, Deng et al. (2010) reported that MOFs could incorporate many different functionalities on linking groups in a way that mixed the linker to improve their selectivity. GO can be easily dispersed in aqueous solution because of their hydrophilic character (Park et al., 2009), and the combination of MOFs materials with GO can mitigate the instability of MOFs under humid conditions (Petit et al., 2012). Petit and Bandosz, 2009a, Petit and Bandosz, 2009b, Petit and Bandosz, 2012 developed MOFs/GO composites and the results showed that the composites not only improved stability but their adsorption capacity also has been developed. The MOFs/GO composites combine the excellent properties of carbonaceous graphene surface with high porosity and adjustability of MOFs (Jahan et al., 2012). Therefore, MOFs/GO composites are expected to be a potential efficient adsorbent for wastewater treatment in environmental pollution cleanup. Li et al. (2013) has synthesized HKUST-1/GO and utilized it to adsorb MB (methylene blue) from aqueous solution. The experimental result showed that GO greatly increased the surface area of composite materials, which made contribution improve the adsorption ability for MB. Because magnetic separation is obviously convenient, economical and efficient, magnetic MOFs have been widely developed and used in pollutants treatment (Lv et al., 2019b; Mahmoud et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017). Based on the inspiration of the above compound materials, we synthesized a magnetic sphere hybrid ternary composite Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO via hydrothermal method. In this study, the removal capacity of the novel composite towards U(VI) was studied by changing pH, time and temperature, and the mechanism was also explored.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
All reagents in the investigation were at least of analytical grade and used without further purifications. H2SO4 and KMnO4 were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai. Copper nitrate trihydrate, 1,3, 5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC, 98%) and polyethylene glycol were bought from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Graphite powder was obtained from Qingdao Graphite Co. Ltd., China. Stock solution (2.38 g/L) of U(VI) was prepared by dissolving UO2(NO3)2·6H2O (spectral purity, Sigma-Aldrich) into deionized water in N2 conditions.
2.2. Synthesis of GO
GO was produced from natural graphite powder according to the modified Hummers' method (Hummers and Offeman, 1958) with H2SO4 and KMnO4. Typically, pour graphite powder into concentrated H2SO4 and continuous vigorous agitating it in ice-bath conditions, then KMnO4 was slowly added approximately 6 h. The mixture was continually agitated for 24 h at room temperature. After that, 20 mL H2O2 (30 wt %) was added to remove the residual MnO4− ions after vigorous stirring for 1 h at 80 °C. The oxidation product was purified by poaching with a 10% HCl solution, washed with distilled water several times and dried under vacuum (65 °C and 24 h) for the following experiments.
2.3. Preparation of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO
Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized in accordance with the reported method (Deng et al., 2005) with some modifications. The synthesis of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO is presented in Scheme 1. Fe3O4@HKUST-1 composite was prepared by a hydrothermal method. In a typical preparing process: dissolved 0.6514 g of H3BTC in 18 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol to achieve a uniform solution, stirred the hybrid at 25 °C for 15 min and then mixing with 18 mL of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O aqueous solution. After the mixed solution was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h, 0.34 g Fe3O4 was added. The above mixed solution was dispersed by ultrasound to get uniform dispersion, and put the mixture into Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C, the autoclave was then cooled to ambient temperature after 12 h. The product was centrifuged (8000 rpm for 5 min) and washed for three times with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol. Finally, the obtained product was dried in vacuum oven at 130 °C for 12 h to obtain brown powder. 0.3 g GO powder was dispersed into well-dissolved H3BTC, and the subsequent steps are the same as the procedures of synthesis the Fe3O4@HKUST-1. And the novel adsorbent of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO was obtained.

2.4. Characterization
Shape characteristic of the composite was observed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Model SIRION TMP, PEI Company, America) and transmission electronic micrograph (TEM) (Hitachi, H7500). The FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra of the adsorbents were recorded within a range 400–4000 cm-1 by a FTIR spectrometer (American Nicolet Corp. Model 170-SX). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the electronic states. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (D/max-IIIC, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to verified the crystalline structure and composition. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, X-2, Thermo Fisher) was employed to detect the concentration of U(VI) after adsorption. The zeta potential of the material was obtained via a zeta potential analyzer (Malvern Instrument Co, UK) at room temperature. Thermal stability of Fe3O4@HKUST–1/GO was analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC 1/1100 SF). In addition, Raman spectroscopy was carried out with WITEC CRM200 Raman system.
2.5. Adsorption experiments
Fe3O4@HKUST–1/GO was used to remove U(VI) from contaminated water in the reciprocating shaker bath at 180 rpm. The adsorption process was investigated as a function of pH (adjusted by 0.1 M HNO3 and NaOH), reaction time, initial concentration and temperature. The adsorbate standard solution (119 mg/L) was obtained by dissolving suitable amount of stock solution (2.38 g/L) in the deionized water. The above standard solution was appropriately diluted to produced desired U(VI) concentration. In these experiments, 0.2 g of Fe3O4@HKUST–1/GO was dissolved in 200 mL deionized water to obtain an adsorbent solution with a concentration of 1.0 g/L. After each adsorption experiment, the solution was centrifuged by centrifugation. The residual concentration of adsorbate in the experimental solution after adsorption was tested by ICP-MS. The adsorption capacity qe (mg/g) and the removal rate (%) of U(VI) were calculated according to Eqs. (1), (2):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
Fig. 1A presents the XRD patterns of pure HKUST-1, GO and Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite. For pure GO, obviously, there is a strong diffraction peak at 10.4°, which is consistent with the previous report (Chen et al., 2016). Pure HKUST-1 has many diffraction peaks, especially in the 2-theta range of 5o-30°, the diffraction peaks of the sample at 2θ values of 9.56°, 11.56°, 13.2°, 17.3°, 20.01°, 29.35° corresponding to the (220), (222), (440), (511), (660), (751) planes, respectively, which are accordance with the reported literature (Wu et al., 2018) for the cubic phase of the HKUST-1. In the XRD of the ternary composite, not only the characteristic peaks of the two pure materials mentioned above, but also five new diffraction peaks can be observed. The five new characteristic peaks at 2θ = 30.19°, 35.56°, 43.17°, 57.12° and 62.75° index to (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440), which can be attributed to characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Chen et al., 2016). These results confirm that the ternary composite has been successfully synthesized.

FTIR spectrum of Fe3O4@HKUST–1/GO is described as indicated Fig. 1B, and the characteristic band at 580 cm−1 corresponding to Fe–O group indicates the existence of the Fe3O4 (Xie and Wan, 2018). Meanwhile, the peak at 629 cm-1 indicates bonding between Cu–O. As can be seen from Fig. 1B, the peaks at 1379, 1446, 1564, 1614 cm-1 are the absorption bonds of the composite material. According to the relevant references (Azhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016), the peaks at 1446 and 1614 cm-1 represent -O-C-O- groups, and the bands at 1379 and 1564 cm-1 correspond to Cdouble bondC stretching. Peaks in the range of 1379–1614 cm-1 can be ascribed to the bending vibration peak of the carboxyl groups in BTC, which is also the characteristic peak of HKUST-1. Moreover, the characteristic peaks at 834 and 3400 cm-1 can be used to determine the presence of GO in the composite, and the peak at 3400 cm-1 is associated with the hydroxyl vibration absorption of GO. For the novel composite, the characteristic FTIR absorption band related to Fe3O4, GO and HKUST-1 is clearly observed, which further reveals that three materials have been combined successfully. Fig. 1B represents the FTIR spectrum of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO after U(VI) adsorbed, the carbonyl stretching absorption peak of the adsorbent shifts from 1564 to 1534 cm-1 due to the coordination of U(VI) with –COOH functional group, and the stretching vibrations of U(VI) was observed at 930 cm-1 (Merroun et al., 2003; V. Dubolazov et al., 2004). The intensity of peak at 1446 cm−1 was strengthened, confirming that the –COOH group played an important part in the removal of U(VI) after adsorption (Pan et al., 2007). The results implied that U(VI) ions were successfully interacted with these functional groups.
In order to investigate the thermal stability and MOFs content of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite, thermal analysis was performed for the prepared materials. The TG curve of HKUST-1 and Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO were illustrated in Fig. 1C. The thermal stability of the prepared materials was examined with the temperature increasing from 25 to 800 °C. From Fig. 1C, the thermal stability of composite material is much better than that of pure HKUST-1 and the thermal decomposition stage of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO is basically the same as that of pure MOFs. For pure HKUST-1, the weight loss of 27.8% at the first stage from room temperature to 220 °C was observed due to the removal of absorbed water and the elimination of free carboxylic groups (Wu et al., 2018), and at this stage the weight loss of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO was only 9%. Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO mainly degraded in the temperature range from 220 to 480 °C, in this stage the weight loss reached about 27.1%, which can be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the tricarboxylate linkers and the collapse of the HKUST-1 framework (Xie and Wan, 2018). Subsequently, at the third stage from 480 to 550 °C, there was a slight weight loss which was probably attributed to thermal decomposition of iron oxide and break down the structure of HKUST-1 that led to the formation of CuO (Ashokkumar et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018). The residual amount of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO and HKUST-1 was 50.6% and 36.8%, respectively. The calculation results show that the content of HKUST-1 in Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO is as much as 78.2%.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the sample is shown in Fig. 1D. The composite shows typical IV-type isotherms with H3-hysteresis loops, revealing the presence of mesopore (Chen et al., 2016). According to the pore size distribution curve of the ternary hybrids (Fig. 1D), the pore distribution is obvious in 39 Å. On the basis of the nitrogen adsorption analysis, the Langmuir surface area of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO is 72.23 m2/g.
From Fig. 2A, the sample exhibits a similar spherical structure. The TEM image of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite is shown in Fig. 2B. The hybrid material is encapsulated homogeneously and compactly, which indicates that GO enhances the hydrophilicity (Li et al., 2014). The HRTEM of the adsorbent after adsorption (Fe3O4@HKUST–1/GO-U) is described in Fig. 2C. The Fe3O4 core is encapsulated with the MOFs shell of HKUST-1 (Fig. 2D), which suggests that the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite possesses good stability.

The XPS spectra of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO before and after adsorption are shown in Fig. 3A. The survey spectrum of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO after adsorption indicates that the sample is composed of C, N, O, Cu, Fe and U elements, which confirms U is successfully adsorbed by the composite (Zhao et al., 2017). Fig. 3B shows the U 4f spectra of the adsorbent can be assigned to two doublet peaks of U 4f5/2 (at ~393.4 eV) and U 4f7/2 (at ~382.2 eV). The double peaks of U 4f located at 382.8 and 393.7 eV correspond to the state of U(VI) (Chen et al., 2017). The peaks at 284.6, 285.5, 286.1 and 288.9 eV of C 1s spectra (Fig. 3C) correspond to C–C, C–N, C–O and Cdouble bondO, respectively (Chen et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2016). From Fig. 3D, the N 1s spectra in Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO before U(VI) adsorbed can be fitted to two peaks at 399.5 and 400.6 eV, which correspond to N–CO and C–N, respectively (Zhang et al., 2017b). After U(VI) adsorption, a significantly change of peak area and intensity in N 1s and C 1s spectra was observed, as confirmed by the emergence of N–“O” and N–H peaks at 404.8 and 403.2 eV in Fig. 3D, respectively (Xu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2015). The results showed that both nitrogenous functional groups and carbonaceous functional groups were involved in U(VI) adsorption (Wu et al., 2019). The photoelectron peaks for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 shifted from 935.2 and 955.0 eV to 933.9 and 953.9 eV, respectively, which could be observed obviously in Fig. 3F, indicating that the interaction between U(VI) and Cu took place at low binding energy (Liu et al., 2013a; Wei et al., 2018; Zhuo et al., 2017). The Cu 2p and N 1s peaks originated from HKUST-1, thus it can be inferred that the functional groups of HKUST-1 are involved in the adsorption process. The XPS spectra of Fe 2p before and after adsorption (Fig. 3E) show two main peaks at 711.3 and 725 eV, which are assigned to Fe 2p3/2 (Fe–OOH and Fe2O3) and Fe 2p1/2 (Fe–OOH), respectively (Chen et al., 2017). The result confirms the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Guo et al., 2015; Hua et al., 2018). Based on the XPS and FTIR analysis, the adsorption process is mainly ascribed to HKUST-1and GO in the removal of U(VI).

Fig. 4 displays the HRTEM images and element mapping of the sample after adsorption. The HRTEM-mapping (Fig. 4C–H) provides a clear understanding of the element distribution and the structure of the sample after adsorption. They are shown in different colors, for the purpose to identify their positions within the adsorbent. From the selected area, the Fe (Fig. 4C) and O mapping (Fig. 4D) illustrated that Fe3O4 was dense in the core. C, N, and Cu elements are also noticed homogeneously dispersed throughout Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO (Fig. 4E–G). Meanwhile the wider distribution of U (Fig. 4H) than those of other elements confirmed that the U(VI) was just attached to the surface of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO (Lv et al., 2019c). The mapping results agreed well with the XPS results, and further confirmed that HKUST-1 and GO played a significant role in the removal procedure.

3.2. Effect of pH
It is well known that metal ion adsorption behavior is obviously influenced by pH values of the system. Compared with pure GO (Fig. 5A), the Fe3O4@HKUST-1 composite exhibits the lower adsorption ability, while the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite shows the slightly higher removal ability. GO is an ideal nonporous adsorbent and sorption mainly occurs on its planar surface, at low pH, pure GO has a slightly higher adsorption performance than the Fe3O4@HKUST-1 composite. According to previous research (Chen et al., 2016), it was found that the Fe3O4 having almost no ability to adsorb U(VI). Thus, the ability to removal U(VI) on Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO mainly comes from GO and HKUST-1, a small amount of GO plays a role in improving the removal performance of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite. From Fig. 5A, the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO shows clearly higher removal efficiency than that of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1 in different pH ranges, indicating that GO has a contribution for U(VI) adsorption in the composite. The adsorption percentage of uranium reaches its maximum at pH 5.0, and then the removal rate starts to decrease gradually at pH > 7.0. The pH dependence of U(VI) adsorption can be related to the surface charge of the adsorbent and the species of U(VI) in solution. The zeta-potential value (Fig. 5B) indicates that the surface charge of adsorbent is negative charge at pH higher than 3.7. According to the U(VI) form distribution (Hua et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019), UO22+ is the primary state of U(VI) at pH 3–5, the more negative the surface charge of composite with increasing pH, which interacts with UO22+ through electrostatic attraction and thus enhances the removal rate of U(VI) (Fig. 5A). (UO2)3(OH)7- and UO2(CO3)22− are the main components in the pH scope of 6.0–10.0 (Zhao et al., 2019). At pH > 6.0, the adsorbent inhibits the removal of the negatively charged U(VI) forms attribute to electrostatic repulsion, and thereby reduces U(VI) adsorption at higher pH values.

3.3. Adsorption kinetics
From Fig. 5C, the adsorption capacity increases rapidly during the initial 45 min, and then the following 75 min is a slow step in which the adsorption process reaches equilibrium (Ce = 19.31 mg/L). In this experiment, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models are used to explain the adsorption kinetics. The linear form of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models can be described by following formulas, respectively (Luo et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2018c):
@(3)
@(4)
where qe and qt index the removal abilities (mg/g) at equilibrium and t time (min), respectively. k1 (min-1) and k2 (g/(mg·min)) are the rate constant of first and second order adsorption, respectively. The relevant kinetics parameters are presented in Table 1. The correlation coefficients (R2) of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was much higher than another one, which implied that the pseudo-second-order model can better depict the adsorption procedure of U(VI) on Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO.
Table 1. Kinetic parameters for the adsorption of U(VI) onto Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO.
Pseudo-first order model	Pseudo-second order model
qe(mg/g) (((mg/g)	k1 (min-1)	R2	qe (mg/g)	k2 (g/mg min)	R2
71.5	0.013	0.949	133.51	0.0004	0.99697
3.4. Adsorption isotherms and reusability
The adsorption of U(VI) increases with increasing temperature and concentration gradually (see Fig. 5D), which indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic nature. The equilibrium data were analyzed using the following Langmuir and Freundlich equations (Tan et al., 2015a, b):
@(5)
@(6)
where Ce (mg/L) is the concentrations of adsorbate solution at equilibrium; qe (mg/g) is the removal capacity; qm is the maximum removal capacity (mg/g) and b (L/mg) is the Langmuir model constant related to the affinity of the binding sites. k is Freundlich constant, and the n (L/mg) is related to the adsorption intensity. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes homogeneity of adsorption surface, with no interaction between adsorbed molecules (Fig. 6A). The Langmuir model assumes that the adsorption of U(VI) ions occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer adsorption. The Freundlich isotherm model assumes that the adsorption process takes place on heterogeneous surfaces. The relative parameters and results are calculated accordingly and presented in Table 2. One can see that U(VI) adsorption on Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO fitted much better the Langmuir isotherm model according to the correlative coefficients (R2), which clearly demonstrates that it is monolayer adsorption (Tan et al., 2015b).

In order to confirm the adsorption nature, thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG0 (kJ/mol), ΔH0 (kJ/mol) and ΔS0 (J/mol/K) were calculated according to the following equations (Jiang et al., 2015):

where R (8.314 J/(mol·K)) is the ideal gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature (K). lnK can be obtained by plotting lnKd versus Ce (Fig. 6C) and extrapolating Ce to zero. By plotting lnK versus 1/T, the intercept and slope equal to the value of ΔS0 and ΔH0, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters are also listed in Table 3. The values of ΔG0 were negative at different experimental temperatures, validating the process was thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous. A positive value of ΔH0 indicates that the adsorption of U(VI) is an endothermic process. A positive value of ΔS0 suggests an increase in the disorderness of the solid-solution system (Liu et al., 2013b; Zhao et al., 2019).

In the work, we also evaluated the reusability of Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO for U(VI) treatment. Undergoing three cycles, the adsorption rate of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO decreased from 84.3% to 75.9% (Fig. 7), and the slight decrease in adsorption rate revealed that Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO composite displayed excellent recyclability.

4. Conclusions
A novel ternary composite material, Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO, was successfully prepared by an easy and mild method. This composite maintained a stable structure before and after adsorption, and U(VI) adsorption was mainly dominated on the surface of HKUST-1 and GO. Adsorbent could be easily separated from solution, and GO enhanced the adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity was controlled by the initial pH, contact time, solution concentration and temperature. The experimental results showed that the adsorption data fitted well Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model expression. Thermodynamic parameters clearly suggested that the adsorption was an endothermic, feasible and spontaneous process. In summary, the Fe3O4@HKUST-1/GO could be a novel heavy metal ions adsorbent to remove U (VI) from wastewater.
