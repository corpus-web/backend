abstract
Sipunculus nudus Linnaeus polysaccharide (SNP) was puriﬁed from  S.  nudus  L.  via  NaOH  extrac-  tion, trichloroacetic acid deproteination, DEAE-cellulose 52 and Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. The monosaccharide analysis and molecular weight was detected with HPLC. FT-IR, 1H spectrum and 13C NMR spectrum were performed to detect the chemical characteristics. The antioxidant activity was assayed in vitro. The radiation protection effects were detected on mice. The results showed that SNP was com- posed of mannose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, arabinose and fucose, and the average molecular weight was 680 kDa. Above the concentration of 10 mg/mL, SNP showed powerful scavenging activity on hydroxyl radical. In the animals irradiated with a 7.5 Gy μ-rays, the 90 mg/kg and the 270 mg/kg SNP groups survived signiﬁcantly longer than the radiation control group. In the animals irradiated with a 4.0 Gy μ-rays, SNP showed signiﬁcant protection effect. The contents of DNA in bone marrow cells were signiﬁcantly increased by SNP treatment, and the micronucleus rates of 30 mg/kg and 270 mg/kg SNP groups were decrease signiﬁcantly compared to the radiation control group. These ﬁndings suggest that SNP possesses marked antioxidant and bone marrow damage protection capacity which play important roles in the prevention of radiation damage.

1.Introduction
Extracts isolated from plants, animals, and fungi have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as anti-tumor, antioxi- dant, and immune modulating agents. These extracts also exhibit liver protective, hypoglycemic, and platelet aggregation-inhibiting activities [1]. The active constituents responsible for each of these activities have been described qualitatively, with polysaccharides as the main contributor to pharmacological properties. Polysaccha- rides are widely distributed in plants, animals, and fungi and are used not only to store energy, but also as important factors in life activity.
Sipunculus nudus L. is an edible marine organism that has great potential for use as functional seafood due to its various bioac- tivities, such as anti-hypoxic, anti-fatigue, immune modulatory,antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities [2–5]. SNP was separated from the body wall of S. nudus. Some studies have investigated the biological activities of SNP, but little attention had been paid to its isolation and characterization. Many studies have demonstrated that exposure to radiation can induce various types of damage in animals, and in our previous work SNP showed radio-protective effects of on radiation injured animals [6,7]. Accordingly, this study reports the puriﬁcation and chemical characterization of polysac- charide from S. nudus and its radio-protective effects on 30-day survival rate, oxidative damage, DNA content and micronucleus rate of bone marrow cells in mice.
2.Materials and methods
2.1.Materials
Standard monosaccharides (rhamnose, fucose, galactose, glu- cose, mannose, arabinose, and galacturonic acid) were purchased from National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (China). DEAE cellulose-52 was purchased from Whatman Co., Ltd. (Maidstone, Kent, UK), and SephacrylTM S-300 was purchased from GE Health- care Ltd. (Chalfront St. Guiles, UK). Other reagents were of analytical grade. Six-week-old male BALB/c mice weighing 18–20 g were pur- chased from Sino-British SIPPR/BK Lab. Animal Co. Ltd (China). The mice were maintained under standard lighting (12:12 h light-dark cycle), temperature (23–27 ◦C), and humidity (50–60%) with freely available food and water. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Naval Medical Research Institute approved all procedures for animal care and treatment. S. nudus L. was purchased from Beihai (Guangxi, China) and identiﬁed by Professor Jia Fuxing from the Naval Medical Research Institute of PLA.
2.2.Isolation and puriﬁcation of SNP
Fresh S. nudus was homogenized and soaked in 6% NaOH for 4 h at 50 ◦C. After adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 10 mol/L HCl, the extract was centrifuged at 14,400 g for 30 min. The supernatant was deproteinized using trichloroacetic acid precipitation at pH 4.0. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,400 g for 30 min and the super- natant pH adjusted to 7.0 with 10 mol/L NaOH. Ethanol was added to the supernatant until the ﬁnal ethanol concentration was 75%, staying at 20 ◦C over night, and then centrifuged at 14,400 g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol three times.
10.0 g of the pellet was dissolved in 500 mL of 50 mmol/L Tris–Cl buffer (pH7.5) and applied to a DEAE cellulose-52 column (7.5 50 cm). The column was eluted with 50 mmol/L Tris–Cl buffer (pH7.5) containing 0–2 mol/L NaCl. After detecting the sugar con- tent of the fractions using the phenol–sulfuric acid method, two collections were obtained. The mean part is the second collection, which was applied to a SephacrylTM S-300 sieve chromatography column (5.0 40 cm) and eluted with distilled water at a ﬂow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The sugar-containing fractions were collected and termed SNP.
2.3.Determination of the molecular weight of SNP
The homogeneity and molecular weight of SNP was determined
using a Waters 515 high performance gel permeation chromatog- raphy (HPGPC) system equipped with a Tosoh Biosep G4000SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm) and Waters 2410 refractive index detec- tor. 20 µL of 0.5 mg/mL sample was injected, and 0.2 mol/L NaNO3 was used as mobile phase. Dextrans (average molecular weights are 196,300, 76,900, 43,200, 10,500, respectively) were used as  the molecular weight standards. The elution volumes were plot- ted against the logarithms of the average molecular weights of the standards. Empower software was used to calculate the average molecular weight [8].
2.4. Analysis of the monosaccharide composition of SNP
The monosaccharide composition of SNP was analyzed by HPLC. The sample was prepared according to the method described by Li [9]. Brieﬂy, 2.0 mL of 4 mol/L H2SO4 was added to hydrolyze 10 mg of SNP at 110 ◦C for 7 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at 2826 g for 5 min and the pH of the supernatant adjusted to 7.0 using 4 mol/L NaOH. 200 µL of the
0.5 mol/L PMP methanol solution and 300 µL of the 0.3 mol/L NaOH were added into 200 µL of the hydrolyzed SNP solution, and incu-bated at 70 ◦C for 70 min. After cooling to room temperature, 300 µL
of 0.3 mol/L HCl was added. The resulting solution was extracted three times with trichloromethane, and the aqueous layer was used for HPLC analysis. The analytical column was a reversed- phase C18 column (4.5 × 250 mm, 5 µm, ZORBAX SB-C18, USA). Mobile phase A was 50 mmol/L KH2PO4 containing 17% acetonitrile (pH5.9) and mobile phase B was 50 mmol/L KH2PO4 containing 40% acetonitrile  (pH5.9).  The  gradient  program  was  as  follows:  0–20 min, 100% A hold, 20–40 min, linear gradient to  70%  A,  40–60 min, linear gradient to 40% A.
2.5.FT-IR and NMR detection of SNP
FT-IR from 400 to 4000 cm−1 was performed to determine the functional groups present in SNP using a Nicolet Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (NEXUS470, NICONET, USA). SNP was mixed with dried potassium bromide powder, grinded thoroughly in the agate mortar and then pressed into a 1 mm pellet for FT-IR mea- surement.
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 27 ◦C on a
BrukerAV-500 spectrometer (Germany) operating at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR. The chemical shifts were expressed in ppm, and the delay time was 2 s. The freeze-dried gradients were dissolved in heavy water and examined.
2.6.Detection of free radicals scavenging activity of SNP in vitro
DPPH radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, and the reducing power of SNP were investigated in vitro.
2.6.1.DPPH radical scavenging activity
DPPH radical scavenging activity of SNP was detected with the method mentioned by Zhao [10]. 4 mL of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mg/mL was mixed with 1 mL 0.5 mmol/L DPPH methanol solution, respectively. The mixture was shaken vigorously and stayed in dark at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as positive con- trol with the concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/ml. The scavenging activity was calculated with the equation: Scavenging activity (%) = [1 − (Asample − Ablank)/Acontrol] × 100%. Where Asample is the absorbance of sample, Acontrol is the absorbance of control

The molecular weight of SNP detected by high-performance gel permeation chromatography with an Ultra hydrogel linear column (7.8 × 300 mm). 20 µL of 0.5 mg/mL sample was injected using ultrapure water as mobile phase. Dextrans(average molecular weights are 196,300, 76,900, 43,200, 10,500, respectively) were used as the molecular weight standards. The elution volumes were plotted against the logarithms of the average molecular weights of the standards. Empower software was used to calculate the average molecular weight.
(water instead of sample), and Ablank is the absorbance of the sample only (methanol instead of DPPH solution).
2.6.2.Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity
Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was measured according to the method of Khaskheli [11]. 1 mL of 1.5 mmol/L FeSO4, 0.7 mL of 6 mmol/L H2O2, 0.3 mL of 225 mmol/L sodium salicylate were added into 2 mL of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mg/mL SNP,
respectively. The mixtures were incubated at 37 ◦C for 1 h, and the absorbance of the hydroxylated salicylate complex was measured at 562 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The scaveng- ing activity was calculated with the following equation: Scavenging activity (%) = [1 − (Asample − Ablank)/Acontrol] × 100%. Where Asample was the absorbance of the SNP or ascorbic acid, Acontrol was the absorbance of black control (water instead of SNP), and Ablank was the absorbance of the reagent blank (water instead of H2O2).

The analytical column was a reversed-phase C18  column. Mobile phase A was 50 mM KH2PO4  containing 17% acetonitrile (pH5.9) and mobile phase B  was 50 mM KH2PO4 containing 40% acetonitrile (pH5.9). The gradient program was as follows: 0–20 min, 100% A hold, 20–40 min, linear gradient to 70% A, 40–60 min, linear gradient to 40% A.

2.6.3.Superoxide radical scavenging activity
For  this  detection,  1 mL  of  0.25,  0.5,  1.0,  2.0,  5.0,  10.0,
20.0 mg/mL SNP was mixed with 1.25 mL of 50 mmol/L Tris–Cl (PH 8.2), respectively. After incubating at 25 ◦C for 20 min, 0.5 mL
of 25 mmol/L pyrogallic acid was added  to  the  mixture,  and then 5 min later, 0.2 mL of 10 mol/L HCl was added, then the absorbance was measured at 320 nm, against a blank (distilled water instead of sample). Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The calculation equation  was  that  scavenging  activity  (%) = [1 − (Asample − Ablank)/Acontrol] × 100%. Where Asample was the absorbance of the sample, Acontrol was the absorbance of control (water instead of sample), and Ablank was the absorbance of the reagent blank (water instead of pyrogallic acid).
2.6.4.The reducing power of SNP
For this detection, 1 mL of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mg/mL SNP was mixed with 2.5 mL of 0.2 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 1.0 mL of 1.0% potassium ferricyanide (w/v). After incubating at 50 ◦C for 20 min, 2.5 mL of 10% TFA (w/v) was added to the mixture, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 1610 × g for 10 min. 0.5 mL of 1.0% FeCl3 and 2.5 mL distilled water were added into 2.5 mL of the supernatant, and then the absorbance was measured at 700 nm against a blank (deionized water instead of a sample). Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.

Fig. 6. 125 MHz 13 C NMR spectrum of SNP performed on a BrukerAV-500 spectrometer. the signals at 99.88, 101.78 and 102.05 ppm indicates that the glycosidic linkages of SNP were mainly þ-glycosidic bond. The 62.64 and 62.72 ppm signal should come from C-6 resonance of the monosaccharide residue.
2.7.Detection of the 30-day survival rate effect of SNP on mice irradiated with a lethal dose 137Cs μ-rays
A total of 60 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. They were normal control group, radiation control group, 300 mg/kg nilestriol group (positive control), 30 mg/kg SNP group, 90 mg/kg SNP group, and 270 mg/kg SNP group, and each group had 10 mice. Mice in the SNP groups were intragastric administered
0.2 mL of SNP aqueous solution daily for 7 consecutive days. Mice in the normal control group, radiation control group, and positive control group were intragastric administered distilled water at the same volume daily. The positive control group was administered nilestriol intragastrically 200 mg/kg at 24 h before irradiation, and 100 mg/kg at 4 h after irradiation. All mice, except those in the nor- mal control group, were irradiated by whole-body 137Cs μ-rays at a dose rate of 0.95 Gy/min, and the accumulated dose was 7.5 Gy. The 30-day survival rates were measured.
2.8.Detection of the protective effects of SNP on mice irradiated with a half-lethal dose 137Cs μ-rays
2.8.1.Animals and treatment
A total of 48 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 8 per group) as described above. The administration methods were the same as for the 30-day survival rates analysis. All mice, except those in the normal control group, were irradiated by 137Csμ-rays at a dose rate of 0.95 Gy/min, and the accumulated dose was 4.0 Gy. On the 14th day after irradiation, 0.5 mL of blood was collected from the mouse eye socket, and the mice were sac- riﬁced by cervical dislocation. The spleen, thymus and liver were

separated, and organ indices were determined using the following equation: Organ  index organ  weight 100 bodyweight
The procedures were performed in strict accordance with gen- erally accepted international rules and regulations.
2.8.2.Detection of MDA content, SOD activity, and GSH-PX activity
The MDA content, SOD and GSH-PX activities in serum were determined using kits from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Insti- tute, and according to the manufacturer’s instructions [12].

2.8.3.Detection of DNA content in bone marrow cells
The mice were sacriﬁced on the 14th day after irradiation and the femurs on both sides removed. The cavity of the left femur was washed with 10 mL 0.05 mol/L CaCl2 using a sterile syringe. The solution was placed in an icebox at 4 ◦C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1610 × g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, 8 mL of 0.2 mol/L HClO4 was added to the precipitant, mixed thoroughly, heated at 90 ◦C for 15 min, and then cooled by ﬂowing water. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 1610 g for 10 min. After being diluted three times, the light transmission of the liquid at 260 nm was measured in a UV spec- trophotometer.
2.8.4.Detection of micronucleus rate in bone marrow cells
8 mice from each group were sacriﬁced for bone marrow micronucleus test by ﬂow cytometry [13]. On the 14th day after irradiation, the bone marrow cells from the mouse right femur was ﬂushed out and re-suspended in 400 µL of neonatal calf serum. The immobilization solution containing 30 µg/mL SDS, 1% glutaral (v/v), 0.05 mol/L Sorensen (pH6.8) was added to ﬁx for 5 min, and the precipitation was collected after centrifugation at 402 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦C. The 4.36 mg/L acridine orange staining solution was added to the precipitation for 30 min away from light. After being re-suspended with PBS, the suspension was measured by ﬂow cytometer (BD Accuri 6 Flow cytometer, USA) and the frequency of micronuclei was calculated.

2.9.Statistical analysis
All of the data were given as mean standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed by paired T-test.
3.Results
3.1.Isolation and characterization of SNP
After isolation of crude polysaccharides from S. nudus. The puriﬁcation of SNP from the crude polysaccharides on DEAE- cellulose 52 ion exchange chromatography and SephacrylTM S-300 sieve chromatography are showed in Fig. 1. In HPGPC, SNP had    a symmetrical sharp peak, indicating a homogeneous polysac- charide, and the average molecular  mass  was  estimated  to  be 680 kDa (Fig. 2). HPLC indicated that SNP was composed of man- nose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, arabinose, and fucose in an approximate molar ratio of 1.2:0.9:7.5:88.8:0.8:0.9 (Fig. 3).
The FT-IR spectrum of SNP is shown in Fig. 4. The speciﬁc intense peaks at 3421 cm−1 and 2931 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of the O  H bond and C  H bond, respectively [14]. The
absorption of 1460 cm−1 indicates the presence of C H bonds. The weak absorption band at 1666 cm−1 belonged to carboxylic acid groups [15]. The absorptions at 1041 cm−1  and 1159 cm−1  corre-
sponded to the stretching vibrations of C  OH side groups and the  C O C glycosidic bond vibration, indicating a pyranose unit in SNP. The peak at 931 cm−1  suggests the presence of a glucose ring. A
characteristic absorption at 849 cm−1 was also observed, indicating
the a-conﬁguration of the sugar units [16].
In the 500-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of SNP (Fig. 5), the strong sig- nal at 5.32 ppm indicates an a-conﬁguration. Combining the results of the monosaccharide analysis and FT-IR, this signal was assigned to a-glucose. In 125 MHz 13C NMR spectrum of SNP (Fig. 6), the signals at 99.88, 101.78 and 102.05 ppm indicates that the glyco- sidic linkages of SNP were mainly þ-glycosidic bond. The 62.64 and
62.72 ppm signal should come from C-6 resonance of the monosac- charide residue.
3.2.Scavenging activity of SNP on free radicals in vitro
The results of DPPH radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radi- cal scavenging activity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, and the reducing power of SNP are showed in Fig. 7. SNP and ascorbic acid both showed signiﬁcant dose-dependent scavenging activities on hydroxyl radical generated through the Fenton reaction, and the scavenging effects was 99% at the concentration of 10 mg/mL SNP and 1 mg/mL ascorbic acid, respectively. It suggests that SNP has high performance on HO scavenge, but is not as powerful  as ascorbic acid. In the DPPH assay and the superoxide radical assay, SNP had not showed signiﬁcant scavenging activity on DPPH radical and superoxide radical, and the positive control ascorbic acid showed powerful scavenging activity on the two radicals. In the ferric-reducing assay, SNP did not showed ferric-reducing antioxidant activity, and the ascorbic acid show signiﬁcant ferric- reducing activity. These results suggested that SNP had a strong speciﬁc scavenging activity on HO , but had no effect on DPPH and O −2 scavenge and reducing power, and the scavenging activ- ity on hydroxyl radical maybe one of the cause of SNP on radiation protection.
3.3.Survival rate effect of SNP on the lethal dose irradiation mice
The damage caused by a lethal dose of whole body μ-rays was reﬂected directly by the survival rate 30 days after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8, the mice were dead several days after 7.5 Gy irra- diation. Most mice in the radiation control group died 11 to 21

Mice in the normal control group, radiation control group, and positive control group were administered distilled water at the same volume daily. The positive control group were administered intragastrically 200 mg/kg nilestriol at 24 h before irradiation, and 100 mg/kg nilestriol at 4 h after irradiation. All mice, except those in the normal control group, were irradiated by whole-body 137 Cs μ-rays at a dose rate of 0.95 Gy/min, and the accumulated dose was 7.5 Gy.Fig. 9. Effects of SNP on DNA content in bone marrow after 137 Cs-irradiation. The mice were sacriﬁced on the 14th day after irradiation. The left femur was washed with 10 mL 0.05 mol/L CaCl2. The solution was centrifuged at 1610 × g for 10 min. 8 mL of 0.2 mol/L HClO4 was added to the precipitant. The supernatant was collected
after centrifugation at 1610 g for 10 min A260 was measured in a UV spectropho- tometer. Values are presented as mean SD (n = 10). * P < 0.05 compared to normal control; **  P < 0.01 compared to normal control; #  P < 0.05 compared to irradiated control; ## P < 0.01 compared to irradiated control.
days after irradiation. The mice in the 90 mg/kg and 270 mg/kg SNP groups survived signiﬁcantly longer than those in the radiation con- trol group (P < 0.01), and their 30-day survival rates remained 20% on the 30th day.
3.4.Effect of SNP on the MDA content, SOD activity, and GSH-PX activity of the half lethal dose irradiation mice
To evaluate the anti-oxidation activity of SNP, the concentration of MDA, the activities of SOD and GSH-PX in serum were mea- sured. The results were showed in Table 1. Compared to the normal control group, the activities of SOD and GSH-PX of the irradiated group were decreased signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01), and the content of MDA was increased signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05). Compared to the radia- tion control group, the activities of SOD in the SNP treated groups were increased, and the activities of GSH-PX in the SNP groups were increased signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01), but the MDA content were decreased signiﬁcantly in the SNP groups (P < 0.05 in the 30 mg/kg SNP group, P < 0.01 in the 90 mg/kg and the 270 mg/kg SNP groups). The results suggest that SNP exhibited a signiﬁcant protecting effect against radiation induced oxidative damage.
3.5.Effect of SNP on the liver, spleen, and thymus indices of the half lethal dose irradiation mice
The liver index, spleen index, and thymus index reﬂect the func- tion and short-term effects of SNP on immune organs. The mean value of the liver index, the spleen index and the thymus index had no signiﬁcant difference among the SNP groups, the normal control group, and the irradiated group (P > 0.05) (Table 2). The results sug- gest that the irradiation had no signiﬁcant effect on the liver, spleen and thymus indices of mice on the 14th day after irradiation, and SNP has no signiﬁcant impact on the normal growth of mice and the development of immune organs.
3.6.Effect of SNP on the marrow cells DNA content of the half lethal dose irradiation mice
Previous studies have shown that irradiation decreases the DNA content in the bone marrow cells [17]. A sharp decrease in DNA con- tent was measured in the radiation control group compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05), whereas the DNA contents of the 90 mg/kg SNP group and the 270 mg/kg SNP group increased signif- icantly comparing to the radiation control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 9).The results suggest that SNP has protective effect on the bone marrow cell DNA damage induced by irradiation.
3.7.Effect of SNP on the marrow cell micronucleus rate of the half lethal dose irradiation mice
Bone marrow cells are very sensitive to irradiation, and the micronucleus rate of bone marrow cells was usually used to detect the damage of irradiation. In this study, the treatment with 4.0 Gy μ-rays signiﬁcantly increased the micronucleus rate of polychro- matic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of the mice (Table 3 and Fig. 10). The micronucleus rates of the 30 mg/kg SNP group and 270 mg/kg SNP group were decrease signiﬁcantly compared to the radiation control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). The results suggest that SNP has radiation protection effective on bone marrow cells.
4.Discussion
The exposure of mammals to ionizing radiation results in a com- plex set of symptoms. In general, radiation injury was classiﬁed into three syndromes: the hemopoietic syndrome, the gastrointestinal
Fig. 10. Protective effect of SNP on the micronuclei of bone marrow cells induced by 137 Cs-radiation. On the 14th day after irradiation, the bone marrow cells from the mouse right femur was ﬂushed out and re-suspended in 400 µL of neonatal calf serum. The immobilization solution was added to ﬁx for 5 min, and the precipitation was collected after centrifugation at 402 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦C. The staining solution was added to the precipitation for 30 min away from light. After being re-suspended with PBS, the suspension was measured by ﬂow cytometer and the frequency of micronuclei was calculated.
syndrome, and the central nervous syndrome. The hemopoietic syndrome occurs at lowest radiation dose (<10 Gy), and its man- ifests are the hemopoietic stem cell damage and the depletion of mature hemopoietic and immune cells, and ultimately results in infections and death. One of the mechanism of radiation damage is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O −2), hydroxyl radicals ( OH) and so on. These ROS will cause oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, lipids and small molecules substance and lead to many diseases [18]. Free radicals generated by irradiation attack the membrane and cause its peroxidation. SOD and GSH-PX are the major antiox- idant enzymes that block lipid peroxidation and protect the tissue against oxidative damage. MDA, the ﬁnal product of lipid peroxi- dation, is regarded as an index of cellular damage and cytotoxicity [13].
More and more papers show that polysaccharides have many activities, such as antioxidant [19], antitumor [20], antiradiation
[21] and immunomodulatory [22]. In many oriental countries, polysaccharide preparations such as lentinan and krestin have been recommended to improve the health [23,24]. S. nudus  is  widely distributed in sub-tidal zones and sea-beds of the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and especially in the Beibu Gulf of China. The S. nudus has long been used in traditional Chi- nese medicine to treat debilitating diseases caused by various pathogens, diabetes, tuberculosis, and carbuncles [25]. The previ- ous studies show that S. nudus preparations have several biological activities, such as anti-inﬂammatory activity as well as peripheral and  central  analgesic  properties  [26],  stimulating immunological
activity and anti-fatigue effect [5,6]. A water-soluble polysaccha- ride was extracted and fractioned from the body wall of S. nudus
L. by DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange and Sepharose CL-6B col- umn chromatography. It is a homogeneous polysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 350 kD and the monosaccharide com- position is rhamnose (28%), fucose (16%) and galactose (56%). It has the activity of up-regulating the expression of IL-6 and TNF-    a, and also induced the expression of iNOS and COX-2 [27]. It was demonstrated that the polysaccharide had signiﬁcant anti-hypoxic activity on normobarie hypoxia, chemical intoxicant hypoxia and acute cerebral ischemia hypoxia models in mice, and also enhanced the number of RBC and the concentration of hemoglobin [2]. Our previous data showed that SNP was effective on the recovery of hematopoietic damage induced by μ-radiation. Oral administration of SNP signiﬁcantly improved blood picture, hematopoietic activity, decrease in nitric oxide levels, and increase in activity of superoxide dismutase [28]. In our previous study it was also showed that the combined administration of SNP, WR-2721, rhIL-11 and rhG-CSF should increase the therapy efﬁcacy for acute radiation sickness, and protect immunity, hematopoiesis and the reproductive organs of irradiated-damaged mice, and improve oxidation resistance in the body [29].
The present study demonstrated that SNP composed of man- nose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, arabinose, and fucose in an approximate molar ratio of 1.2:0.9:7.5:88.8:0.8:0.9. The aver- age molecular weight was 680 kDa. It was demonstrated that SNP is difference with other reported polysaccharides from S. nudus L. The administration of SNP not only prolonged the lifespan of mice,
but also signiﬁcantly increased the activities of SOD and GSH-PX and decreased the MDA content, and SNP showed high perfor- mance on hydroxyl radical scavenge in vitro. Simultaneously, SNP increased the DNA content and decreased the micronucleus rate    of bone marrow cells in irradiated mice. These ﬁndings suggest  that SNP possesses a marked antioxidant capacity and facilitated hematopoietic activity, which play important roles in the pre- vention of radiation damage. SNP should be explored as a good hematopoiesis agent with antioxidant activity and may be applied to the anti-radiation hematopoiesis therapy. However, further investigation is needed to identify the underlying mechanism in terms of the antioxidant and hematopoietic activities.
