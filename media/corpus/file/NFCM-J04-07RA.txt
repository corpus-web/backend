Abstract
(ThxCe1-x)O2 microspheres (x = 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95) prepared by sol-gel microsphere technique were compacted to pellets. The sintering kinetics, diffusion mechanism, and activation energy of the (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets were investigated by dilatometry for 1100°C, 1200°C, and 1300°C. The rate controlling sintering method, one of the most sensitive methods, was chosen to investigate the sintering kinetics. The pellets were heated with a rate of 10°C/min and were held for 10 h at the above mentioned temperatures under isothermal conditions.
The activation energies for the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2, (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2, and (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets were calculated as 305, 315, and 419 kJ·mol−1, respectively. In the experiments, green densities of the mixed-oxide pellets were determined as 45% to 47% of the theoretical density for all of the studied ratios. Sintering densities reached up to 94% of theoretical density after sintering at 1300°C. Scanning electron microscopy images of the pellets were taken.

I. INTRODUCTION
There has been interest in utilizing thorium as a nuclear fuel since it is more abundant in the earth than uranium. All of the mined thorium is potentially usable in a reactor compared with natural uranium.
The thorium fuel cycle and thoria-based nuclear fuel types are candidates for the future of nuclear fuels. Thorium is a fertile material, so thorium-based fuels require the addition of fissile materials such as uranium or plutonium. Thorium can be mixed with radioactive waste from current uranium-fueled reactors to minimize nuclear waste. In recent years, thorium-plutonium mixed-oxide fuels have attracted attention because of their plutonium consumption potential with respect to uranium-plutonium mixed-oxide fuels due to the lack of uranium.
Uranium-free fuels are a new concept in which the uranium is replaced by elements not producing actinides under neutron irradiation. Moreover, thorium dioxide offers better thermophysical properties and chemical stability as compared to UO2, which ensures better in-pile performance and a more stable waste form.1 At the same time, thoria-based plutonium fuels and inert matrix fuels are appropriate to direct disposal in repositories.2
Even though thorium has been considered since the beginning of nuclear power development to be the nuclear fuel to follow uranium, the use of thorium-based fuel cycles has been studied on a much smaller scale as compared to uranium or uranium/plutonium cycles.3 Especially, studies on sintering kinetics of thorium-based mixed-oxide fuels are not frequent.
The mechanism of material movement in the sintering is not only important in determining the properties of the end product, but has also fascinated powder technologists ever since they have started contending with the science of sintering. Therefore, it is very important to determine the sintering kinetic parameters.
Various methods have been used to study the determination of sintering mechanism. Among these, dilatometric studies of powder compacts have been particularly useful because they allow one to contiguously follow dimensional variation in the same sample.
Sintering is a very complicated process of microstructure evolution. This evolution is a thermally activated process with the development of bonds among particles via solid-state diffusion. Since sintered materials are not melted, all movements are realized via diffusion processes.
The sintering of pure thorium oxide has been reported by several workers. Curtis and Johnson reported a maximum density of 80% of theoretical density (TD) after 2 h of sintering at 1800°C and noted that different atmospheres, i.e., air, helium, and hydrogen, do not affect densification.4 The origin of the ThO2 powder and calcination temperatures have been reported to have a marked influence on the crystallite characteristics of the powder and the sintering phenomenon. Pure ThO2 gel of particle size 70 to 140Å sintered very rapidly at considerably lower temperatures and 98.2% of TD was reported for sintering at 1000°C for 200 min.5
In this study, for the investigation of sintering kinetics of thorium-cerium mixed oxide, cerium was used to simulate plutonium. Plutonium, which is dangerous to work with because of its high radioactivity, involves specific precautions and necessitates complex equipment. On the other hand, most countries are deprived of plutonium.6,7 Cerium, a lanthanide series metal, is a common chemical surrogate for plutonium. Cerium has similar physical and chemical properties to plutonium and is a nonradioactive substitute for plutonium for the maintained studies on (Th,Pu)O2 fuel production in many laboratories around the world.8,9 The thermodynamic and crystallographic properties of cerium dioxide are similar to those of plutonium dioxide. It is well known that ThO2 and CeO2 also have the same crystallographic structure (CaF2 type, cubic) and mixed in any ratio, they form solid solutions.7,10
In the present study, a rate-controlled sintering method was used for the investigation of sintering kinetics and activation energy of (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets. In this method the green pellet is heated at a constant heating rate up to a target temperature by a dilatometer. When the temperature reaches the target temperature, shrinkage takes place under isothermal conditions. The experimental shrinkage curve, obtained by the dilatometer, is generally in the form of Eq. (1) (Ref. 11):
ΔL/L0=y=[K(T)t]n,
(1)
where
L0 =
initial length of the green pellet at the starting stage of sintering
K(T)  =
Arrhenius constant
t =
time
n =
constant whose value depends on the sintering mechanism.
If only volume diffusion is operative, then the shrinkage rate is given by Eq. (2):
dy/dt=n(5.34γΩDv/kTa3)nt(n−1) (n=0.49).(2)
Similarly, for grain boundary diffusion alone12
dy/dt=n(2.14γΩbDb/kTa4)nt(n−1) (n=0.33),(3)
where
γ =
surface tension
Ω =
vacancy volume
Dv, Db =
diffusion coefficients for volume and grain boundary diffusions, respectively
T =
temperature
a =
particle radius
b =
thickness of grain boundary
k =
Boltzmann constant.
The slope of the plot of log dy/dt versus log t will be (n-1) from which the sintering exponent can be evaluated. From the value of the intercepts, the diffusion coefficient could be evaluated. The variation of D with temperature is defined as
D=D0e(−Q/RT),
(4)
where
D0 =
pre-exponential factor
Q =
activation energy
R =
molar ideal gas constant.
The slope of the plot of log D and log (1/T) gives the −Q/R, where R is a constant of value 8.31441 J K−1 mol−1 and Q is determined from the slope of the plot in Eq. (4).
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Spheres of (ThxCe1-x)O2 (x = 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95) were prepared via the sol-gel process. Sols of (ThxCe1-x)O2 were prepared from nitrate solutions of thorium and cerium by adding ammonium hydroxide under pH control with heating. The total concentration of (Th + Ce) was designed to be 1.6 mol L−1 before neutralization and to become 1 mol L−1 finally. The sols were converted to gel microspheres in a gelation column containing two phases. The upper phase was water-immiscible hexone (methyl isobutyl ketone) to provide prehardening, and the lower phase, where the spheres are gelled, was 8M ammonium hydroxide. The spheres were aged in 8M NH4OH solution during 48 h and dried in an oven at 80°C. The dimensions of the spheres were determined from images obtained through optical microscopy and videos using the image analysis instruments Optamax V and Vids III. The diameter range of the spheres was between 300 and 500 µm. Detailed procedures and sol-gel system design were reported previously.7 The spheres were compacted as dried under 520 MPa pressure using a 6-mm-inner-diameter carbide single-acting die. A 0.2% suspension of stearic acid in ethyl alcohol was used for the lubrication of the mold. Neither the binder nor lubricant were used prior to pressing the pellets. The sintering of the pellets was performed by a NETZSCH DIL 402 C dilatometer under an air atmosphere. Three different temperatures, 1100°C, 1200°C, and 1300°C, were selected to investigate the sintering kinetics and quantity of the activation energy of the (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets. We provided a new green pellet for each sintering temperature. Pellets were heated with a 10°C/min heating rate up to the isothermal temperature step, then held at temperature for 10 h. Alumina was used as a reference material.
The microstructures of the pellets were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with the scattered electron image technique. The SEM images of the pellets were taken with scanning electron microscope model JEOL JSM-6390LV. All images were obtained from the unpolished as-received areas.
The green density of the pellets has been calculated by geometric method and the sintered density by immersion in m-Xylene.

The sintering kinetics and activation energy of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 pellets were investigated at three isothermal steps: 1100°C, 1200°C, and 1300°C. Figure 1 shows dL/L0 versus temperature and time. Approximately 23% shrinkage was observed with 700 min sintering time.

The sintering exponent n can be evaluated from these values, which vary from 0.41 at 1100°C to 0.47 at 1300°C. The sintering exponent values show that volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for sintering of the (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets at each temperature.

III.C. Sintering of (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 Pellets
The sintering kinetics and activation energy of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets was investigated under three isothermal steps: 1100°C, 1200°C, and 1300°C. Figure 9 shows dL/L0 versus temperature and time. Approximately 25% shrinkage was observed at 1300°C with 560 min sintering time. The shrinkage observed at 1200°C with 700 min sintering time and at 1100°C with 220 min sintering time were approximately 23% for each case.

Figure 10 shows log Y versus log t plots of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets at each isothermal step. The slope of the plots gives (n-1) value. The sintering exponent can be evaluated from these values, which vary from 0.38 at 1100°C to 0.61 at 1300°C. The sintering exponent values show that at 1100°C, grain boundary diffusion is the prevalent mechanism. But, from the next step, volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for sintering of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets.

While 23% relative shrinkage was observed at 1100°C and 1200°C, relative shrinkage reached 24.6% at 1300°C. The shrinkage rate was significantly higher during the first 100 min. Following this time, shrinkage was slow and at the end of the 300-min holding time, the shrinkage rate was close to zero.

The apparent activation energy is calculated from the Arrhenius plot of ln D versus 1/T shown in Fig. 12. The slope of the plot gives –Q/R, and Q can be evaluated from this value. The activation energy was found to be 419 kJ∙mol−1for the sintering of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets.

Curtis and Johnson investigated the sintering of thorium at different atmospheres, i.e., air, H2, and He. They found that the sintering atmosphere had no significant effect on densification,4 so an air atmosphere was selected for the sintering studies.
Previously reported Q values of ThO2 show a variation from 92 to 469 kJ∙mol−1. Laha and Das5 have reported 388 kJ∙mol−1 for the activation energy of ThO2. On the other hands Aybers13,14 has reported 293 kJ∙mol−1 for the activation energy of ThO2. This very wide variation can be caused by the differences in particle properties, i.e., particle size, homogeneity, chemical processes used in the synthesis of powders, or the measurement techniques. El Sayed and Sorensen15 have reported 499 kJ∙mol−1 for the Q value of CeO2. The activation energies for the sintering of the (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets from the present work is in agreement with the reported Q values. Barrier et al. reported that the addition of the cerium up to 20 mol % to the (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets enhanced the sinterability of thorium.16 Yidiz et al. investigated the effect of cerium concentration on the sintering of (ThxCe1-x)O2 powders.17 They showed that cerium concentration up to 25 mol % had a positive influence on the sinterability of (ThxCe1-x)O2 powders. But after this point, the increase in the amount of ceria was not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in the specific surface area, causing the density to decrease. In this study we found similar results that up to 25 mol % cerium concentration had a positive effect on the sinterability of thorium. While the activation energy of (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 was 419 kJ∙mol−1, the activation energy of (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 was 315 kJ∙mol−1. So from 5 up to 25 mol % cerium concentration, the activation energy value decreased 104 kJ∙mol−1. On the other hand, from 25 up to 50 mol % cerium concentration, the activation energy value decreased only 10 kJ∙mol−1. In the present study, the n values, diffusion coefficients, and activation energies of (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets depending on temperature and cerium content are given in Table I.

Figure 14a shows the scanning electron micrographs at two different magnitudes of a (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellet sintered at 1300°C. The pellet appears homogenous after the 600-min holding time. Interconnected pores are clearly observed. These pores are connected to the pores at the surface of the pellet. From Fig. 14b, it can be clearly seen that the pores are located at grain boundaries. Also, neck formation, which leads to pore formation, can be seen. Open and closed pores and grain boundaries can be seen clearly.

V. DISCUSSION
When particles are smaller in size and interconnected porosities are present, this is the ideal condition for grain boundary diffusion to take place as neck growth takes place faster. After the necks have grown enough and big particles are produced by coalescence as the temperature increases, volume diffusion mechanisms control the sintering process.5 Sintering exponent values show that the volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for the sintering of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 pellets at each temperature. In the sintering of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 pellets, grain boundary diffusion took place below 1100°C.
Sintering exponent values show that volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for the sintering of the (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets at each temperature. In the sintering of the (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets, grain boundary diffusion took place below 1100°C.
Sintering exponent values show that at 1100°C, grain boundary diffusion is the prevalent mechanism. But from the next step, volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for sintering of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets.
Activation energy values also support these hypotheses. According to low activation energy values, sintering of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 and (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets should start at lower temperatures. Due to the relatively higher activation energy, sintering of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets starts at higher temperatures.
Scanning electron microscopy images show that, while grain boundaries are distinct for the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 and (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets, in case of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets, the grain boundaries are less distinctive. The differences in grain boundaries can be attributed to the activation energy changes. As mentioned above, the activation energy of mixed oxides increases with decreasing cerium content. In this study, microstructural investigations showed that the sintering steps are not completed because of the relatively low sintering temperatures. The pore and grain formation began, but was not completed, as expected. Similar results were obtained in similar studies.18–20
Green densities and sintered densities of the pellets increase with Ce content. The (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 pellet has a higher sintered density, which is 93.4% TD, due to the lowest activation energy.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the first-stage sintering kinetics, diffusion mechanism, and activation energy of (ThxCe1-x)O2 pellets (x = 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95) prepared via sol-gel microsphere palletization (SGMP) technique were investigated by dilatometry for 1100°C, 1200°C, and 1300°C. The rate controlling sintering method was used to investigate the sintering kinetics.
The activation energy for the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2, (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2, and (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets were calculated as 305,, 315, and 419 kJ∙mol−1, respectively.
Cerium concentration up to 25 mol % had a positive influence on the sinterability of the (ThxCe1-x)O2 powders. After this point, however, cerium content had a minimal effect on the sinterability.
Volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism for sintering of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 and (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets at each temperature. In the sintering of the (Th0.50Ce0.50)O2 and (Th0.75Ce0.25)O2 pellets, grain boundary diffusion took place below 1100°C. In the sintering of the (Th0.95Ce0.05)O2 pellets at 1100°C, grain boundary diffusion is the prevalent mechanism, but volume diffusion is the prevalent mechanism from the next step.
As is well known, the grain and pore structures depend on the components, production methods, grain size, surface conditions of powders and materials, sintering temperature, sintering time, and sintering atmosphere. That means that all thermodynamic conditions influence the grain and pore structures.
As the results of the first-stage sintering kinetics and thermal investigations on the mixed pellets obtained via SGMP show, it is easily possible to prepare homogenous pellets attaining relatively high TDs (~94% TD) even for relatively low temperatures (1300°C). The higher TDs (>95% TD) needed to satisfy the needs of mixed-oxide fuels necessitate undoubtedly higher sintering temperatures, since it is well known that thoria-based nuclear fuel sintering temperatures are considerably high (>1750°C). Some additives and the sintering atmosphere also can change the sintering temperatures. The mixed-oxide pellets prepared via SGMP deserve further sintering studies for the investigation of the high-temperature sintering mechanism.
