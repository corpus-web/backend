ABSTRACT
222Rn exists in nature in the form of a rare radioactive gas. In terms of environmental radiation, issues regarding 222Rn have persisted because of its radiological hazardousness. Ulju County is one of the regions of Ulsan metropolitan city, with a population of 227,699. Ulju County has the highest density of industrial complexes in Korea. In this study, 222Rn radioactivity concentration was measured and analyzed in 57 schools in Ulju County using 114 passive LR-115 type detectors to secure radiological safety and conﬁrm basic information for reduction of resident exposure to 222Rn. The effective dose of
222Rn was assessed to ﬁnd the actual risk of the concentration surveyed in schools to human beings. The
dose depended on four factors: subjects, 222Rn concentration, dose coefﬁcient, and time. The individuals subjected to dose estimation were classiﬁed into three types: students, teachers, and ofﬁce workers. The subjects had different dwelling locations and times. The ﬁndings demonstrate that the radiological hazard to students and workers at schools in Ulju County owing to 222Rn is negligible in terms of 222Rn activity recommendation level.

1.Introduction
The radioactive nuclide 222Rn exists in nature as a colorless, odorless, and tasteless noble gas resulting from the uranium series decay chain. 222Rn forms monatomic gas with 9.73 kg/m3 density, which is approximately eight times standard atmospheric density.
222Rn has a half-life of 3.8 days and decays to the stable nuclide
206Pb after four alpha and four beta decays through 218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi,  and  others.  It  can  cause  lung  cancer  (through   inhalation)
[1e5] and stomach cancer (through ingestion) [6,7]. The environ- mental radiation caused by 222Rn is considered one of the most important issues in this research ﬁeld because of its known dan- gers. Another radioisotope, 220Rn, is one of the nuclides in the thorium series decay chain. Owing to the shorter half-life of this nuclide (55s), it is of less interest.
222Rn is affected by many factors, such as geogenic character-
istics, ventilation, building materials, and geometrical structure (e.g., cracks at wall and window positions) [8e12], and exposure rate to humans varies according to human activity [13]. Therefore, it is important to set reference buildings to survey regional differ- ences, and schools are a suitable place to survey such differences. The geometrical structure of rooms in schools is similar across different regions, and people of different ages are regularly present. Many studies have investigated schools to ﬁnd regional differences in 222Rn concentrations [14e16]. Moreover, children are generally thought to be more radiosensitive than adults and likely to be at greater risk of developing certain radiation-induced types of cancer [17]. No conclusive data exist to prove that children are at greater risk from 222Rn than adults [18,19], but it is difﬁcult to say that children would not be more affected. Hence, managing the risk of
222Rn  concentration  in  schools  is  important.  Both  children  and
adults spend a lot of time at schools; thus, the 222Rn radioactivity concentration of indoor air should be analyzed to estimate the ef- fect of 222Rn exposure.
The  mean indoor air 222Rn concentration  in houses in Korea  is
53 Bq/m3, which is 1.35  times  higher  than  the  global  average  (39 Bq/m3) [20]. In response to increased public awareness of and concerns about the hazards of 222Rn, the Ministry of Environment (ME) started the “indoor 222Rn control comprehensive plan” to reduce the risk caused by 222Rn. The Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety  started   a   national   222Rn survey  after  2000  [21e23],  and small-scale 222Rn surveys and research in subway  systems  in Korea have been conducted at universities and institutes [24e29]. The national 222Rn survey for public facilities has been conducted since 2008, based on  established recommendations as  a subplan  of the ME indoor 222Rn control comprehensive plan for 222Rn reduction. Indoor air 222Rn concentration has been measured in Ulju County every 2 years since 2008. The 222Rn survey for gov- ernment ofﬁces and elementary schools was conducted in 2008, while those for public buildings and residential houses were performed in 2009 and after 2010, respectively.  However,  only  ﬁve of 58 schools in Ulju County were surveyed. Insufﬁcient sampling of survey locations led to a signiﬁcant analysis deviation in the estimation of 222Rn effect in this area.
In the present study, an 222Rn survey and analysis for 57 schools in Ulju County was performed to secure the radiological safety of students, teachers, and ofﬁce workers and to provide basic infor- mation on reduction of 222Rn exposure. The risk due to 222Rn was calculated for different factors including subject, 222Rn level, dwelling times, and dose coefﬁcient.
2.Methods and materials
2.1.222Rn detector
A 222Rn LR-115 type passive detector, one of the detectors used to measure the time integral concentration of 222Rn in air, was used to survey 222Rn concentration in schools in Ulju County. The detector has a hollow cylindrical form with 4 cm diameter and
3 cm height (Fig. 1) [30]. The detector consists of a ﬁlter,  a detection part, and a connection part. The ﬁlter prevents  inert  gases other than 222Rn, from reaching the detection unit, thereby minimizing the effects of radioactive substances other than 222Rn. The detector has a solid-state track detector (SSTD) ﬁlm, which forms chemical imperfections because of the damage  of  the  atomic  arrangement  in  the  path  of  charged  particles  [31]. Thus,
222Rn passes  through  the ﬁlter  by diffusion  and emits  alpha  par-
ticles that create tracks on the SSTD surface. The depth  of  the alpha particles on the SSTD is on the order of a few tens of mi- crometers.  The  number  of  tracks  generated  is  converted  to  the
222Rn concentration to derive it at the measurement point. The
tracks created by the alpha particles are not  directly  readable using an optical microscope. Hence, etching was performed with 10%  NaOH  at 60○C for  150  min to enlarge  the  tracks  and   allow
analysis by optical microscope. The average number of tracks in the unit area was converted to the 222Rn concentration. The cor- relation between the 222Rn concentration and the tracks is pre- sented as follows [32]:

where x is the number of tracks with unit area (Tr/cm2), and y is the
222Rn concentration (Bq m3/day).
2.2.Survey design
A total of 57 of the 58 schools in Ulju County (one school was under reconstruction) were surveyed: 33 elementary, 13 middle, and 11 high schools. Figs. 2 and 3 show the locations of the schools and a geological map of Ulju County. The geology of Ulju County consists mostly of Mesozoic Cretaceous feature, except for allu- vium, which is of Cenozoic age.
222Rn concentration is lowest in summer and highest in winter
[33e35]. Hence, it was planned to measure 222Rn during the summer and the winter and during the middle season. 222Rn was

thus measured during summer, autumn, and winter to observe the increase of 222Rn concentration in Ulju County. June to August was deﬁned as summer, September to November as autumn, and December to February as winter. Three months were included for each season. We visited each school and set up detectors; it took 2 weeks to install devices and collect the data. A detector was placed in each of two rooms in each school for 3 months, unless it went missing or serious damage occurred during the survey. The number of lost or seriously damaged detectors was four in the summer, four in the autumn, and three in the winter, which seemed to have resulted from the instrument being small in size, open to students, and difﬁcult to manage in a continuous manner, making it easier for students to touch and for device to be damaged or lost. The measurement site was set up in similar rooms to suppress the occurrence of the same problem. The de- tectors were collected after 3 months and sent to Rn-tech, the manufacturer of the detectors, to analyze the track density in the detector and determine the indoor air 222Rn concentration. The series of analysis procedures were completed within a week. The detectors were kept sealed in Rn tight containers to prevent additional 222Rn exposure until they were sent. The detectors were gathered and replaced every 3 months in all locations. The measured 222Rn concentration of the detectors can be affected by thoron. Hence, they were placed at a distance of 1 m or more from the walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings. The detectors were hung from a string or turned upside down to allow air to circulate and prevent the inlet from closing.
The indoor air 222Rn concentrations between the seasons were compared. Moreover, the average and standard deviation were calculated for the elementary, middle, and high schools. The measured data were compared with the level recommended by the ME (148 Bq/m3), which is the same as the level recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (4 pCi/L), to ﬁnd whether an additional 222Rn reduction program was needed. The survey results were then compared with those of the national 222Rn sur- vey, including that conducted in Ulju County, performed by the ME in 2008. Raduet was used for the 222Rn survey in 2008. This de- tector can detect 222Rn and 220Rn at the same time. Hence, the inﬂuence of 220Rn can be relatively excluded by the short range of
220Rn caused by its short half-life. The detectors were installed in
ground ﬂoor ofﬁces to avoid loss and damage. The measurement dates start from June 2008, and it was agreed the month that this study began [23,36].
2.3.Regulation
222Rn concentration is regulated by the Indoor Air Quality Control in Public Use Facilities Act ME. The reference level of 222Rn concentration is 148 Bq/m3, which is the same as the level rec- ommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. Annual limit of intake for 222Rn is 3 MBq, and derived  air  concentration  is  1,000 Bq/m3 at allowable exhaust standards.
The International Commission on Radiological  Protection  (ICRP) provides guidelines for 222Rn regulation in indoor air at home and in the work place. ICRP recommends that exposure be maintained below 10 mSv per year [37]. Based on this level, ICRP recommends limiting  222Rn  concentration  to  300  Bq/m3  at  home and to 1,000 Bq/m3 in the work place, considering dwelling time spent in each area.
3.Dose calculations for 222Rn
A dose assessment was implemented to decide on the actual health risk caused by 222Rn. The effective dose depends on three factors: subjects, 222Rn concentrations, and dose coefﬁcient.
3.1.
Subjects
Three kinds of people (students, ofﬁce workers, and teachers) were assumed to dwell in schools, and each individual provided their behavior scenario at the school. Students are the dominant type of people in schools, and they spend most of their time in classrooms. Meanwhile, ofﬁce workers stay in the ofﬁce and teachers stay in two places in schools (ofﬁces and classrooms) during class hours. In terms of age, two types of people spend time in schools. The ﬁrst is adults, including teachers and ofﬁce workers. The second is children, the students. The dose calculations involved scenarios including what types of subjects dwelled in speciﬁc lo- cations and where the doses were estimated considering the different human respiratory tract models between children and adults. The effective dose was assessed for these subjects following each scenario.
Thus, there are three kinds of schools and three kinds of people in schools, so nine scenarios were derived for 222Rn dose assess- ment of schools in Ulju County.
3.2.222Rn concentrations
The 222Rn concentrations were the results of surveyed indoor air 222Rn concentrations. Surveyed 222Rn concentration was classiﬁed
according to the scenario of each subject. The 222Rn concentrations of each place for those subjects who dwell in two places in schools (i.e., classrooms and ofﬁces) were calculated accordingly.
3.3.Dose coefﬁcient
Many researchers have tried to determine the dose coefﬁcient of adults through epidemiological or simulation studies [38e43]. The International Commission on Radiological Protection collected research data on the dose coefﬁcient of 222Rn. They recommended that the effective dose per unit exposure at home should be 12 mSv per work level month, which is a single coefﬁcient for use in most circumstances [37,44e46]. This coefﬁcient can be converted to
4.5    10—6 mSv/(Bq h/m3) with an equilibrium factor of 0.4, which is the generally assumed value for the equilibrium state [47e50].
It is reported from human respiratory tract model analysis that this dose delivered to lungs is relatively insensitive to subject age [51]. Children have a lower breathing rate than adults, and their intakes are lower. However, the target tissue mass of children is also smaller, which causes the same effect in terms of effective dose. Therefore, the same dose coefﬁcient of 222Rn in adults is used in children.
3.4.Calculations
The effective dose during measurement time De is calculated as follows using the 222Rn concentration, dose coefﬁcient, and time [37]: @2
where As is the 222Rn concentration at the location at the season S (Bq/m3); Ceff is the dose coefﬁcient [1.76 × 10—2 mSv/(Bq/m3)] at an equilibrium factor of 0.4; and tdwell,S is the dwelling time at the season S (hours).
4.Results and discussion
4.1.Survey results
Table 1 and Figs. 4e7 show the seasonal variation of 222Rn concentration in elementary, middle, and high schools in Ulju County. The solid line is a trend line drawn using the collected data.
Table 1
Results of the 222Rn survey for 57 schools during three seasons.
The averages of the indoor air 222Rn concentration for the three seasons were less than the level recommended by the ME (148 Bq/  m3). All four graphs show log normal distribution. As a result ofﬁtting the graph, the R-square values are shown to be 0.95, 0.87, and 0.91 for the season and 0.96 for the annual average. The 222Rn concentration values of the elementary schools were higher than
those of the middle and high schools. The elementary school buildings in Ulju County are older than the middle and high school buildings by almost 20 years. Therefore, 222Rn concentration, some of which was contributed from geogenic Rn inﬁltrating through cracks, was thought to be relatively higher. Derived using the MATLAB code, Fig. 8 presents the geographical 222Rn distribution of Ulju  County  in  summer,  autumn,  and  winter  and  the  average values.The 222Rn at two locations was below the recommended level in summer but increased as the season changed to winter. The overall average eventually exceeded the recommended level.

The survey data were compared with those obtained by the ME in 2008 (Table 2). The 2008 survey was limited to an elementary school ofﬁce; thus, only relevant data were compared. The average indoor air 222Rn concentration for the three seasons, except spring, was surveyed and found to be 156 Bq/m3 and 51 Bq/m3 in 2008 and 2015, respectively; 222Rn concentration in this survey showed lower values. The data from 2008 were thought to have low representativeness of Ulju County and high deviation from true values because of the small number of sampling points (n 5). The present measurements for 33 elementary schools indicated the possibility of large variation caused by the characteristics of different sampling locations, including the geogenic variation of the
222Rn concentrations. The average of  the ﬁve highest values  herein
was 94 Bq/m3, which was lower than previously obtained ﬁgures. Accordingly, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed for the two data distributions. The p value was then derived to  ﬁnd any statistical  difference between  the  variances of
the two distributions. A p value less than 0.05 denoted a difference between the two distributions, while that of 0.0006 indicated a difference between the two results.
The statistical results of the survey for the seasons were analyzed through a one-way ANOVA. Table 3 presents the corre- sponding results. The survey results demonstrated a difference in the average of the 222Rn concentration. From a statistical point of view, the p value for the seasons in elementary schools was at least 0.12, which was a small value compared to 0.88 and 0.78 for the middle and high schools, respectively. This value was not enough to prove a difference in the 222Rn concentration in the air of the schools during different seasons.
Classifying the location of each school according to a geological map, 222Rn concentration as a geological feature  is  shown  in  Table 4.
Schools in Ulju County have at least one of six geological fea- tures: alluvium, black shale, biotite granite, hornblende granite,

andesite tuff, and rhyolite tuff. The number of schools on alluvium is highest at 32, followed by black shale at 16. Among the geological features, 222Rn concentration on biotite granite was the highest (97.12 Bq/m3).

4.2.Dose assessment for 222Rn
4.2.1.222Rn concentrations
The effective dose was assessed by seasonal concentration. First, the measurement places in schools were classiﬁed into two, as  follows: classroom (i.e., classroom, science room, and library, which the students mainly use) and ofﬁce (i.e., administration ofﬁce and teachers' room, which the ofﬁce workers and teachers mainly use). Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the activity concentrations depending on the type of place (e.g., classroom and ofﬁce).
The  222Rn  concentration  in  the  elementary  school classrooms
was the highest at 55 Bq/m3. Both the middle-school classrooms and ofﬁces had the lowest 222Rn concentration at 36 Bq/m3.
Fig. 9. 222Rn concentration in classrooms at schools.
Fig. 10. 222Rn concentration in ofﬁces at schools.
Standard deviations were calculated in the order of 47, 15, 8 Bq/m3 in classrooms and 30, 12, and 20 Bq/m3 in the ofﬁces of each elementary school, middle school, and high school. In terms of the type of place, the concentration in the classrooms was 15% higher than that in the ofﬁces. The statistical analysis results using a t test imply that the difference between classroom and ofﬁce cannot be veriﬁed because the p value was 0.25, higher than 0.05.
4.2.2.Dwelling time
The subjects who stay in the school had different regulation times. In dose calculation, we applied annual statutory class hours for students and the working hours of 2000 h for teachers and ofﬁcers, which was the normal Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) working hours [52]. The class and working hours for students and teachers, respectively, were equally divided by week, excluding the weeks that included vaca- tions and Thanksgiving Day. The residence time for each season was derived as shown in Table 5 considering the time of the survey and the period of vacation. A difference between the working and class hours was found in the case of teachers.
The dwelling times of students and teachers in spring and autumn were higher because of the long summer and winter vacation in schools. Moreover, the residence time increased in class as the student moved from elementary to high school.
4.2.3.Dose calculations
Table 6 shows the effective dose during the measured periods for students, teachers, and ofﬁce workers calculated for each type of school.
In Table 6, the children have the lowest effective dose because of their smallest dwelling time. The highest effective dose from 222Rn in elementary school was 0.41 mSv. The ofﬁce workers had the
Table 5
Reference time at schools.

highest effective dose among all subjects because they had the highest dwelling time.
4.2.4.Error analysis
Surveyed 222Rn concentration is an average value over 3 months. The students and the teachers do not stay in the classroom or ofﬁce, except during class hours or working hours. There is a difference in ventilation frequency according to whether people are present or not; 222Rn concentration is lower when people are present. In this experiment, average 222Rn concentration is used, which leads to an overestimation of the dose to people in schools. The phenomenon that nighttime had higher values than daytime has also been investigated in other articles [53,54].
In the present survey, the detector was installed on the ground ﬂoor, which was expected to have higher 222Rn concentrations than the upstairs ﬂoors [55,56]. General schools had many ground ﬂoor rooms, including administrative rooms and rooms for special classes. Therefore, 222Rn may be overestimated because the space  in which ordinary students spend time was in the upper ﬂoors. In schools, additional time is spent in school besides class time, for example supplementary study time and break time, which is not considered in this study. Actual residence time may be higher and, therefore, the dose received may be higher.
5.Conclusions
The indoor air 222Rn radioactivity concentration of 57 schools in Ulju County, including elementary, middle, and high schools, was analyzed using an integrated LR-115 dosimeter. Most schools in Ulju County maintain a level below the maximum recommended level of 222Rn radioactivity. However, some showed a concentration above the recommended level of 148 Bq/m3. Some areas with high
222Rn concentrations are assumed to be due to the presence of
biotite granite.
The dose assessment was conducted based on the types of schools and the main dwellers at the schools. The results show that elementary school ofﬁce workers had the highest dose at 0.54 mSv. The ICRP recommendation limit is 10 mSv per year, so the 222Rn concentration is over the level recommended by the ME; however, it was found to be an acceptable level when the surveyed results were converted into dose. The present survey results and dose assessment provide baseline data for establishing a 222Rn reduction policy at schools in Ulju County. A long-term survey and statistical analysis will be needed to ﬁnd accurate local 222Rn  characteristics of indoor air, depending on variables such as building age and the geological features of a rural/urban area.
