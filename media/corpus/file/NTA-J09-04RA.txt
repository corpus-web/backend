ABSTRACT
In this paper, we report on the radiation resistance of 50-micron thick Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGAD) manufactured at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) employing different dopings in the gain layer. LGADs with a gain layer made of Boron, Boron low-diffusion, Gallium, Carbonated Boron and Carbonated Gallium have    been designed and successfully produced at FBK. These sensors have been exposed to neutron fluences up to
𝜙𝑛  ∼  3 ⋅ 1016   𝑛∕𝑐𝑚2  and  to  proton  fluences  up  to  𝜙𝑝  ∼  9 ⋅ 1015   𝑝∕𝑐𝑚2  to  test  their  radiation  resistance.  The
experimental results show that Gallium-doped LGAD are more heavily affected by the initial acceptor removal mechanism than those doped with Boron, while the addition of Carbon reduces this effect both for Gallium and Boron doping. The Boron low-diffusion gain layer shows a higher radiation resistance than that of standard Boron implant, indicating a dependence of the initial acceptor removal mechanism upon the implant density.
Keywords: Silicon Timing LGAD
Acceptor removal
The LGAD design evolves the standard silicon sensors design by in- corporating low, controlled gain [1] in the signal formation mechanism. The overarching idea is to manufacture silicon detectors with signals large enough to assure excellent timing performance while maintainingalmost unchanged levels of noise [2].
Charge multiplication in silicon sensors happens when the chargecarriers (electrons and holes) are in electric fields of the order of 𝐸 ∼ 300
kV/cm [3]. Under this condition, the electrons (and to less extent the
holes) acquire sufficient kinetic energy to generate additional e/h pairs by impact ionization. Field values of ∼300 kV/cm can be obtained by implanting an appropriate acceptor (or donor) charge density 𝜌𝐴 (of the order 𝜌𝐴 ∼ 1016∕cm3) that, when depleted, locally generates very high fields. For this reason, an additional doping layer has been added at the
𝑛 − 𝑝 junction in the LGAD design, Fig. 1.
1.Initial acceptor removal in LGAD sensors
It has been shown in previous studies [4,5] that neutrons and charged hadrons irradiations reduce the value of gain in LGADs. This effect is due to the initial acceptor removal mechanism that progressively deactivates the acceptors forming the gain layer. The effects of initial acceptor removal on the silicon sensor bulk has been first measuredin standard Boron-doped silicon sensors more than 20 years ago [6]. Concurrently with the initial acceptor removal mechanism, irradiation causes also the creation of acceptor-like defects due to the creation of deep traps. The combined effects are described by Eq. (1) [2,7]
@1
where 𝑔𝑒𝑓 𝑓 = 0.02 [cm−1] (see for example chapter 5 of [8]), 𝜙 the irradiation fluence [ cm−2], 𝜌𝐴(0) (𝜌𝐴(𝜙)) the initial (after a fluence 𝜙) acceptor density [cm−3], and 𝑐  [cm2] is a constant that depends on the
initial acceptor concentration 𝜌𝐴(0) and on the type of irradiation. The first term of Eq. (1) accounts for acceptor creation by deep traps while
the second term for the initial acceptor removal mechanism. The factor
𝑐  can be rewritten as 𝜙𝑜  = 1∕𝑐, making more apparent its meaning: 𝜙𝑜 is the fluence needed to reduce the initial doping density 𝜌𝐴(0) to 1/e of its initial value.
The microscopic origin of the acceptor removal mechanism has not been fully understood, however, it is plausible that the progressive inac- tivation of the Boron atoms with irradiation happens via the formation of ion-acceptor complexes. In this model, the active (substitutionals) doping elements are removed from their lattice sites due to a 2-step process: (i) the radiation produces interstitial Si atoms that subsequently
Fig. 1. Schematic of a traditional silicon diode (left) and of a Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (right). The additional 𝑝+ layer underneath the 𝑛++ electrode creates, when depleted, a large electric field that generates charge multiplications.Fig. 2. Density of Boron atoms forming the gain layer in a new (M83) and a heavily irradiated (M80, irradiated to 1 ⋅ 1016  neq∕cm2 ) LGAD. Even though the gain layer of the M80 sensor is almost completely deactivated, M83 and M80 have the same gain layer doping profile (the plot has log-y and lin-x axis).
(ii) inactivate the doping elements via kick-out reactions (Watkins mech- anism [9]) that produce ion-acceptor complexes (interstitials) [10].
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) measurements support this view: Fig. 2 shows the densities of Boron atoms forming the gain layer as a function of depth in a new (M83) and a heavily irradiated
(M80, irradiated to 𝜙  ∼  1 ⋅ 1016  neq∕cm2) LGAD where the gain layerhas completely disappeared. Remarkably, the SIMS results are almost identical: the decrease of the active gain layer doping in irradiated sensors does not correspond to a disappearance of the Boron atoms, only to their inactivation. The SIMS were performed in the central area of 1 mm2 LGADs1.1.A parametrization of the acceptor removal mechanism
In a simple model of acceptor removal, the density of initial acceptor atoms deactivated by radiation is given by the product of the fluence
𝜙𝑜  times  the  silicon  atomic  density  𝜌𝑆𝑖  times  the  cross  section  for  an impinging particle to deactivate an acceptor 𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐 :@2
@3
where 𝜌𝑆𝑖 = 5 ⋅ 1022  cm−3. Following the two-step model outlined above, the expression of 𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐 can be written as the product of the cross section
between  radiation  and  Silicon  (𝜎𝑆𝑖)  times  the  number  of  interstitials generated in the scattering (𝑁𝐼𝑛𝑡) times the probability of capturing an Fig. 3. Proximity functions D1, D2, and D3. The value 𝜌𝐴𝑜 = 2.5 ⋅ 1016  n/cm3  has been used in this plot.
acceptor (𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝):
@4
Note that the presence of impurities (Carbon, Oxygen, . . . ) influence the value of 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝 as they might intercept the interstitial atoms before they reach the acceptors.
Eq. (2) assumes that each interstitial atom created by radiation is   in the proximity of acceptors, however this might not be the case at low acceptor density. For this reason, a proximity function 𝐷 needs to be included in Eq. (2): this function describes the probability that an interstitial atom is in the vicinity of an acceptor atom. The analytic form of 𝐷 is not unique, any smooth function that goes to 0 at low acceptor density and to 1 at large density is acceptable, for example:
@5
where 𝜌𝐴𝑜 is a fit parameter indicating the acceptor density at which an interstitial state has a probability of 0.5 of being in the vicinity       of an acceptor and 𝑛 is an exponent that needs to be determined
experimentally. Fig. 3 shows the values of D1, D2 and D3 (𝑛 = 1, 2       or 3) with 𝜌𝐴𝑜 = 2.5 ⋅ 1016 n/cm3.
Combining Eqs. (2) and (5), the expression linking the fluence 𝜙𝑜 to
the number of deactivated acceptors is:
@6
@7
where 𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐 and 𝜌𝐴𝑜 are fit parameters. Analytic expressions of 𝐷𝑛 using a linear (D1), a surface (D2) and a volumetric (D3) proximity function  were  tried,  finding  the  best  agreement  between  models  and
data  with  𝑛  =  2,  𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐   =  76 mb  ,  and  𝜌𝐴𝑜   =  2.5 ⋅ 1016   n/cm3. The
𝑛 = 2 result indicates that the clusters have a cylindrical shape since spherical shape would have yield to 𝑛 = 3. Using these numbers, the parameterizations of Eq. (6) without the proximity function and with
each of the three functions (D1, D2, and D3) are superposed in Fig. 4  to experimental points. The experimental points of B-neutrons (Boron gain layer irradiated with reactor neutrons) are taken from [11–13],  the B-protons (Boron gain layer irradiated with 800 MeV/c protons) from [11,13] while Ga-neutrons (Gallium gain layer irradiated with reactor neutrons) from [14,15].
The effect of the proximity function is important at low initial acceptor density, where the overlap probability between interstitial states and acceptors is small and therefore a higher fluence is needed to have initial acceptor removal. It is important to stress that the acceptor removal rate might differ upon the irradiation type (pions, protons, neutrons), the irradiation energy, and the acceptor element (Boron or
Fig. 4. The two plots show the parametrization of 𝑐 (bottom) and 𝜙𝑜 (top) from Eq. (6) together with experimental points as a function of the initial acceptor density. The top plot also shows the parametrization of Eq. (6) with and without the effect of the proximity functions. The best agreement data-parametrization is obtained with the D2 proximity function.
Gallium), however, for lack of statistics, Fig. 4 shows a single common fit.
Using the D2 parametrization, the absolute and relative effect of radiation on the initial acceptor density can be studied. The left plot of Fig. 5 reports the number of removed acceptors per incident particle per
cm3 as a function of 𝜌𝐴(0): it varies from 1 [cm−3] at 𝜌𝐴(0) = 1013 [cm−3] to ∼ 60 [cm−3] at 𝜌𝐴(0)  =  1019   [cm−3]. Even though the number    of removed acceptors increases with 𝜌𝐴(0), the fraction of removed acceptor is strongly decreasing as a function of 𝜌𝐴(0) (Fig. 5, right plot)
demonstrating that high initial acceptor densities are less affected by
radiation.
From the asymptotic behavior of the left plot of Fig. 5 we can measure  the  product  𝑁𝐼𝑛𝑡  ∗  𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝  and,  combining  this  value  with  the value of 𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐  = 76 mb , we can calculate 𝜎𝑆𝑖:
@8
@9
Both numbers are consistent with the results shown in [16] for 1 MeV neutron on Silicon: 𝜎𝑆𝑖 ∼ 4 mb and 𝑁𝐼𝑛𝑡 ∼ 200 − 300.
Finally, using the terms described above, the expression of the 𝑐
coefficient can be written as:
@10
where the capture coefficient 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝 depends upon the doping used for the gain layer and the presence of additional impurities such as Carbon or Oxygen.
Acceptor creation and initial acceptor removal mechanisms de- scribed by Eq. (1) happen concurrently in the multiplication layer as well as in the bulk. The evolutions of several initial doping densities as a
function of neutron fluence are shown schematically in Fig. 6: the initial Boron doping is removed as the fluence increases and in the meantime new acceptor-like states are created. At sufficiently high values of fluence, all initial doping values converge on the doping density of the high resistivity PiN diodes, indicating a complete disappearance of the initial acceptor density.
2.Production of LGAD with different gain layer doping
Three hypotheses have been put forward for the design of more radiation hard LGADs: (i) it has been reported in [15,17] that Gallium might be less prone than Boron to the Watkins mechanism, (ii) the presence of Carbon atoms might slow down the acceptor removal mechanism by producing ion-carbon complexes instead of ion-acceptor complexes, and (iii) a narrower doping layer with higher initial doping should be less prone to the acceptor removal mechanism than a wider doping layer with a lower initial doping.
To test these hypotheses, 50-μm thick LGAD sensors with 5 different
gain layer configurations have been manufactured at the Fondazione
Bruno Kessler1 : (i) Boron (B), (ii) Boron low-diffusion (B LD), (iii) Gallium (Ga), (iv) carbonated Boron (B+C), and (v) carbonated Gallium (Ga+C). This production is called UFSD2. It is important to note that carbon enrichment has been done uniquely in the volume of the  gain  layer  to  avoid  a  sharp  increase  of  the  leakage  current.  Details  on the
production have been presented in [18], a short summary of the UFSD2 production is shown in Table 1: 18 6-inch wafers were processed, 10
with a B-doped and 8 with a Ga-doped gain layer. The B-doped gain layer wafers W3–10 have 3 splits dose, in 2% steps, while the Ga-doped gain layer wafers W11–19 have also 3 splits of dose, however in 4% steps. Two splits of B-doped and one of the Ga-doped gain layers have been co- implanted with Carbon, with two different doses of Carbon. Two wafers
Fig. 5. The left plot shows the number of removed acceptor atoms per cm3 per incident particle: at the highest acceptor density ∼ 60 acceptors/cm3 are removed per incident particle. The right plot shows instead the fraction of acceptors removed per incident particle demonstrating that the importance of the acceptor removal mechanism is larger at low 𝜌𝐴(0) values.

of 𝑔𝑒𝑓 𝑓 = 0.02. The legend reports for each curve the initial acceptor density (in unit of [N∕cm3 ]) and the value of 𝑐  (indicated in the legend in unit of [10−16  cm2 ]) as  obtained
from the parametrization D2 shown in Fig. 4.

The Ga-doped wafers, given the higher diffusivity of Gallium, were also exposed to a reduced thermal load, however, the width of the resulting Gallium implant is nevertheless wider even than that of the B-doped gain layer with a high thermal load.
UFSD2 layout comprises of many hundreds of devices, from 1×1 mm2
single diodes to large arrays of pads and strips [18]. For this irradiation Table 1

the evolution of the LGAD behavior with fluence, as at each irradiation step the PiN diodes are used as a reference.
2.1.Properties of LGAD with different gain layer doping
Fig. 8 shows on the top pane representative 1/C2-V curves for B and B+C doped gain layers LGADs while on the bottom those of Ga and Ga+C doped gain layers. The voltage necessary to deplete the gain layer, 𝑉𝐺𝐿, is proportional to the average active doping 𝜌𝐴 in the gain layer:
@11where 𝑤 is the thickness of the gain layer, normally ∼ 1 μm, and 𝑞 the electron electric charge. Assuming a constant value of 𝑤, 𝑉𝐺𝐿 is directly proportional to 𝜌𝐴. In the 1/𝐶2-V curves, 𝑉𝐺𝐿 can be recognized as the  point where the 1/C2-V  curve  starts  a  sharp  increase,  while  the  voltage  of the diode full depletion,  𝑉𝐹 𝐷,  is  where  the  1/C2  becomes  constant. The voltage difference between 𝑉𝐹 𝐷 and 𝑉𝐺𝐿, 𝛥𝑉𝐵𝑢𝑙𝑘 = 𝑉𝐹 𝐷 − 𝑉𝐺𝐿, is proportional to the doping of the sensor bulk. For non irradiated sensors,
as those shown in Fig. 8, 𝛥𝑉𝐵𝑢𝑙𝑘  is of the order of a few volts indicating       a doping of 𝜌𝐵𝑢𝑙𝑘 ∼ 2 − 3 ⋅ 1012 atoms/cm3. We indicate 𝑉𝐺𝐿 measured with the 1/𝐶2-V curves with the symbol 𝑉 𝐶 .

It is visible in the plot that Carbon implantation reduces the activated fraction of Gallium, while the Carbon effects on Boron is minimal: 𝑉𝐺𝐿is on average 0.3 V smaller for B+C LGADs with respect to that of B
found in [19].
The measurements were taken with the Keysight B1505A parameter analyzer using as the model of the silicon detector a 𝐶𝑝 − 𝑅𝑝  circuit.
The 1/C2-V curves were obtained at room temperature with a probing
frequency of 1  kHz.  The  value  of  the  frequency  was  varied  between 1 and 3 kHz finding no dependence of the results on the operating frequency.  Analyzing  how  𝑅𝑝   changes  with  bias,  we  noticed  that in coincidence with 𝑉 𝐶 the 𝑅𝑝 curve presents a sharp decrease, allowing
for an easy identific𝐺a𝐿tion of the exact voltage of the gain layer depletion. We indicate 𝑉𝐺𝐿 measured with the 𝑅𝑃 -V curves with the symbol 𝑉 𝑅 .The correspondence between 𝑉 𝐶   and 𝑉 𝑅   is shown in Fig. 9 for a sen𝐺so𝐿rfrom W1 irradiated to 3⋅1015 n𝐺𝐿 cm2. 𝐺𝐿

3.Irradiation campaign irradiation campaign. A set of LGADs was irradiated without bias with
neutrons in the JSI research reactor of TRIGA type in Ljubljana. The
neutron spectrum and flux are well known [20] and the fluence is quoted in 1 MeV equivalent neutrons per cm2 (neq∕cm2). A different set  of LGADs was irradiated with protons at the IRRAD CERN irradiationfacility [21]. The IRRAD proton facility is located on the T8 beamline at the CERN PS East Hall where the primary proton beam witha momentum of 24 GeV/c is extracted from the PS ring. In IRRAD,
irradiation experiments are performed using the primary protons, prior reaching the beam dump located downstream of the T8 beam line. Afteirradiation, the devices were annealed for 80 min at 60 ◦C. Afterward, the devices were kept in cold storage at −20 ◦C. The table reports the actual number of protons: the fluences in neq∕cm2 can be obtained by
multiplying the proton fluences by the NIEL factor (NIEL = 0.6).

𝑐𝑝 is ± 1.5. The fourth and fifth columns report the 𝑐𝑝 values when the NIEL factor has been applied to the proton fluence.4.Simulation of different initial acceptor removal rate
As reported in Eq. (1), the initial acceptor removal effect is parame-
trized by the function 𝑐(𝜌𝐴(0)). Using the simulation program WF22  [22],
has been simulated. Fig. 10 reports the bias voltage needed to keep
a constant gain value = 10 as a function of neutron fluence for the  situation where the value of 𝑐(𝜌𝐴(0)) is twice, a half or a quarter of the
presently measured value of 𝑐(𝜌𝐴(0)) = 2 − 3 ⋅ 10−16 cm−3 ∼ 6 ⋅ 10−16 cm2.
The simulation has  been  calculated  using  the  parametrization  shown in Eq. (1), with 𝑔𝑒𝑓 𝑓 = 0.02 cm−1 and the 𝑐 values (in unit of [10−16 cm2]) shown in the legend. On the plot, the measured points from Hamamatsu
LGADs are also reported [5].
As Fig. 10 shows, when the gain layer doping is progressively deactivated by irradiation, the bias voltage should be increased to compensate for the reduction of the electric field generated by the gain layer. Smaller values of 𝑐 move the need to increase the bias voltage to progressively higher fluences, making LGAD operation more stable.

Comparing the 4 plots in Fig. 11, it is evident that the slopes of the 1/C2 curves at equal fluence are similar, indicating, via equation (12), that the doping of the bulk is evolving in the same way for all sensors.
The 𝑐(𝜌𝐴(0)) coefficient can be measured by fitting an exponential function to the fraction of still active gain layer as a function of fluence,
as shown in Eq. (13):@13

assigned to the determination of 𝑐𝑛  while, given the presence of only

Several results can be extracted from Table 4 :
•The addition of Carbon improves the radiation resistance: the 𝑐𝑛, 𝑐𝑝 coefficients are about a factor of two smaller for B+C and Ga+C LGADs with respect of those of B or Ga. Since no other condition

besides the addition of Carbon was changed, we can determine that the presence of Carbon reduces the value of the coefficient
layer can withstand more than twice the radiation of a non-carbonated gain layer.
Fig.  10.  Evolution of the bias voltage needed to obtain a constant value of gain, G = 10, as a function of fluence: as the gain layer doping is progressively deactivated by irradiation,      the bias voltage is increased to compensate for the reduction of the electric field generated by the gain layer. The figure shows how a change in the value of the 𝑐 exponent (in unit of  [10−16 cm2 ]) changes this evolution.

•Considering the real value of proton fluences, the measured 𝑐𝑝 and
𝑐𝑛 coefficients are compatible with each other, albeit the 𝑐𝑝  values  are consistently higher. This effect indicates that the cross section to remove an acceptor, 𝜎𝐴𝑐𝑐  = 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝 ⋅𝑁𝐼𝑛𝑡 ⋅𝜎𝑆𝑖, is similar for a 1 MeV
neutron and a 24 GeV/c proton.
•If the NIEL factor is applied to the protons fluence (NIEL = 0.6 for 24 GeV/c protons), the 𝑐𝑝 factors are almost twice 𝑐𝑛.
•Narrower and more doped gain layer implants are less prone to initial acceptor removal: B LD has a lower 𝑐𝑛 coefficient than B. This is consistent with the expectation from the right pane of   Fig. 5 that shows that the relative importance of acceptor removal
decreases with increasing initial doping density 𝜌𝐴(0).
W3 and W8, however, the difference is larger than what it would be just due to this effect. This fact might indicate a higher acceptor removal rate of Gallium doping with respect of that of Boron doping. In [15], a lower acceptor removal rate of Gallium has been measured with respect of the data reported in this work, however, the reason might be that the initial Gallium density in [15] was higher than that of this work.
The gain in LGADs is required to be 20–30: this fact determines that the total amount of doping in the gain layer is roughly a constant in every LGAD. This given amount of doping can be distributed over narrower or wider implants, varying the doping density: equation (6) predicts that in LGADs with wider and less doped implants the initial

those for Boron doping. This difference is partly due to the lower

Fig. 14: the plot clearly shows that in wider implants the initial acceptor removal mechanism is faster. This effect holds true also for carbonated gain layers.
A compilation of values of 𝜙𝑜 for neutron irradiation measured in this work and in   [11–15] is shown in Fig. 15. All sensors are ∼50-   μm thick, however, they differ slightly in the doping profile as they  do
not all have the same gain. The plot reports measurements for LGADs
manufactured by CNM with a Gallium or a Boron gain layer, 4 different types of Boron LGADs manufactured by HPK (indicated with the names 50A, 50B, 50C and 50D in order of increasing gain layer doping levels) and several LGADs manufactured by FBK. The carbonated gain layers
have clearly the largest values of 𝜙𝑜, followed by B LD: the 1/e fluence for B+C LGADs is almost 0.5 ⋅ 1016  neq∕cm2.
Fig. 16 updates Fig. 4 including the results obtained in this analysis: the new points cluster around 𝜌𝐴(0) ∼ 2 − 6 ⋅ 1016. The value of 𝜌𝐴(0) has been obtained by computing the gain layer doping profile using the
relationship, shown in Eq. (12), between the derivative of the curve
1∕𝐶2 − 𝑉 and the doping at a depth 𝑤.
7.Measurement of the gain due to the gain-layer after a fluence of
𝝓 = 𝟖 ⋅ 𝟏𝟎𝟏𝟒,  𝟏.𝟓 ⋅ 𝟏𝟎𝟏𝟓  and 𝟑 ⋅ 𝟏𝟎𝟏𝟓  neq∕𝐜𝐦𝟐.
Using a collimated picosecond laser system with a light spot diameter of ∼ 20 μm and a wavelength of 1064 nm, the gains of B, B LD, B+C,  Ga and Ga+C LGADs were measured as a function of bias voltage for 3 neutron irradiation levels: 𝜙 = 8 ⋅ 1014, 1.5 ⋅ 1015 and 3 ⋅ 1015 𝑛∕cm2. The
value of the gain was obtained as the ratio of the signal areas obtained in an LGAD and in a PiN diode irradiated to the same fluence.
The results are shown in Fig. 17: the top left plot shows the gain curves before irradiation, while the following 5 plots show the gain normalized to the respective unirradiated gain at Bias = 150 V. As expected, B+C is the most radiation resistant LGAD: after a fluence of
8 ⋅ 1014  neq∕cm2  the gain layer still generate at bias = 500 V the same
gain as it had when not irradiated at bias = 150 V. Likewise, Ga is the weakest retaining at 500 V only 10% of the initial gain.
Confirming the results on the values of the 𝑐𝑛 coefficient, carbonated gain layers (B+C and Ga+C) show higher gain values than those without Carbon for the same fluence level. Likewise, B LD maintains higher gain
values than B; at 𝜙 = 3 ⋅ 1015 𝑛∕cm2 only B+C gain layer is still active. It
is possible that by optimizing the Carbon dose this effect can be further enhanced.
8.Conclusions and outlook
50-μm thick LGADs manufactured by FBK with 5 different types of gain layer doping (B, B+C, Ga, Ga+C and B LD) have been irradiated
with neutrons and protons. The results show that (i) carbonated gain layer are at least a factor of two more radiation resistant than the equiv- alent non-carbonated gain layer, (ii) Gallium doping is less radiation resistant than Boron doping, (iii) narrower gain layer implants are more radiation resistant than wider implants, (iv) considering the true fluence value, protons with 24 GeV/c momentum are similarly harmful than

Carbonated gain layer holds the possibility of designing silicon sensors with gain with enhanced radiation resistance. We plan to further investigate the property of carbonated gain layer by producing gain layers with several carbon doses, to optimize the radiation resistance of the LGAD design. We are confident that these findings, albeit obtained for LGAD sensors, can be successfully implemented in other silicon sensors with gain such as SiPM and APD.
