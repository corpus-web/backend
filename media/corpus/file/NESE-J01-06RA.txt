<Section>Abstract</Section>
Venting system, mainly composed of bursting discs, is designed to protect the structural integrity of the cabins in nuclear power plants (NPPs). During a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), much gas is rapidly released into the cabin, forming a kind of pressure longitudinal wave (PLW) named “blasting wave” and challenge the mechanical strength of the envelope structure. Simulation of the blasting wave is meaningful for designing bursting discs. CFD is a generic method for cabins with arbitrary geometric features, which consumes much time and computing resource; There exists a mathematical model based on wave equation describing PLW, but it has never been applied in the field of nuclear reactor accident because of some bottlenecks. In this study, the mathematical model based on wave equation is transformed into a generic method of simulating PLW without solving velocity field, which is in the form of a velocity-free PDE problem with velocity-related initial and boundary conditions. The boundary condition is not Dirichlet, Neumann nor Robbin, and provides condition for one-dimensional analytical solution. The problem can also be solved by finite element method (FEM). Both solutions are validated by CFD simulation in our previous study and can be extended to higher dimensions. In engineering application, the analytical solution can be directly used if the cabin’s geometry is relatively simple, while FEM solution can be used on a coarse meshing if the geometry is complex. Both applications are convenient compared with CFD method.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
When a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) takes place in a certain cabin of a nuclear power plant (NPP), much vapor (in a pressurized water reactor NPP) or helium (in a high temperature gas-cooled reactor NPP) with high temperature and pressure is released from a broken piping of the primary circuit (Yang et al., 2019a, Chen et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2016, Fernández-Cosials et al., 2017), causing the pressure in the cabin to raise rapidly (Jiang et al., 2002, Li et al., 2020) and to distribute extremely unevenly (Yang et al., 2019b, Li et al., 2018). This phenomenon is the result of the propagation of pressure longitudinal wave (Du et al., 2020). We will call it “blasting wave” below.
The containment of light water reactor NPPs are commonly made of prestressed reinforced concrete with steel lining, whose pressure bearing capacity is about pciv = 0.5–1.3 MPa.r (Tong et al., 2018, Bílý and Kohoutková, 2018, Alhanaee et al., 2018). The vented low pressure containment (VLPC) of high temperature gas-cooled reactor NPPs are made of prestressed reinforced concrete without steel lining, whose pressure bearing capacity is about  (Altes, 1993, Jiang et al., 2002). If the peak of the blasting wave exceeds the corresponding pressure bearing capacity, the containment is attacked and cracks could appear. At this time, the structural integrity of the containment is damaged.
For the above reasons, the venting system, composed mainly of bursting discs, is designed as a nuclear safety system for NPPs (Yang et al., 2018, Lebel et al., 2017). Its major function is to provide pressure relief service after a LOCA. Limited by objective conditions, bursting discs are commonly designed at preset positions that HVAC engineers have no authority to modify, so the maximum pressure  in the cabin generally does not appear precisely at the bursting disc. The core issue is:
Core Issue: Design the pressure threshold  of bursting disc to ensure  in the cabin after a LOCA, in other words, to solve the maximum value of .
In the workflow of HTR-PM600 engineering design, LOCA is quantitatively described by a peak flow rate , indicating the volume of gas at normal temperature and pressure (N.T.P) equivalent to the high temperature (~700 ℃) high pressure (~7 MPa) helium leaked from the broken piping in unit time. In fact, the leak flow rate of helium attenuates over time during LOCA, but the attenuation is ignored for a conservative design of bursting discs.
Laws of the propagation of the blasting wave in the containment of an NPP following LOCA should be studied and summarized systematically so that the core issue could be solved. But very little literature we retrieved discusses this issue. Three typical pressure longitudinal waves, which have similar features with the blasting wave of our interest, are studied extensively:
The shock wave, appearing in fluid piping systems following the sudden action (i.e. open or close) of a valve, which is very destructive to piping;
Blood pressure wave, appearing in the circulatory system of the human body, which is produced by the pumping action (i.e. contraction and relaxation) of heart;
The deflagration wave, appearing in the mixture of flammable gas and air. “Deflagration” is caused by either spontaneous or manual ignition while flammable gas is rapidly injected into air, which causes a sudden rise of local temperature.
The related works of literature are reviewed and summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Literature review on three typical pressure longitudinal waves.
From the literature review, we see that the main methods to study pressure waves are computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation (based on Navier-Stokes equations) and experiment. Meanwhile, simulations based on wave equation Eq. (12a) appear in some of the literature (Ben-Dor et al., 2001, Ilyin, 2019). The following facts contribute to the smooth development of such studies:
1)
Liquid is much less elastic than gas, so the flow velocity field in liquid piping or blood vessel is hardly influenced by the propagation of shock wave. So it is natural to solve pressure or density field without concerning velocity;
2)
Constant pressure devices in liquid piping and systolic/diastolic pressures of heart in the blood circulatory system both provide pressure boundary conditions for simulation. In contrast, the broken piping in the containment of NPP provides a velocity boundary condition, which is not explicitly included in wave equation;
3)
The parameter “wave speed, ” in wave equation eq. (12a) is related to fluid elasticity, which is constant in liquid. In contrast, it is affected by temperature, molecular weight, and turbulence of gas (Du et al., 2020).
Note that we are trying to design the venting system of an NPP dealing with LOCA, it is hard to design and perform an experiment with an acceptable cost that can guide engineering reliably. So CFD simulation seems to be the only method to solve the core issue. It is a generic method to study all kinds of pressure longitudinal wave that works regardless of the complexity of geometry features, but it consumes much time and computing resource. Set HTR-PM600 standard design as an example, the meshing contains millions of elements for reliable results. It takes several days to compute a single working condition, and the design of one bursting disc needs multiple working conditions. So, it takes several months to design the venting system for a single cabin. The size of the simulation data of a single working condition is 10–100 Gigabytes.
The above situations show that CFD simulation is very inconvenient in the engineering design of venting systems. The simulation method based on the wave equation should be modified so that it can be applied in the simulation of blasting wave in the containment of an NPP. Especially, the velocity boundary conditions should be dealt with.
This study will be arranged as follows:
Firstly, the governing partial differential equation (PDE) initial boundary value problem of blasting wave, based on wave equation, is derived from fluid dynamics, where velocity boundary conditions are converted into pressure boundary conditions, in other words, pressure and velocity fields are “decoupled”. The problem is solved analytically and by finite element method (FEM). (Section 2)
Secondly, the one dimensional analytical and FEM solutions are compared with the CFD case study from the HTR-PM600 engineering design. The solutions will be proved to agree with the results of the CFD simulation. Some discussion will be made as well. (Section 3)
Finally, the engineering application of the blasting wave mathematical model will be introduced. And some conclusions will be drawn. (Section 4)
2. Blasting wave PDE and solutions
2.1. Basics and assumptions
The functions @, @, @ describe how the scalar field pressure, the scalar field density, and the vector field velocity, vary with location @ and time .
Let  be the interior space of the cabin to be designed. Momentum equation (also known as Navier-Stokes equation) is expressed as Eq. (1) (Sheng, 2019).
@(1)
where @ is body force, @ is dynamic viscosity. The Law of conservation of mass is expressed as Eq. (2) (Kundu et al., 2016).
@(2)
The state equation of the fluid (i.e. air) is expressed as the simplest form – proportional relationship.
@(3)
We claim that % is a constant if the case is not too hot (temperature 300–500 K), the pressure is not too high (relative pressure 0–1.3 MPa) and the turbulence is not too strong (dissipation rate ε<10). This claim brings a relative error of <1% (Cengel and Boles, 2019, Du et al., 2020). If the claim is not satisfied, an additional equation describing the distribution of % should be introduced. So that influence of temperature, gas species, flow turbulence, and other parameters on %, and thus on the propagation of blasting wave, is taken into account.
Note that we are studying the propagation of a kind of pressure longitudinal wave in the air, it is believed that the magnitude of u is very small all over Ω, so its second-order differential terms are all negligible; gravity force is the only body force “f”, which is negligible as well. That is:
@(4)
Now that Eq. (1) is simplified into Eq. (5).
@(5)
Note that p appears only once in Eqs. (5), (2), we decide to use density  to describe the blasting wave.
2.2. Wave equation initial boundary value problem
Act “@” on Eq. (5) and “@” on Eq. (2) yields:
@(6)
Eliminate the same item , Eq. (7) is deduced.
@(7)
This is the standard form of wave equation. Wave speed .
Although the broken piping is inside the cabin when LOCA takes place, the fluid inlet is commonly placed at the boundary so that law of conservation of mass Eq. (2) holds all over . The inlet boundary condition is written by Eq. (8) in CFD.
@(8)
where u0 is the airflow speed at the inlet boundary, which is a known constant;  is the normal direction of the inlet boundary, which is a known vector;  indicates the inlet boundary, which is a subset of . Substitute Eq. (8) to Eq. (2) yields:
@(9)
where @ is the derivative of density  in the normal direction of .
Let [0, dt] be a so short period just after LOCA takes place that the air in Ω is still static, the blasting wave propagates a distance of . So the subset region of  affected by the air leakage at the inlet is the column “@” shown in Fig. 1. Apply Eq. (3) to region @ yields:
@(10)
where @ is the area of @,  is the initial density of air on the boundary ;ρin is the density of air at standard condition, i.e. the uniformly distributed density in Ω at t=0.
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of regions and their symbols.
In summary, the governing PDE initial boundary value problem of the longitudinal wave can be written as Eq. (11).
@(11)
PDE problem Eq. (11) has some interesting properties compared with the equations for CFD simulation:
Firstly, Eq. (11a) has the standard form of wave equation. Many mathematical tools have been developed to study it Evans (1964), such as D’Alembert general solution and spherical mean, etc.
Secondly, the number of unknown function in Eq. (11) is only one (ρ), while that in CFD equations is six (@) if the standard  turbulence model is applied. So the difficulty of the solution is greatly reduced.
Thirdly, note that Eqs. (11b), (11c), (11d) are boundary conditions, where velocity field  is included. Eq. (11a) is the PDE, where velocity field  is not included. So  and  are decoupled. The decoupled  and  provide a condition for solving density (or pressure) field without solving the velocity field. This is why the calculation method introduced in this study is claimed to be “velocity free” in the title;
Finally, the boundary condition Eq. (11b) can not be classified as Dirichlet, Neumann nor Robbin boundary condition. In literature, Eq. (11b) is named “absorbing boundary condition” (Kaltenbacher and Nikolić, 2019, Lee and Tassoulas, 2019, Pölz et al., 2016). It provides a relationship between the two undetermined functions in D’Alembert general solution, which plays an important part in deriving analytic expressions.
2.3. One dimensional analytical solution
The 1D problem can be written as Eq. (12), which is a dimensionality reduction of Eq. (11):
@(12)
The D’Alembert general solution of Eq. (12a) is:
@(13)
where @ and @ are functions that should be determined by boundary and initial conditions Eqs. (12b)–(12e). The independent variables of  and  are represented by  in the following.
Substitute Eq. (13) to Eq. (12b) yields:
@(14)
Define inlet Mach number:
@(15)
Then Eq. (14) can be rewritten by:
@(16)
where IC is an integral constant. Substitute Eq. (13) to Eqs. (12c) and (12e) yields:
@(17)
where @ is Kronecker delta function with the definition:
(18)
Substitute Eq. (13) to Eqs. (12d) yields:
@(19)
Eqs. (16), (17) yield:
@(20)
Then @ and @ are analytically expressed on interval :
@(21)
@(22)
Eq. (19) is the basis for extending the domain of Eqs. (21), (22):
@(23)
The integral constant  can be determined by the continuity of ρ(x,t). Its physical meaning is the amplitude of the blasting wave.
To sum up, the two functions @ and @ are well defined by Eqs. (21), (22), (23). So @ has been analytically expressed. It is concise enough for engineering applications.
It should be emphasized that boundary condition at the inlet Eqs. (11b) and (12b) lead to an explicit relationship, Eq. (19), between @ and @. The relationship helps to extend the domain of  and , so that Eq. (13) can be analytically expressed on @ and @. We will try to amend the boundary conditions in eq. (12) so that they can be suitable for more cases.
Note that the boundary condition at  Eq. (12d) is zero normal gradient of pressure, which means “airtight wall” in engineering. Eqs. (21), (22), (23) can only describe the blasting wave before the bursting disc bursts.
Consider the case in which bursting disc at  has already burst, so the pressure relief process has started. One possible description is to set the relative pressure at 0 Pa at , that is:
@(24)
where  is the time of burst,  is the density distribution at  which is a known function. In this case . Use Eq. (24) to replace Eqs. (12c)–(12e),  and  can also be solved. Denote them by  and . The subscript “b” means “burst” situation. With a similar calculation process:
@(25)
where  is the characteristic function of the interval ;  is the complementary set of interval  in the real domain.
Note that the pressure relief process can only last  seconds, pressure in the cabin keeps atmospheric after that.
Further, consider the same case (i.e. the bursting disc at  has already burst). Another possible situation is that there exist non-negligible resistance components (such as valves, long ducting, or elbow) outside the bursting disc. Normally the resistance is quantitatively expressed as:
@(26)
where @ is the resistance coefficient which is known when the ducting is installed;  is the air velocity at the bursting disc. Substitute Eqs. (4), (9) to Eq. (26) and note that  yields:
@(27)
In 2D and 3D cases, use Eq. (28) on the outlet boundary .
@(28)
Use Eqs. (27) and (24b) to replace Eqs. (12c)–(12e),  and  can also be solved. Denote them by  and . The subscript “r” means “resistance” situation. It can be calculated:
@(29)
where@
Eq. (29c) is the basis for extending the domain of Eqs. (29a) and (29b). Note the continuity of , Eq. (29e) is well defined.
2.4. FEM solution
FEM is suitable for solving wave equation (11) whether the dimension is 1, 2 or 3 (Mahmoodi et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019). A concrete realization of this method under the 1D situation will be given next.
As shown in Fig. 2. A line segment with length L is selected as the computational domain, denoted by . It is cut into  elements by  nodes evenly:
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of 1D discretization in FEM.
Select a time step , and discretize  into:
@(30)
For @, only Eq. (12a) work. The differential terms are replaced by:
@(31)
@(32)
In particular, the term @ is expressed by values of adjacent 5 points in our study, so that it has fourth-order accuracy (Phillips and Taylor, 1996). This is to provide convenience for the expression of inlet and outlet boundary conditions.
For @, the initial condition is evaluated.
@(33)
For @, the inlet boundary condition is evaluated.
@(34)
For @, outlet boundary condition, i.e. zero gradient of density, is evaluated.
@(35)
If burst situation Eq. (24) or resistance situation Eq. (27) is considered, the outlet boundary condition Eq. (35) should be replaced by:
@(36)
@(37)
where superscripts @ and @ represent “burst” and “resistance” situations, respectively.
The above-mentioned FEM has been programmed in Python.
<Section>3. Results and Discussion: Comparison with 3D CFD simulation</Section>
3.1. Case description
In the HTR-PM600 preliminary design, the corridor holds primary circuit helium piping, equipment cooling water piping, air conditioning chilled water piping, cable trays, etc. It lies between the internal and external two-layer cylindrical containment and has a slender shape. The geometry of the corridor is shown in Fig. 3(a), a bursting disc is installed at the east ending, inlets are set at the west ending because the worst condition is considered, in which LOCA happens as far as possible from the bursting disc.
Fig. 3. Corridor of HTR-PM600 – (a) geometry and (b) 1D modeling.
The previous study shows that propagation of blasting wave following LOCA in the corridor has been studied using CFD simulations, whose numerical error has been estimated by grid convergence testing method (Du et al., 2020). Some major information about the simulations is listed in Table 2. The previous study may be referred to for a more detailed description of the simulations. We believe that the results of that study are reliable enough, and they can be used to validate the mathematical model proposed in Section 2.
Table 2. Major information about the simulations in our previous study (Du et al., 2020).
.
The one-dimensional modeling of the corridor is shown in Fig. 3(b). Note that:
1)
The flow velocity at the inlet can only face north, like Inlet B in Fig. 3(a);
2)
The bursting disc can only face south but it faces up in Fig. 3(a);
3)
The 1D model is a right cylinder without diameter change, while the corridor is actually curved and there exists a sudden contraction.
It is clear that 1D modeling is a relatively rough version of the corridor where many geometric details are ignored. So, we do not expect the 1D analytical and FEM solutions introduced in Section 2 to fit accurately with the CFD simulation results in Du et al. (2020).
Settle for second best, the motion of wavefront, amplitude, and reflection of the blasting wave are focused on. If the 1D analytical and FEM solutions introduced in Section 2 could describe these properties as CFD simulation did, we would conclude that the 1D modeling is valid.
3.2. Analytical solution versus CFD
3.2.1. Wave propagation plot
Fig. 4(a) shows the analytical solution eq. (13) defined by Eqs. (21), (22), (23). The dependent variable “density, ” has been multiplied by  or  so that pressure is set as ordinate. Distribution of pressure has been plotted every 0.2 s, and black hollow arrows are plotted to indicate the blasting wave’s direction of propagation.
Fig. 4. Plot of blasting wave in corridor following LOCA: analytical solution versus CFD Remark: (a) Analytical Solution; (b) CFD simulation result by Du et al. (2020); Black hollow arrows in subplot (a) indicate the wave’s direction of propagation.
To compare with the CFD simulation results in our previous study (Du et al.,2020), shown in Fig. 4(b), the time of LOCA taking place has been adjusted. It is thus clear that:
1)
Eq. (13) can clearly describe the temporal and spatial distribution of blasting wave, and the result is similar to that of CFD simulation.
2)
The wavefront calculated from eq. (13) is sharp throughout as time goes by, but that from CFD simulation is gradually blurred. This is caused by the sudden contraction and curved geometry. We may try to analytically solve eq. (11) in 2D and 3D spaces in further studies, so that the analytical method would adapt to more complex geometries.
3)
The amplitude of the blasting wave shown in Fig. 4(a) is a little smaller than that of CFD simulation in Fig. 4(b). This is because of the inaccuracy of  at inlet.
3.2.2. Discussion on 2D and 3D extension of analytical solution
The extension of D’Alembert solution Eq. (13) to 2D and 3D situations is not obvious, which needs mathematical tools called “spherical means” (Haltmeier and Pereverzyev, 2015, Shi and Liu, 2018) and “Hadamard method of descent” (Bray, 2007). These tools have achieved interesting results in some simple cases. For example, the solution of Eqs. (38), (39) are called Kirchhoff formula (Eq. 40) and Poisson formula (Eq. 41), respectively (Evans, 1964).
@(38)
@(39)
@(40)
@(41)
where @ is a pre-set location that we are interested in@;@ ; .
From the 3D analytical solution Eq. (40) we can see that:
Theorem 1: Density ρ at position (X,Y,Z) is not affected by the initial condition outside the ball with radius @.
Theorem 1 Is also called the “Huygens principle” (Kulczycki and Malec, 2017, Liu and Noh, 2015), which is an extensively studied property of waves.
The differences between Eqs. (11), (38) are:
a)
The domain of Eq. (11) is , which is a proper subset of that of Eq. (38), ;
b)
Eq. (11) includes some boundary conditions that are not included in Eq. (38).
In future research, we may detailedly discuss the method of extending the domain of Eq. (11) concerning different kinds of boundary conditions, especially the absorbing boundary condition Eq. (11b) which is not Dirichlet, Neumann nor Robin. So that the solution of Eq. (11) would be analytically expressed in a similar form to Eqs. (40), (41).
Compared to the 1D D’Alembert solution Eq. (13), the 2D and 3D solutions seem not that perfect in the following aspects:
a)
They could be analytically expressed only if the position (X,Y,Z) is pre-set;
b)
Extension of the domain depends strongly on the geometry of the cabin, i.e., “” in Eq. (11). So too complex geometry would reduce their practical value;
c)
They contain spherical integral terms that need a much larger quantity of calculation.
However, they save much calculation and, most important of all, avoid numerical errors compared with FEM and CFD simulations. So, settle for second best, 2D and 3D analytical solutions could be treated as validation tools of FEM. Steps are as follows:
a)
Use a very coarse meshing to perform 2D or 3D FEM calculation on the entire cabin region.
b)
Calculate the analytical solution on a ball-shaped local subregion of the cabin, where the ball was the biggest one properly included in the domain.
c)
Estimate the error between the FEM solution in step a) and the analytical solution in step b). If it were not acceptable, refine the meshing and back to step a), otherwise the FEM solution in step a) is trusted.
In this way, the cases in which excessively fine meshing is applied to perform FEM could be avoided with the help of 2D or 3D analytical solutions.
3.3. FEM solution versus CFD
3.3.1. Altering time step in FEM
Set the number of elements at 200, set the time step at 4E−5, 3E−5, and 2E−5 s to perform FEM calculation introduced in Section 2.4. Fig. 5 are the results, respectively. It is thus clear that:
a)
Numerical dispersion always exists regardless of the time step, making the wavefront not as sharp as that calculated by the analytical solution.
b)
Too long time step causes the amplitude of blasting wave to attenuate abnormally. So it is necessary to change time step multiple times to make sure the error is acceptable.
Fig. 5. Plot of blasting wave in corridor following LOCA: altering time step in FEM solution Remark: (a) 200 nodes, time step = 4E−5 s; (b) 200 nodes, time step = 3E−5 s; (c) 200 nodes, time step = 2E−5 s.
3.3.2. Altering number of elements in FEM
Set the time step at 1E−5 s, set the number of elements at 50, 100, 150, and 200 to perform FEM calculation. Fig. 6(a)–(d) are the results, respectively. It is thus clear that:
a)
Numerical dispersion always exists, making the wavefront not as sharp as that calculated by the analytical solution. And it is increasingly obvious as the number of elements decreases.
b)
The number of elements does not influence the amplitude of the blasting wave.
c)
As the number of elements increases, the wave seems to travel faster. This phenomenon is caused by the following reason: Eqs. (34), (35), (36), (37) make the wave pass by the four boundary nodes at both ends in a single time step, causing the total length of the computational domain seems to “shorten”.
Fig. 6. Plot of blasting wave in corridor following LOCA: altering number of elements in FEM solution Remark: (a) 50 nodes, time step = 1E−5 s; (b) 100 nodes, time step = 1E−5 s; (c) 150 nodes, time step = 1E−5 s; (d) 200 nodes, time step = 1E−5 s.
Define dimensionless Courant number:
@(42)
where H is the characteristic scale of elements. We suggest a criterion of the selection of time step and the number of elements according to Fig. 5, Fig. 6, that is, .
3.3.3. Discussion on numerical dispersion phenomenon
Although numerical dispersion does not influence much on the description of wave propagation, the FEM solutions shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 are clearly suffering from it. In fact, reduction of dispersion is a problem of longstanding interest in the field of computational physics and fluid dynamics (Bilbao and Hamilton, 2018). Castiglioni et al. (2019) estimated the numerical dispersion of several numerical schemes using the general form of PDEs in fluid dynamics. Many methods have been studied to reduce the numerical dispersion of wave equation, such as optimal tuning factors (Park and Kausel, 2003), dispersion reduction schemes introduced by An (2017), dispersion-improved CABARET schemes introduced by Chintagunta et al. (2018), minimization of dispersion error method introduced by Wu and Alkhalifah (2018) and so on.
However, the above-mentioned methods could not perform satisfactorily in the numerical dispersion reduction of Eq. (11). So, this issue is well worth further study in our future work.
3.3.4. Discussion on more complex geometry
It has been shown clearly that 1D analytical and FEM solutions can not fit well with complex geometry. An idea of improvement is to solve eq. (11) by FEM on a meshing similar to that in CFD simulation. The results shown above give us the confidence to use very coarse meshing to perform the FEM calculation without worrying about the loss of accuracy. Therefore, our FEM solution is a generic method for complex geometry, being able to reliably and quickly simulate the propagation of blasting wave following LOCA in the confinement of a nuclear power plant.
<Section>4. Conclusion</Section>
We have developed a mathematical model based on the wave equation to describe the propagation of blasting wave following LOCA in the confinement of a nuclear power plant. The model can replace CFD simulation to some extent. FEM with coarse meshing and the analytical solution are both introduced and validated as the application of the model in the 1D situation. The potential of higher-dimensional extension is emphasized so that the model has the advantages of generic, quickness, and accuracy in engineering applications. It has both practical and academic values.
We will introduce how to apply this study to engineering design step by step.
Confirm that the one-dimensional model is suitable for the cabin, decide the initial and boundary conditions, especially those at x=L.
Three types of boundary conditions have been analyzed in Section 2.3, and the corresponding analytical solutions have been given. The main task of this step is to decide which boundary condition to choose and to evaluate the constants and known functions in the equations.
Decide the gauge pressure of bursting discs @.
This parameter is so important that it directly determines the time of burst Tb, and thus determines the time to change the boundary condition at x=L.
Decide whether the expression of the analytical solution is too complicated to accept.
The analytical solutions introduced in Section 2.3 all depend on the function . If it has a very complicated expression, simplification of the solutions will be exhausting. Under this circumstance, it is advisable to use FEM introduced in Section 2.4. We recommend using coarse meshing.
Calculate
Decide whether the design is effective.
Only when @ is less than the pressure bearing capacity of civil structure @ can the design of  is decided to be effective. Otherwise@  should be adjusted. Back to step 2 to redesign.
The above-mentioned steps are summarized in Fig. 7 in convenience of application.
