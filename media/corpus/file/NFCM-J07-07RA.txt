Abstract
The major drawback of zirconia-based materials, in view of their applications as targets for minor actinide transmutation, is their poor thermal conductivity. The addition of MgO, which has high thermal conductivity, to zirconia-based materials is expected to improve their thermal conductivity. On these grounds, the present study aims at phase characterization and thermophysical property evaluation of neodymium-substituted zirconia (Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9; using Nd2O3 as a surrogate for Am2O3) and its composites with MgO. The composite was prepared by a solid-state reaction of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 (synthesized by gel combustion) and commercial MgO powders at 1773 K. Phase characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction and the microstructural investigation was performed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 increases upon composite formation with MgO, which is attributed to a higher thermal expansivity of MgO. Similarly, specific heat also increases with the addition of MgO to Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. Thermal conductivity was calculated from measured thermal diffusivity, temperature-dependent density and specific heat values. Thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt%) composite is more than that of typical UO2 fuel, supporting the potential of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composites as target materials for minor actinides transmutation.

1. Introduction
Incineration of long-lived minor actinides (MAs) in nuclear reactors and accelerator-driven sub-critical systems (ADSS) has been considered as a promising option to reduce the radio-toxicity of nuclear waste significantly [1,2]. In this direction, a uranium-free inert matrix fuel (IMF) concept has been envisaged to burn minor actinides [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Several materials, which include oxides, carbides, nitrides, alloys and even composites, have been proposed and investigated as IMF [4]. CeO2, MgO, MgAl2O4, YSZ and ZrO2 have been considered as potential candidates for oxide-based inert matrix materials [4,7]. Among these oxides, zirconia-based materials have been found to be the most promising inert matrix candidate owing to their superior properties such as chemical and radiation stability, low neutron capture cross-section, good compatibility with reactor components etc. [8].
Considering the potential of ZrO2 as a matrix component and Nd2O3 as a non-radioactive surrogate for minor actinides (namely, Am2O3 and Cm2O3), phase relations and thermophysical properties in ZrO2–Nd2O3 binary system have been thoroughly investigated [9]. The reason for choosing Nd2O3 as a surrogate of Am2O3 and Cm2O3 has been discussed in detail elsewhere [9,10]. The phase relation studies indicated structural feasibility for loading a significant amount of trivalent minor actinides (20–50 mol.%) in ZrO2 while maintaining a single-phase cubic structure. It must be mentioned that 20 mol.% Nd3+ substituted ZrO2 (Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9) forms cubic fluorite-type (F-type) phase while 50 mol.% Nd3+ substituted ZrO2 (Nd2Zr2O7) exhibits pyrochlore-type structure. Though the pyrochlore-type phase contains much higher concentration of MAs as compared to the F-type phase, it exhibited poorer radiation stability as compared to the F-type phase [[11], [12], [13]]. The investigations on thermophysical properties clearly showed poor thermal conductivity (∼1.6 Wm−1K−1) of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 sample over a wide temperature range (RT−1473 K) as compared to widely used typical oxide-based nuclear fuel such as UO2 [9]. There are other reports in the literature as well, which also show lower thermal conductivity of Nd3+ substituted ZrO2 ceramics such as Zr0.7Nd0.3O1.85 [14,15] and Nd2Zr2O7 [15,16]. Based on very close thermal conductivity of 1.5–2.0 Wm−1K−1 for all neodymium zirconates (20–50 mol.% Nd3+-substituted ZrO2) and better radiation response exhibited by F-type Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase, Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 was chosen to mimic the MAs bearing zirconia host phase in the present study.
The poor thermal conductivity is a major shortcoming of zirconia-based materials for their applications as inert matrix fuel. The use of these ceramics in reactors is expected to result in higher centreline temperature, large temperature gradients, thermal stresses, high fission gas release, low linear heat rating etc., which would adversely affect the in-pile performance of fuel matrix [6]. It is, therefore, very essential to improve the thermal conductivity of ZrO2-based ceramics for their application as IMF. One possible strategy to improve thermal conductivity is an optimum addition of a secondary phase with higher thermal conductivity. Magnesium oxide (MgO) has been proposed as one such material to improve heat transport from oxide ceramic fuels because of its higher thermal conductivity as compared to UO2 fuel [17]. Apart from high thermal conductivity, other favorable characteristics such as low neutron absorption cross-section, chemical stability, high melting point and high radiation stability of MgO justify its use in inert matrix fuels [18,19]. Although MgO is not compatible with hot water [20], which limits its use in light water reactors (LWRs), it has excellent compatibility with liquid metals, which are candidate coolant materials for fast reactors and ADSS [21]. Composites of MgO with ZrO2 have also been investigated to achieve high thermal conductivity and better hot-water corrosion resistance for their use in LWRs [17]. Similarly, MgO–Nd2Zr2O7 dual-phase inert matrix fuel has been reported to exhibit reasonable thermal conductivity of the composite matrix exploiting the high thermal conductivity of MgO [22]. Irradiation studies on MgO in MATINA and EFTTRA-T3 experiments have also indicated its satisfactory performance [23,24]. In a recent communication [11], we also reported that formation of a ceramic-ceramic composite of Nd-stabilised zirconia (Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9) with MgO enhances the radiation tolerance of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase against 120 MeV gold (Au) ion irradiation. It was also shown that the MgO phase shows better radiation tolerance out of the two phases in such composite. All these physicochemical properties of MgO are extremely relevant for its use in nuclear reactors.
The thermophysical properties of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composites have not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Investigation of these properties, namely the bulk thermal expansion, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, on Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 and its composite with MgO is the aim of the present study. It may be noted that Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite is a kind of dispersion fuel wherein the fuel fraction must be limited to 50 vol% [25]. Indeed, MgAl2O4–36 vol% UO2 composite was chosen for irradiation in the SILOE reactor [26], while MgO–40 wt% UO2, MgAl2O4–40 wt% UO2 and Al2O3–40 wt% UO2 composite has been irradiated under MATINA irradiations program [27]. On the same lines, an intermediate composition Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt% or 36 vol% Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9) was chosen for the present study. The thermophysical properties of MgO, the other end member, have also been evaluated and reported for comparison with existing literature data.
2. Experimental
ZrO(NO3)2.xH2O (Loba Chemie, purity 99.5%), Nd2O3 (Indian Rare Earths Ltd., purity 99%), and MgO (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%) were used as starting materials. Hexahydrate stoichiometry of zirconyl nitrate (x = 6) was determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis. Gel combustion synthesis was employed to synthesize the nominal composition Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. Nd2O3 and ZrO(NO3)2·6H2O were taken as the reactants and glycine was chosen as the fuel and the synthesis was carried out following the method reported elsewhere [9]. The fluffy powder produced by this route was calcined at 1073 K to remove residual carbonaceous impurities. Calcined Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 and as-received MgO were employed to prepare Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite by conventional solid-state route, wherein these powders were mixed by pestle in an agate mortar in alcohol medium for 1 h. All powders were compacted in the form of pellets and sintered at 1773 K for 24 h in a static air atmosphere. The heating, as well as the cooling rates, were maintained at 5 K/min. Physical defects like cracks or end cap were not observed in the sintered pellets.
Phase analysis of sintered samples was carried out on a powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λKα1 = 1.5406 Å and λKα2 = 1.5444 Å) radiation over two theta range from 10° to 80°. XRD patterns were analyzed by Rietveld and Le Bail refinement methods using the Fullprof program [28]. Microstructural analysis of sintered pellets was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 20 kV potential. The sample surface was coated with a thin layer of gold before recording the SEM images to avoid charging interference during the measurement. Images were recorded in both secondary electron (SE) (Everhart-Thornley detector) and backscattered electron (BSE) mode (solid-state backscattered electron detector). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, 80 mm2, silicon drift detector) was used for elemental analysis of these pellets.
Bulk thermal expansion of sintered samples was measured in a high-temperature vertical dilatometer over the temperature range from RT to 1573 K using 10 K/min heating rate under flowing argon atmosphere (20 ml/min). Dilation was monitored by the movement of push-rod attached to an LVDT transducer. Specific heat of sintered samples was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under the flow of high purity argon (50 ml/min) over the temperature range from 300 K to 1073 K at 10 K/min heating rate. Thermal diffusivity of sintered samples was measured in a laser flash apparatus, under dynamic vacuum (P < 1 × 10−5 Torr) over the temperature range from RT to 1273 K at an interval of 100 K. Further details on specific heat and thermal diffusivity measurements are provided in our recent publications [9,14].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
3.1.1. X-ray diffraction studies
Powder XRD patterns of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, MgO and their composite (50 wt%), after high-temperature sintering, are shown in Fig. 1. The nominal composition Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 was found to exhibit fluorite-type (F-type) cubic phase (Space group: Fm-3m) while MgO showed NaCl-type (rock salt) crystal structure (Space group: Fm-3m). Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite was found to form a biphasic system consisting of NaCl-type MgO and F-type Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase. Diffraction peaks corresponding to the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase shifted towards higher angles in the composite sample as compared to single-phase Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 (shown in Fig. 1). This indicated a contraction of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 lattice, plausibly due to partial incorporation of aliovalent Mg2+ ions and the concomitant creation of oxygen ion vacancies in the lattice. From the reported ionic radii of constituent cations namely, Mg2+ (0.89 Å), Zr4+ (0.84 Å) and Nd3+ (1.109 Å) in eight-fold coordination [29], the average cationic radius in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 lattice is estimated to be 0.89 Å; similar to that of Mg2+. Therefore, incorporation of Mg2+ in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 lattice is not expected to change the lattice parameter based on the sizes of host and guest cations. However, the introduction of associated oxygen ion vacancies (arising from charge balance requirement) would lead to lattice shrinkage. Details of the phases identified in different compositions and their lattice parameters, as determined by the refinement of powder diffraction patterns, are provided in Table 1. Lattice shrinkage of the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite sample, as compared to pure Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 is also evident from lattice parameter values (Table 1). On the other hand, the lattice parameter of the MgO phase in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite (4.2116 Å) is almost the same as that of pure MgO (4.2111 Å) sintered under identical conditions. This suggests that the MgO phase in the composite is present as almost pure MgO, and Zr4+ or Nd3+ incorporation in MgO lattice is not observed. Noguchi et al. [30], in their investigation on the MgO-rich region of the MgO–ZrO2 system, also observed a constant lattice parameter (∼4.211 Å) for MgO phase and attributed it to non-incorporation of ZrO2 in MgO phase. Our present results are, therefore, in line with reported ones and indicate that MgO is present as a pure phase in the composite.

The phase fraction of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 as well as MgO in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt%) composite sample was determined by Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data using Fullprof-2011 program [28]. It may be noted that the XRD pattern indicated marginal solubility of Mg2+ in the F-type Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase. The true composition of this F-type phase was estimated to be Zr0.75Nd0.19Mg0·06O1.845 according to EDS analysis (discussed later in the manuscript). Refinement was carried out using an appropriate structural model consisting of F-type Zr0.75Nd0.19Mg0·06O1.845 phase and NaCl-type MgO phase and an approximate scale parameter for these phases. Background fitting was carried out using a sixth-order polynomial function. Peak profile was modelled with the Pseudo-Voigt profile function. As-measured diffraction pattern, refined diffraction pattern and the difference plot between measured and refined patterns are shown in Fig. 2. Refinement parameters, namely Rp (8.44%), Rwp (12.7%) and goodness of fit (χ2: 1.54), indicate that reasonably good fit has been achieved. Refinement results also indicated the presence of 51 ± 1 wt % Zr0.75Nd0.19Mg0·06O1.845 phase and 49 ± 1 wt% MgO, which is in excellent agreement with expected phase composition for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt%) composite.

3.1.2. Electron microscopy studies
The representative secondary electron micrographs of sintered Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, MgO and Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite samples are shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c). All the sintered samples display a considerable fraction of open pores (the dark regions in the microstructure), which are distributed throughout the samples indicating that they are not highly dense. The BSE images indicate a single-phase microstructure for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 and MgO (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) and a two-phase microstructure for both Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite ((Fig. 3(c)) as expected. The light grey phase in Fig. 3(c) represents the MgO phase, while the bright phase corresponds to the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase. The BSE image also clearly indicates that the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase is homogeneously distributed in the MgO matrix or vice versa.

Average compositions in these samples were estimated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The average compositions do not vary from grain to grain in the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 sample, indicating a single-phase microstructure. Further, the overall composition (Zr: Nd = 0.78: 0.22, determined over an area of 2 mm × 2 mm) is in excellent agreement with the nominal compositions taken for combustion synthesis of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. To determine the solubility of Mg2+ in the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite sample, EDS was carried out in point acquisition mode. A representative BSE micrograph of the composite sample of higher magnification is shown in Fig. 3(d) for better clarity. The bright (spot-1) and dark (spot-2) phases in the micrograph correspond to Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 (Mg-doped) and pure MgO phase, respectively, as confirmed with EDS results. Elemental analysis on the bright phase indicated ∼6 atom% Mg2+ incorporation in F-type Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase. Based on EDS analysis, the composition of the F-type phase was calculated as Zr0.75Nd0.19Mg0·06O1.845, where oxygen content was arrived at considering the charge balance requirement. On the other hand, the MgO phase was found to exist as a pure phase. EDS analysis, therefore, corroborated the findings of XRD results. At this point, it may be noted that we did observe slight solubility (2–3 atom%) of Zr4+ in MgO in our earlier paper [11] using EDS analysis. Serena et al. [31] also reported feeble solubility of ZrO2 in MgO based on results obtained using electron probe micro-analysis coupled with X-ray spectrometry (EPMA-WDS). The very low solubility of ZrO2 in MgO has been reported by a few other groups as well [32,33]. However, the EDS analysis of the present samples did not indicate the presence of Zr/Nd in the MgO phase. The discrepancy in results may be due to the gold coating of samples, which has overlapping peaks with Zr, particularly when the concentration of Zr is low.
3.2. Thermophysical property measurements
Understanding of thermophysical behaviour is an essential requirement to qualify a material envisaged for nuclear reactor applications. With this objective, high temperature linear thermal expansion, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, MgO and their composite (50 wt%) were evaluated. All measurements were carried out on sintered samples having a geometrical density of more than 80% of theoretical density (TD) (Table 2). These results are presented in the following section:
Table 2. Dimensions, density and fractional porosity of sintered pellets employed for different studies. The standard deviation has been given in parenthesis.
3.2.1. Thermal expansion studies
Accurate measurement of thermal expansivitiy of nuclear fuel materials is required to estimate the extent of swelling under thermal stress in order to optimize the fuel-clad gap and avoid fuel clad mechanical interactions (FCMI). Percentage linear thermal expansion () of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite and MgO over 423 K–1573 K is plotted in Fig. 4. Experimentally determined results were fitted into second order polynomial functions and the following equations were obtained:

The average linear thermal expansion coefficient (αL) is defined as

Where Lo is the length of the specimen at To, ΔL is the change in length and ΔT is the change in temperature. Values of ‘αL’ for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite and MgO (as evaluated from equation-4) are 11.5 × 10−6/K, 13.4 × 10−6/K and 15.1 × 10−6/K, respectively, over the temperature range from RT to 1573 K. Thermal expansion of MgO has been investigated independently by many researchers by employing dilatometry [34,35], high-temperature X-ray diffraction [36,37] as well as theoretical studies [38]. Nielsen et al. [34] reported αL = 15.2 × 10−6/K to 15.4 × 10−6/K for MgO over the temperature range from 298 K to 1473 K. Suzuki et al. [35] observed a higher expansion coefficient of 16.8 × 10−6/K at 1573 K for highly pure MgO single crystal (>99.9% TD) and 15.9 × 10−6/K at the same temperature for a low-density synthetic sample (>92.4% TD) and highlighted the dependence of bulk thermal expansion coefficient on sample density. It may be noted here that the density of MgO sample used in the present study is further lower (∼2.97 g/cc; > 82.9% TD), and therefore, the observed average thermal expansion coefficient (15.1 × 10−6/K) is in line with the density dependence trend of the same. Dubrovinsky et al. [36] reported molar volume of MgO as 11.2434 cm3 and 11.9081 cm3 at 298 K and 1598 K, respectively, using in situ HT-XRD studies. Using these data, the lattice thermal expansion coefficient of MgO over the temperature range from 298 K to 1598 K was evaluated to be 14.9 × 10−6/K. Fiquet et al. [37] also reported an expansion coefficient for MgO (15.6 × 10−6/K) based on the measured molar volume of 11.227 cm3 and 11.903 cm3 at 298 K and 1557 K, respectively. A similar value of thermal expansion coefficient (15.6 × 10−6/K) for MgO has been reported by Rao et al. [39] over 300 K–1250 K. On the other hand, using computational tools, Reeber et al. [38] calculated a higher expansion coefficient (16.8 × 10−6/K) over the temperature range from 300 K to 1500 K. Results obtained on MgO in the present investigation are well compared to above-cited literature information and therefore validates the acceptability of our results on pure MgO. Similar to MgO, literature information is available for the thermal expansion behavior of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. Liu et al. [15] have reported a linear bulk thermal expansion coefficient for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 (∼11.5 × 10−6/K) over the temperature range from 300 K to 1573 K, which matches well with present results. It can be seen that the addition of 50 wt% MgO to Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 to form Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite leads to an increase in average linear thermal expansion coefficient from 11.5 × 10−6/K (for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9) to 13.4 × 10−6/K (for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite). This increase is attributed to higher thermal expansivity of MgO as compared to that of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. The thermal expansion coefficient for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO (50 wt% or 63.58 vol% MgO) composite was estimated to be 13.8 × 10−6/K employing the rule of mixture using the following equation [40]:
αComposite = αMgO × VMgO + αZrNdO × V ZrNdO
where αComposite, αMgO and αZrNdO are the thermal expansion coefficients of composite, pure MgO and Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, respectively; and VMgO and VZrNdO are the volume fractions of pure MgO and Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, respectively. It was found that the experimentally determined thermal expansion coefficient is approximately 3% lower as compared to that determined by the rule of mixture, which does not consider any interaction the constituent phases. The authors, therefore, speculate that the homogeneous distribution of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 grains restrain the expansion of MgO grains in composite to some extent. Literature also indicates an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient upon the addition of MgO to neodymium zirconates [22]. Linear thermal expansion data has also been used to evaluate the temperature-dependent density of samples, which is required for the calculation of thermal conductivity. This has been discussed later in this manuscript.
3.2.2. Specific heat capacity studies
The main objective of calorimetric studies was to measure the mean specific heat capacity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite (50 wt%) and pure MgO. Specific heat measurements were repeated three times and the mean value of measurements at each temperature was taken as the average specific heat. The standard deviation was found to be within ± 2%. Experimentally measured specific heat capacities of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, MgO and their composite (50 wt %) are shown in Fig. 5. Specific heat data for MgO taken from Barin et al. [41] is also included for comparison. These results show that the measured specific heat of MgO is in excellent agreement (within ± 1%) with the literature values over the temperature range from 400 K to 1073 K [41,42]. MgO has the highest specific heat while Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 exhibits the lowest specific heat. Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite shows intermediate values between the two constituents. Specific heat for the composite sample has also been estimated based on the experimentally determined specific heat of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 and MgO employing Neumann-Kopp’s rule (weighted fractional sum of specific heats of components). Results show a very good match (within ± 3%) between estimated and measured values for the composite sample. Therefore, in the absence of experimental heat capacity data of various compositions in the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO system, estimated data using Neumann–Kopp rule may closely represent the true heat capacity of these composites. For all samples, specific heat increases with increasing temperature and does not exhibit any anomaly, thereby ruling out any phase transition over the investigated temperature range. Experimentally measured specific heat data was fit into A + BT + CT−2 polynomial where A, B, and C are polynomial coefficients, and T is the absolute temperature. The values of these coefficients are given in Table 3. Specific heat capacity data has been used for the evaluation of thermal conductivity, which is discussed in the next section.

3.2.3. Thermal diffusivity and conductivity studies
Information on the thermal conductivity of materials envisaged to be used in nuclear reactors is of great importance. In the present investigation, thermal conductivities of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, its composite with 50 wt% MgO and pure MgO have been reported over the temperature range from RT to 1273 K. Thermal conductivity (λ(T)) was calculated from thermal diffusivity (D(T)), specific heat capacity (CP(T)) and temperature-dependent density (ρ(T)) data using equation (5).
(5)λ(T) = D(T) × Cp(T) × ρ(T)
Variation in the as-measured thermal diffusivity of all three samples as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 6. Thermal diffusivity value at each temperature has been obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of three different measurements. The relative standard deviation was found to be < ± 3% based on these measurements. It was observed that the addition of MgO to Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 leads to an increase in thermal diffusivity, as shown by diffusivity results of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9−MgO composite. MgO shows the highest thermal diffusivity among all the three studied samples. Thermal diffusivity of MgO measured by Luo et al. [43] using the laser flash technique has also been incorporated in Fig. 6 for comparison. While the trend in diffusivity variation with temperature is similar in both cases, values reported by Luo et al. [43] are slightly higher than our results, which can be attributed to a higher density of MgO sample used by them (∼93% TD) as compared to our sample (∼79% TD). It was observed that thermal diffusivity data follow the inverse temperature dependence behaviour for all three samples, which indicates dominant phonon conduction behaviour; most common for insulating ceramics in the studied temperature range. It may be noted that the temperature dependence of diffusivity is less pronounced in the case of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. Temperature-dependent density ‘ρ(T)’ was calculated from room temperature density and linear thermal expansion data. Here it must be mentioned that the uncertainty in the geometrical density of samples is approximately 3%. Further, an uncertainty of 2% in the thermal expansion data does not significantly influence the uncertainty in temperature-dependent volume and hence temperature-dependent density. Therefore, the uncertainty in temperature-dependent density is approximately 3%. The specific heat data required for the evaluation of thermal conductivity was calculated using specific heat equations given in Table 3. Estimated thermal conductivity decreased with increasing temperature except for Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, where it showed nearly temperature-independent behaviour. The uncertainty in thermal diffusivity and specific heat values are 3% and 2%, respectively, as stated earlier. Therefore, the uncertainty of thermal conductivity values was estimated to be approximately 5% following the rule of propagation of uncertainties. Since the samples used for measurements were not fully dense, porosity correction was applied to the evaluated thermal conductivity data (λm) to arrive at the conductivity values of fully dense (100% TD) compositions (λ100). Porosity correction was carried out using the following relation, which has widely been used for similar ceramics [15,44]:

Porosity corrected thermal conductivities of all studied samples as functions of temperature are shown in Fig. 7. Similar to thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity also decreases with increasing temperature. These results also show that Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 has very low thermal conductivity (∼1.5 Wm−1K−1 (RT−1473 K)) and is weakly dependent on temperature [9,15]. Low thermal conductivity of Nd-substituted zirconia reported by many researchers [9,14,15,44], has been attributed to (i) large differences in mass and size between Zr4+ and Nd3+ ions, (ii) presence of oxygen ion vacancies and (iii) extensive structural disorder. On the contrary, MgO exhibits the highest thermal conductivity among all three samples studied here. For comparison, literature reported thermal conductivity values of MgO [43,45,46] are plotted along with results obtained in the present investigation. Slifka et al. [45] and Luo et al. [43] have reported thermal conductivity of the MgO sample having 93% and 98% theoretical density (TD), respectively, over the temperature range from 400 K to 1300 K. These values were normalized for fully dense specimens (100% TD; equation (6)) before plotting in Fig. 7. Results obtained on MgO in the present investigation were also compared with recommended conductivity values [46]. From Fig. 7, it is clear that the results obtained in this study are in good agreement with both literature reports as well as recommended values for MgO. It was also observed that the thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 increases upon MgO addition. To be more precise, the thermal conductivity of the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 sample at room temperature increases from ∼1.5 Wm−1K−1 to ∼14 Wm−1K−1 upon 50 wt% addition of a highly thermally conductive MgO (46 Wm−1K−1 at RT) phase. The increase in thermal conductivity by approximately nine times ( × 9) in Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt%) composite as compared to phase pure Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 may be ascribed to percolation theory [47]. According to this theory, a composite system composed of randomly mixed thermally more conductive and insulator phases exhibits a significant increase in thermal conductivity when the volume fraction of the highly conductive component is higher than a critical concentration, which is known as percolation threshold [48,49]. The higher is the thermal conductivity of the conductive component, higher will be the effective conductivity of the composite. In the present scenario, MgO (conductive component) exists as an almost pure phase and is advantageous for their applications in inert matrix fuel. To elaborate, if there is a considerable solubility of Zr4+ or Nd3+ in MgO, lots of lattice defects will be generated. These defects will act as phonon scattering centers. This would lead to decrease in thermal conductivity of MgO and consequently the composite. The decrease in thermal conductivity in substituted MgO has been confirmed by Kim et al. [50], who have reported thermal conductivity of 10 and 30 mol% Zn doped MgO, which is just 8.14 Wm−1K−1 and 4.79 Wm−1K−1, respectively, at room temperature. An increase in thermal conductivity has been reported in ZrO2–MgO and Er-substituted ZrO2–MgO system upon successive MgO addition [17]. More importantly, the thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite is sufficiently higher (∼14 Wm−1K−1 at RT, ∼10.4 Wm−1K−1 at 473 K and ∼4.6 Wm−1K−1 at 1273 K) than that of a highly dense UO2 (∼8.7 Wm−1K−1 at RT, ∼6.8 Wm−1K−1 at 473 K and ∼3.1 Wm−1K−1 at 1273 K) sample [51], which is industrially used conventional ceramic oxide nuclear fuel worldwide.

Error bars represent one standard deviation (1σ) and are omitted where comparable or smaller to symbol size. Literature reported thermal conductivities of MgO [43,45,46] are also plotted along for comparison.
Present results of thermophysical properties clearly demonstrate high thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite (50 wt%) as compared to zirconia-based materials and make it a potential inert matrix fuel candidate for future reactor systems; particularly envisaged for minor actinide transmutation purpose.
4. Conclusion
Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 was synthesized via the gel combustion route and Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composite was prepared by a solid-state reaction of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 and commercially available MgO powders. Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9, MgO and their composite (50 wt%) were thoroughly phase characterized by XRD. The marginal solubility of Mg2+ in the Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 phase and existence of a pure MgO in the composite was confirmed by XRD in conjunction with EDS analysis. Reasonable open porosity was observed in the microstructure, which indicates the samples were not highly dense. The thermophysical properties of composite as well as the end members were investigated. The thermal expansion coefficient of the composite (13.4 × 10−6/K) was observed to be intermediate between that of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 (11.5 × 10−6/K) and MgO (15.1 × 10−6/K). Specific heat capacity as a function of temperature has been evaluated for all three samples, which indicated an increase in specific heat with the addition of MgO to Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9. The highlight of the study is the significant enhancement of the thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9 by the addition of MgO as a secondary phase. Measured thermal conductivity of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO (50 wt%) composite is more than that of conventional high density typical UO2 fuel, thus justifying the potential of Zr0.8Nd0.2O1.9–MgO composites as inert matrix fuel for minor actinides transmutation.
