<Section>Abstract</Section>
This study highlights Integral Molten Salt Reactors and models a beginning-of-life Integral (core assembly and primary loop components inside the core vessel) Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) in Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) particle transport code and compares fundamental neutronic and thermal performance characteristics against known MSRs such as the ORNL MSRE and FUJI-MSR. Evaluations of core fast and thermal neutron flux, basic thermal performance, and core lifetime will be compared to known performance benchmarks. This study utilizes the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) High Performance Computing (HPC) facility, including the Falcon 2 SGI ICE-X distributed memory system with 34,992 cores to complete the necessary computations. This study will inform follow-on work on the IMSR molten salt and fuel cycle alternatives. Conceptual designs evaluated in this study preserve the inherent safety and economic benefits associated with proliferation risk and safeguards in reactor control, cooling, and containment. Recommendations for further study include conducting fuel burnup analysis using Serpent code, completing a parametric analysis on fuel cycle performance, and coupling INL’s MOOSE object oriented applications to predict steady state and time-dependent neutronics, thermal-fluids, and fuel material performance in MSRs.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Molten salt reactors (MSRs) were first developed over a half a century ago. With the advent of new materials, fabrication methods, and analysis tools there has been increasing interest in this type of reactor around the globe. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was initiated by the US Department of Energy in 2000 and formally chartered in mid-2001. It is an international collective representing governments of 13 countries where nuclear energy is significant now and also seen as vital for the future (World Nuclear Association, 2019). MSRs are considered among the Generation IV reactor concepts due to their potential to realize non-proliferation, manageable waste stream, and sustainable global energy needs around the globe. New ideas are being pursued that were once thought to be intractable. For instance, the improving availability of high-end computing resources and development of robust numerical multi-physics computational methods and applications have made design, evaluation, and demonstration of advanced nuclear concepts and engineering designs more achievable than ever before. Concepts and designs can be modeled, analyzed and evaluated long before resources are allocated for more costly prototypic demonstrations. The Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) has multiple advantages over current Generation III designs including potentially lower capital costs, higher overall safety, and resource sustainability (World Nuclear Association, 2019, LeBlanc et al., 2018).
The IMSR design uses a molten salt fuel at low pressure and high temperature within a thermalized neutron spectrum reactor. The design consists of self-contained primary system within a single structural vessel. As Fig. 1 shows, the heat source, heat sink, primary pumps, and heat exchangers are all contained within a single integral reactor vessel. This allows for single use and disposal of low enriched fissile fuel with the potential for self-burning long-lived actinides during reactor operations. The potential exists for future IMSR designs to optimize core physics, fuel salts, and innovative fuel cycle management options that have significant opportunities to reduce fuel loading to fractions of current Light Water Reactors (LWR) which may also reduce the Pu and Transuranic (TRU) waste products. This study aims to model the IMSR in MCNP based on commercially available Terrestrial Energy IMSR design data. While the author realizes that the MCNP code is not a validation standard for MSR application, results will help inform a future broader study of new and innovative molten salt fuels (such as using spent LWR fuel) and fuel cycles that improve the waste profile (waste burnup).

MSRs use eutectic mixtures of fissile and fertile fluorides (uranium, thorium, plutonium) with other carrier salts such as Lithium, Beryllium, or Sodium flourides. Although fast molten salt designs have been pursued, thermalizing the neutron spectrum with graphite for instance has many advantages. Thermal spectrum MSRs provide improved reactor control, reduced detrimental neutron displacement per atom (dpa) material effects, and a reduced starting fissile inventory. Additionally, using carbon/graphite throughout the core permits over-moderating the outer zone which acts as a net absorber of neutrons and helps protect the reactor vessel wall from damaging neutron exposure. Zoning moderator radially to reduce thermal neutron density (fission density at core center) while enhancing thermal neutron density in the outer region to increase fission density at edges helps level power distribution and fission heating of the fuel salt rising in the core. This potentially helps promote more stable thermal hydraulic flow of the fuel salt. The reactor vessel and structural components have typically been proposed as being made of a high nickel alloy such as
®
N; however, new corrosion resistant materials are possible (McCoy et al., 2017).
MCNP stochastic particle transport code was used to evaluate core physics and nuclear heating phenomenology in the IMSR (Holden, 2018, Lucas, 2010, Brewer, 2019, Boston, 2014). To the maximum extent possible, the Terrestrial Energy IMSR was modeled using commercially available reactor design information (LeBlanc et al., 2018, LeBlanc, 2018, Dolan, 2017). Neutronic results were compared against nominal MSR performance established in the 1960s during Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) operation of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) (Robertson, 1965). One notable difference in structural design is the model uses
®
for primary and vessel structures and Oak Ridge studied 316 and 304 stainless steel. TEI has also mentioned publicly that stainless alloys as a preferred material due to code case development.
1.1. Motivation
This study was motivated by collaborative discussions between the author and Dr. David LaBlanc, Chief Technology Officer at Terrestrial Energy, Inc. The author agreed to study the effects of alternative molten salts on fuel cycle and waste stream management as it pertains to the Terrestrial Energy IMSR design. This paper is the first in a series of papers intended to develop the models and tools needed to fully evaluate the areas of interest.
1.2. Study goals
This study aims to provide an overview of Integral Molten Salt Reactors and develop a nominal IMSR design that provides acceptable neutron physics for further fuel cycle and waste stream study. The IMSR design modeled in this study is a beginning-of-life (plutonium free, fission product poison free), carbon thermalized, 93% enriched uranium at 0.15 mol%  in salt solution, FLiBe (66.85 mol% LiF – 33 mol%  – 0.15 mol% ) based fuel salt. Lithium is purified to 99.992 mol% lithium-7 to mimimize the consequences of tritium generation. Physics and thermal results using MCNP 6.2 are compared with nominal MSRE and other MSR designs such as FUJI-MSR (Boston, 2014). This study will show the model results in acceptable physics that is consistent with other real and postulated designs. Specific physics, mechanical, and thermal performance results are presented and compared to other design benchmarks to show that the modeled design represents a physically credible IMSR design. This work also provides specific recommendations for further study. Foremost, the author intends to use the core design presented in this study to conduct fuel burn-up evaluations using alternative carrier salts using Serpent 2 codes (Leppänen et al., 2013) in future studies. The intent of follow-on work is to improve understanding about how alternative carrier salts affect waste stream source term and radiotoxicity.
<Section>2. Integral MSR model development</Section>
Open source Terrestrial Energy, Inc (TEI) IMSR design parameters were obtained to help inform several aspects of the model in this study (Holden, 2018, Lucas, 2010, Brewer, 2019, Boston, 2014). Some performance parameters of the design were not available through open source and therefore conservative engineering assumptions were made to complete the nominal design. The modeled design includes an inlet and outlet fuel plenum, a rudimentary heat exchanger, reflectors, fuel downcomer region all contained within an integral reactor vessel. It is assumed that the TEI design has a hexagonal fuel lattice similar to the FUJI-MSR design (Banoori et al., 2016). In addition, it is assumed that material for structures such as reactor vessel, cladding, and reflector components are composed of
®
. Specific form factor dimensions were not fully available open source so assumptions were made to achieve suitable neutronic fundamental mode eigenvalues. Although not fully utilized in this study, the model can easily accommodate instrumentation assemblies. Fig. 2, Fig. 3 show the layout and are explained in further detail below.
Fig. 2. IMSR model top view. Fuel assemblies consist of three regions zoned by fuel/moderator ratio to aid in leveling neutron radial flux in the core. The white assembly centers are control rods and the upper light blue assemblies are carbon reflector cells. The core consists of a 21 by 21 hexagonal lattice with an average 15 vol.% molten salt fuel to 85 vol.% carbon ratio.
Fig. 3. IMSR model side view. Using a similar color scheme to Fig. 1, fuel flows up the carbon hexagon assemblies to enhance natural circulation characteristics, through the upper reflector (yellow) and into an outlet plenum (green). Fuel mixes in the outlet plenum and flows down the downcomer region (light blue) and mixes again in the inlet plenum (dark blue). TEI’s IMSR design allows for either clockwise or counterclockwise core flow.
Baseline IMSR design parameters including determination of core physical dimensions, basic core thermal-hydraulic constituents, basic core layout, core fuel/moderator/reflector materials, and core control materials were determined by completing a comprehensive literature review. Although detailed design information on the specific TEI IMSR core was scarce, information on the Terrestrial Energy website and publicly released reports of TEI’s patent submission were available and used extensively in this study. The general TEI IMSR design was obtained online at the US Patent Office (LeBlanc, 2018). The lack of specific and detailed TEI design information was mitigated by leveraging use of ORNL MSRE and FUJI MSR core design concepts (Dolan, 2017, Robertson, 1965, Haubenreich et al., 1964, Banoori et al., 2016, Greaves et al., 2012, Robertson, 1965). For instance, fuel and moderator and structural composition and physical dimensions were extrapolated from MSRE and FUJI designs, where appropriate. Key reactor core design features included fuel, moderator, reflector structures, core materials, fuel inlet and outlet, and downcomer flow plenums. Core materials include a stainless steel reflector,
®
core basket and reactor vessel and plenum structures. ENDF70 B-VII.1 and thermal  cross section libraries of molten salt fuel and moderator isotopic compositions were used for a  K operating core.
All MCNP tally and eigenvalue entropy checks passed statistical checks. Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL) High Performance Computing (HPC) Falcon 2 was used to complete this study over 500,000 particles per cycle and 300 cycles per computational run. Falcon is a SGI ICE-X distributed memory system with 34,992 cores and a LINPACK rating of 1 Petaflop/s. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) High Performance Computing (HPC) facility provides high-end computing capability to support this and follow-on studies (Department of Energy and Idaho National Laboratory, 2020).
The IMSR modeled in this study has a similar form factor to the Terrestrial Energy, Inc IMSR. As shown in the Fig. 2, Fig. 3, fuel assemblies are zoned into three regions. The fuel channels are zoned to a nominal 85 vol.% carbon moderator and 15 vol.% molten salt fuel (83.6 wt.% carbon – 16.4 wt.% fuel salt) which results in a nominal carbon-to-fuel salt ratio of about 5.1. This equates to about one uranium-235 atom per 890 carbon atoms in the active core region. Region I fuel channels are zoned with 10% more carbon and less fuel while region III fuel channel are zoned with 10% less carbon and more fuel. An carbon density of 1.84  at 300 K and a fuel salt density of 2.05  at 773 K (nominal melting point) was used in the model. This overall moderator zoning scheme results in an overall flattened neutron flux distribution. Specifically, the average region I-to-region III thermal neutron flux ratio is approximately 1.51. Over 97% of all fissions occur due to thermalized neutrons. The nuclear heat rate (power density) in region I, region II, and region III is 19.5 MW (0.52 MW/l), 212.9 MW (5.4 MW/l), and 127.8 MW (2.7 MW/l), respectively (see Fig. 2). The molten salt fuel flows upward through the flow metering channels into the outlet plenum at the top of the core. The salt then flows down the downcomer region into the inlet plenum. Structural components such as pumps, and heat exchangers are located above the reflected outlet plenum region of the core do not play a significant role in core neutronics and are therefore not modeled in detail in this study.
The core has six control rod assemblies which by MCNP results provide 10% shutdown margin and sufficient reactivity control to ensure critical operations throughout a projected core lifetime (5–7 years). In addition, the core has approximately 6% excess reactivity with rods fully withdrawn from the core. This excess allows for anticipated fuel burn-up over core life without the need for in-line fuel processing as some non-integral MSR designs are challenged to achieve estimated 30 year operating lifetimes (McCoy et al., 2017, LeBlanc, 2016). Control rods are composed of enriched Gadolinium () to about 55%. Critical control rod height is about 135 cm above the bottom of the core (65 cm below waist center line and 34% above core bottom). Non-Integral MSR concepts such as the MSRE had very small excess reactivity due to an in-line fuel reprocessing capability. MSRs are designed with very small excess reactivity ( 0.01) due to the ability to conduct in-process refueling. The IMSR has a slightly larger amount of excess reactivity at Beginning-of-Life (BOL) to permit critical core operations at End-of-Life (EOL) without the need for in-line reprocessing. Low excess reactivity is an advantage from a safety accident consequence perspective. The IMSR is unique in its design because it is an integral unit that does not refuel or have in-process refueling capability. This potentially allows end-of-life disposal or recapture (5–7 years) in a cost effective manner. As a result, the excess reactivity of the IMSR core is larger than a MSR with in-process refueling. The IMSR modeled in this design has approximately 6% excess reactivity and can be easily adjusted with changes to fuel core volume and molten salt weight percent loading.
As seen in Fig. 2, the core has a carbon reflector region outside of the region III fuel assemblies. The reflector is indicated in light blue. Structural components are
®
N or Stainless Steel with
®
N cladding (Lindsay, 2018).
®
N has been shown to have effective corrosion resistance in molten salt environments throughout the 5–7 year design operating lifetime. Neutron flux profiles across the core indicate the reflector region is effective at minimizing fission heating of fuel in the downcomer region and also effective at reducing neutron fluence at the reactor vessel. In addition, reflector regions at the top of the core are effectively reduce neutron fluence to structures while enhancing neutronics in the core. Both of these features will promote vessel and structural integrity throughout the useful operating life of the core.
ENDF70 B-VII.1 cross section libraries representative of an operating temperature of C and appropriate S() thermal libraries were also utilized for moderator and fuel constituents. The hexagonal fuel and moderator assemblies have a pitch of 26.152 cm in a 21 by 21 hexagonal lattice. The core radius is 1.95 meters with an effective core height of 4.15 meters. A total core heating rate of about 400 MW resulted in an average thermal neutron flux of  n/-s. This thermal output equates to an average power density of about 2.9 MW/liter molten salt in the active core neglecting contributions from the plenum and downcomer. This result corresponds well to MSRE and FUJI-MSR design and operating parameters.
<Section>3. Thermal, material, and neutronic performance</Section>
With control rods partially inserted, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 illustrate the radial thermal neutron distribution in the core at =1.01. The average neutron energy causing a fission is 635.3 eV and the energy corresponding to the average neutron lethargy causing fission is 0.0597 eV. The percentages of fissions caused by neutrons in the thermal region ( 0.625 eV) is 97.15%. MCNP normalizes flux tallies per source neutron. Conversions based on operating core power (fissions per second) must be completed to derive meaningful physical core properties. Straight forward calculations shown below are required to convert the MCNP flux tallies to neutrons per square cm-seconds by multiplying by the number of source neutrons per second in the core operating at a given power level. Notice the flux scale shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 6 is logarithmic and spans eight orders of magnitude. As expected, the radial flux distribution is azimuthally symmetric and indicates strong attenuation in non-thermalized and rod poisoned regions. An additional advantage of the IMSR design is the lack of fission product buildup (which can be vented at the top of the integral vessel) (LeBlanc, 2018). By contrast, solid fueled reactors are constrained by fission product buildup in fuel structures over core life. This becomes problematic for waste disposal, limits EOL core performance from a thermal hydraulic perspective, and requires burnable poisons and zoned fuels to be loaded at BOL to compensate for fuel burn throughout core life. Conversely, MSRs can operate for sustained periods with lower fission product poison buildup and therefore can operate throughout core life with a lower fuel enrichment.
Fig. 4. IMSR 2D radial flux distribution (flux normalized per source neutron) at control rod tips run on Falcon 2 and displayed using MCNP/Xming. The figure spans eight orders of flux magnitude normalized to flux per source neutron. The flux has azimuthal symmetry and the effect of the control rods and reflector regions are clearly visible. Flux is suppressed three orders of magnitude in these regions.

Fig. 6. Two Xming IMSR 2D axial flux distribution plots (normalized per source neutron) run on HPC Falcon 2. The figure shows reflector effectiveness, inlet and outlet plenum neutron flux, and control rod shadowing phenomenology. Notice the control rod channel neutron self-shadowing low in the core.
The MCNP flux and energy tallies have units of neutrons/ per source (fission) neutron and MeV/ per source (fission) neutron, respectively. To obtain the number of neutrons passing through a surface area per unit time  and heat generated per gram of material, the tallies result must be multiplied by a neutron flux conversion factor and heat normalization factor using core power (user provided) and 2.437 neutrons per fission, 180.88 MeV per fission (MCNP provided). Actual flux values and the heat generation rates are calculated using MCNP flux and energy deposition tally results.
As shown in Fig. 6, the axial flux distribution is symmetric about the core vertical centerline and is biased low in the core below the control rod height. The inlet plenum is not as well reflected as the outlet plenum and as a result more fission heating occurs in the inlet plenum low in the core. This design helps minimize the neutron fluence to structural components (pumps, heat exchangers, and rod drive assemblies) high in the core. Fig. 7(a) illustrate the radial cross section of the core waistline flux distribution and Fig. 7(b) shows the axial neutron flux with controls inserted to a position of 65 cm below core waistline. The neutron flux is symmetrically distributed and show the effective reduction of flux in the rod poisoned regions.
Fig. 7. MCNP Neutron Flux distributions plotted at the control rod tips show significant flux reduction at the control rods. Control rod position z = −65 cm. Nuclear power generation occurs predominately below the height of the control rods in the core.
Fig. 8(a) illustrates the thermal neutron flux in the fuel as a function of energy. These results were obtained by binning MCNP tallies (flux and energy/mass) results into the desired energy bins. In this core, in excess of 95% of fissions are caused by thermal neutrons. The flux spectrums shown in Fig. 8 are not representative of the average flux in the core since these results were taken near core center and above control rod height. For the nominal 423 MW core, averaged thermal flux over the core is  n/-s. The average fast flux (0.1 MeV) over the core is approximately  n/-s. This high degree of thermalization helps mitigate graphite strain effects that may contribute to limiting core life. Review of Fig. 8(b) shows the fast neutron (>0.2 MeV) flux in the moderator. It is important to characterize fast flux in a graphite moderated core due to graphite’s shrink and swell when exposed to high energy neutron fluence. Graphite swell under a fast neutron fluence is a key engineering limitation when determining core lifetime in graphite moderated reactors.

Natural circulation of the molten salt in the event of a pump failure is a central safety feature in Generation IV cores. In order to enhance passive cooling (natural circulation), the thermal center of the heat sink (heat exchanger) is higher than the thermal center of the heat source (reactor) and minimal heating occurs in the downcomer region of the reactor. MCNP neutron and gamma energy/mass tallies provide energy deposition for each core material volume. MCNP normalizes energy/mass tallies per source (fission) neutron. For a 400 MW thermal core, renormalization of the energy/mass tally yields the energy deposited into each of the structural and fuel volumes. The fission and gamma heating rates for fuel salt downcomer, plenums, non-core structures, and auxiliaries is shown in Table 1. Notably, the majority of heating occurs in the inlet plenum (low in the core). This provides for a low thermal center for the heat source which is ideal for promoting natural circulation flow in the event of loss of pumping action. Less than 9% of heating occurs in non-core structures.
Table 1. Fission/ Heat Rates.
The downcomer fuel region is effectively shielded from a neutron flux that would result in significant fission heating. Only 0.6% of core thermal output is generated in the downcomer region. This enables a greater thermal driving head in the downcomer region which enhances natural circulation flow in the event of integral primary pump failure. Additionally, 9.8% of the fission and gamma heating occurs in the inlet plenum which also enhances passive molten salt flow in the core. MCNP calculates mass in each user designed cell (volume) using user provided density and calculated or user provided volume. Using a molten salt density of 2.05 g/ and MCNP calculated cell volumes, the fuel mass contained within the core can be calculated. In a fission product poison free core, the total core mass (fuel, moderator, control rods, cladding) of 3.0 metric tons (this includes 278.5 kg of molten salt or about 0.42 kg of  at 0.15% salt molar concentration in the core excluding downcomer and plenum regions). These mass calculations were independently verified by hand. Build up of fission product poisons and higher actinides such as plutonium and neptunium may significantly change core physics.
<Section>4. Comparative analysis to MSRE and FUJI-MSR</Section>
It is important to compare the modeled IMSR thermal and neutronic performance against established nominal MSRE and FUJI-MSR parameters (Yoshioka and Mitachi, 2010, International Thorium Molten-Salt Forum, 2016, Krepel, 2014). Table 2 outlines a comparison of MSRs and the modeled IMSR. Examination shows that the modeled IMSR is representative of TEI’s IMSR and scalable to similar MSR designs of MSRE and FUJI-MSR.
Table 2. MSR Comparison.
Average power density. Accounts for full fuel salt heat generation (plenum + downcomer + core). Peak power density occurs in Region II at 5.4 MW/l.
The modeled IMSR form factor in terms of size, volume, fuel loading, and weight are commensurate with previous operational designs or in-line with design under development. Core thermal power values similar to TEI IMSR design values result in similar core power density for thermal neutron flux values. In contrast to this studies modeled design, the TEI design is intended to operate with control rods fully withdrawn to avoid unwanted issues associated with rod withdrawal accidents. The results of this study show uniform radial neutron distributions and axial neutron flux distributions in line with expected flux shapes for radially fuel zoned cores with absorbing control rods near core mid-waistline. The modeled core also has expected excess reactivity of 6% with control rods fully withdrawn and demonstrates a shutdown reactivity () with the six control rods fully inserted. Model neutronics yield a thermal spectrum using a 5.7 (85/15) moderator-to-molten salt fuel ratio. This equals about 890 carbon atoms per uranium-235 atom in the active core. These factors taken in sum build confidence that this model produces results expected of a operational reactor is usable for further modeling and simulation study.
For a given fuel loading, form factor, thermal neutron flux, and operating temperature; this evaluation shows the model has a neutron flux, power density, and core lifetime comparable to MSRE and FUJI-MSR. This is encouraging and motivates the notion that the model can be used to yield useful results to study fuel burn and fuel cycle alternatives.
<Section>5. Future work</Section>
MSR modeling has been conducted by various organizations using various particle transport and fuel burn-up codes (Aufiero et al., 2013, Aufiero et al., 2013, Aufiero et al., 2014, Bauman et al., 1971, Betzler et al., 2017, Brown, 2016, Cammi, 2011, Cammi et al., 2012, Cheng and Dai, 2014, Diamond et al., 2018, Engel et al., 1980, Engel and Prince, 1967, Fiorina et al., 2013, Fiorina et al., 2014, Haag, 2005, Haubenreich and Engel, 1970, Kópházi et al., 2009, Krepel et al., 2007, Sheu et al., 2013, Shi et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2016, Taube, 1974, Xu et al., 2002, Yoshioka and Mitachi, 2010, Zhou et al., 2015, Greaves et al., 2012, Department of Energy and Idaho National Laboratory, 2020, LeBlanc, 2016, Giraud and Parry, 2019, International Thorium Molten-Salt Forum, 2016, Krepel, 2014, Lindsay, 2018, Betzler et al., 2018, Betzler et al., 2018, Rahnema et al., 2017, An Evaluation of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor, 1972, Betzler et al., 2017, Rahnema et al., 2017, Ball and Kerlin, 1965, Kerlin and Ball, 1966, Haubenreich, 1962, He, 2016, Bowman, 2011, Heuer et al., 2010, Powers et al., 2013). Most of this previous work is not related to the IMSR integral design and a full multi-physics evaluation of the IMSR might be considered fertile ground for further study. Detailed use of Serpent to examine fuel burnup behavior and robust multi-physics modeling to examine fluid neutronic hydrodynamic behavior, especially with in the addition of the advective term is new work and might lead to new understanding of MSR steady state and transient performance in normal and unusual operating modes.
Previous work includes MSR computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling using FLUENT, thermal-hydraulic modeling using RELAP5, and multi-physics modeling using SAM (NEAMS), DYN3D-MSR, TRACE, MOLTRES, and COMSOL. Several of these studies acknowledge that further optimization is required to yield full modeling maturity and qualification to inform safety studies.
Specific recommended work to this follow study might include:
•
Incorporate this model into Serpent and complete fuel burnup studies on FLiBe and other viable alternative molten salt fuels. Williams et al. (2006) provides a helpful examination of candidate molten salt fuels. Analysis of optimum fuel cycle/waste stream concepts based on variance in modeling parameters, e.g. start-up fuel composition/loading, core design, fuel reuse schemes merits additional work. Improved understanding of the viability of non-lithium (mitigate need for highly enriched  and tritium handling schemes) and non-beryllium (reduce human toxicity exposure and tritium generation) LEU (low enrichment uranium, less than 5 percent ) and SEU (slightly enriched uranium, less than 2 percent ) fuel salts in an IMSR is of special interest. Project results will inform future work and build on previous efforts by TEI using EQL0D and Serpent codes (LeBlanc et al., 2018).
•
Improved understanding of IMSR fuel cycles may result in operational IMSR designs that generate significantly less TRU waste at end of Core-Unit life. Since plutonium (and other TRU constituents) dominate radiotoxicity well beyond 300 years, improved waste stream profiles (zero or near zero TRU) will greatly reduce the radiotoxicity and activity half-life of the waste stream. This has significant upside benefit by removing environmental risks while retiring legacy political liabilities and overcoming engineering challenges associated with long-term geologic sequestration of conventional LWR waste while providing future generations of safe, carbon-free energy. Alternative salt fuels might be evaluated on the merits of neutronic, eutectic, thermal–hydraulic performance as well as radiotoxicity and environmental impact. Validation of fuel performance from a physics, chemical, and radiotoxicity perspective is warranted. Molten fuel salts can generally be categorized into Alkali salts, Zr salts, and Be salts (Williams et al., 2006, Thoma, 1971, Zhu and Hawari, 2017). Leading alternative molten fuels include LiF-Be-(Th/U) used by Flibe Energy in the LFTR, NaF-Be-(Th/U) in the Martingale Thorcon reactor, LiF-(U/Pu/La), and TEI while not explicitly stating a preferred fuel salt candidate has mentioned NaF-RbF-U as an example of non-lithium and non-beryllium fuel salt. Alternative Alkali salts include LiF-KF (50–50), LiF-RbF (44–56), Li-NaF-KF “FLiNaK” (46.5–11.5–42), LiF-NaF-RbF (42–6-52). Alternative Zr salts include candidates such as LiF-Zr (51–49), NaF-Zr (59.5–40.5), LiF-NaF-Zr (42–29-29), LiF-NaF-Zr (26–37-37), NaF-RbF-Zr (33–24-43), RbF-Zr (58–42), KF-Zr (58–42). Be salts candidates are LiF-Be ”FLiBe” (67–33), LiF-Be-Zr (64.5–30.5–5), NaF-Be (57–43), and LiF-NaF-Be (31-31-38) (LeBlanc et al., 2018, Dolan, 2017).
•
A full physical study of the molten salt nuclear system must include a multi-physics approach to best understand delayed neutron precursor, salt transport and deposition, and fluid flow-thermal-neutronic stability. Several MOOSE (Multi-physics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) based applications exist that might be coupled in novel ways to create new and powerful simulation analysis. Cross section databases generated by Serpent can be used in follow-on work to link MOOSE multi-physics simulation applications in an object-oriented environment. Multi-physics analysis might include Serpent (for cross section database generation), RELAP 7 (for thermal-fluids, two phase flow modeling), and BISON (fuel and structure performance modeling) to fully integrate evaluation of reactor physics and thermal hydraulic performance of the IMSR in normal and abnormal casualty modes of reactor operation. In addition, coupling PRONGHORN (Porous Medium Flow MOOSE application) and GRIFFIN (Reactor Physics and Radiation Transport MOOSE application) would enable a robust study of transient analysis and design optimization and would allow first-ever predictive modeling of material behaviors at the micro and engineering materials scale. While MOOSE based computing frameworks recently received a significant certification that allows them to be used in safety software applications, much work remains to validate these code for use on MSRs. Much experimental work remains to understand thermophysical and chemical properties of molten salts at various temperatures and densities under irradiation flux conditions to support model and code development.
