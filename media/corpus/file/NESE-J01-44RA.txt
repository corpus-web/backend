<Section>Abstract</Section>
Thermal fatigue cracks have been found at T-junctions where high and low temperature fluids flow in. In this study, the heat transfer coefficient at a T-junction was investigated. The obtained heat transfer coefficient was then validated by estimating the temperatures on a pipe inner surface. The temperatures of the fluid and the pipe inner surface were measured by mock-up tests in which high and low temperature water was mixed. The fluid temperature fluctuation near the boundary between the hot jet flow and the cold main flow caused the temperature on the pipe inner surface to fluctuate. The heat transfer coefficient was obtained by the power spectrum method for the pipe inner surface where the temperature fluctuation was relatively large. The estimated heat transfer coefficient was 3.3 times larger than that calculated by the Dittus-Boelter equation. The temperature on the pipe inner surface was successfully estimated using the obtained heat transfer coefficient and the measured fluid temperature in the vicinity of the inner surface. The prediction error was less than ±20% for the temperature fluctuation range.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Thermal fatigue cracks have been found at T-junctions in nuclear power plants where fluids with different temperatures mix (Chapuliot et al., 2005, McDevitt et al., 2015). The mixing of fluids with a high temperature difference causes fluctuations of the temperature on the pipe inner surface and the initiation of fatigue cracks (hereafter, “thermal striping”). Thermal striping consists of multiple processes as shown in Fig. 1 (Kasahara et al., 2014). First, fluid temperature fluctuation is caused by mixing in the pipe. Second, temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface occurs due to heat transfer from the fluid to the structure. Then the temperature fluctuation is conducted in the direction of pipe wall thickness. Finally, thermal stress fluctuation is induced by the wall temperature fluctuation, resulting in fatigue damage.
Fig. 1. Processes of thermal striping.
Since mixing flow in the T-junction causes complex changes of flow temperature and velocity, it is difficult to estimate the temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface. The wall temperature, however, must to be estimated in order to calculate the thermal stress. Fatigue damage accumulates when the range of maximum stress fluctuation exceeds the fatigue limit of the materials. Therefore, it is desirable to estimate the maximum range of wall temperature fluctuation for fatigue damage assessment.
Numerical simulations for mixing in a T-junction have been conducted (Howard and Pasutto, 2009, Nakamura et al., 2009, Nakamura et al., 2015, Utanohara et al., 2018, Tanaka et al., 2010, Qian et al., 2012, Höhne, 2014, Tanaka and Miyake, 2015, Utanohara et al., 2016). Numerical results of fluid temperature were validated by test results and it was reported that the fluid temperature fluctuation near the pipe wall can be simulated relatively well (Nakamura et al., 2009, Nakamura et al., 2015, Qian et al., 2015, Tanaka et al., 2010, Qian et al., 2012, Tanaka and Miyake, 2015, Utanohara et al., 2018). On the other hand, it remains difficult to predict temperature fluctuations of the pipe wall accurately due to the complicated mechanism of the process of heat transfer from fluid to structure.
Some experiments have been conducted to investigate mixing for thermal fatigue assessment at the T-junction (Fontes et al., 2009, Kamide et al., 2009, Kimura et al., 2009, Courtin, 2013, Smith et al., 2013, Kickhofel et al., 2016, Selvam, 2017, Zhou et al., 2017, Zhou et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2019, Orea et al., 2020). The wall temperature at the T-junction was investigated using thermocouples (Fontes et al., 2009, Kimura et al., 2009, Smith et al., 2013, Kickhofel et al., 2016, Selvam, 2017, Zhou et al., 2017, Zhou et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2019). Temperature measurement at the T-junction by thermal hydraulics tests is not easy, because thermocouples must be installed on the inner surface in order to measure the wall temperature. In addition, the measurement point should be controlled to the location near the surface in order to decrease the effect of the attenuation due to heat conduction in the pipe wall. The temperature should be measured for multiple points to capture the maximum temperature fluctuation. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method for predicting the temperature on the pipe inner surface at the T-junction.
Moriya et al. (2003) developed a method of predicting the surface temperature of a structure using the estimated heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature in the vicinity of the surface. In their method, the power spectrum density (PSD) functions of the fluid and wall temperature fluctuations were used in order to estimate the heat transfer coefficient (referred to as the “power spectrum method”). They demonstrated the validity of the developed method using the temperature measured by the parallel impinging jet test, in which hot and cold water flows were discharged from hot and cold nozzles, respectively, and the flows impinged on the test piece. The validity of the power spectrum method for the T-junction, however, has not been reported yet. Kimura et al. (2009) investigated the heat transfer coefficient at some positions in a T-junction by the power spectrum method, and showed that the estimated heat transfer coefficient was larger than that obtained by the Dittus-Boelter equation (Dittus and Boelter, 1930). Fontes et al. (2009) also examined the heat transfer coefficient at some positions in a T-junction pipe by the power spectrum method, and discussed the impact of the phase delay from fluid to structure by comparing the estimated wall temperature with the measured wall temperature.
In this study, the heat transfer coefficient was investigated in order to predict the maximum temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface in a T-junction. The velocity ratio in the pipe inlets was adjusted to simulate the wall jet flow pattern, which caused a larger fluctuation intensity of fluid temperature near the pipe wall (Kamide et al., 2009). First, the location was identified where the temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface was relatively large. Next, the heat transfer coefficient was estimated using the measured temperature at the identified location. Then the obtained heat transfer coefficient was validated by comparing the measured and estimated temperatures on the pipe inner surface. Finally, the method of assessing the maximum temperature fluctuation range was discussed.
<Section>2. Test method</Section>
2.1. T-Cubic Test loop
Fig. 2 shows a schematic drawing of the T-Cubic test loop (Transient Temperature measurement equipment at a T-junction pipe) (Miyoshi et al., 2016). The mixing of hot and cold water was simulated using this test loop, which consisted of a cold water tank, a hot water tank, a mixing water tank and two pumps. The hot and cold fluids mixed in the test section. The flow rate was controlled by operating valves. Flow straighteners were installed upstream from the test section in order to reduce the fluid turbulence caused by valves and elbows. Velocity distributions upstream from the test section were measured by a laser Doppler velocimeter in advance and the measured velocity distributions were close to the fully developed flow distributions (Miyoshi et al., 2014a). The fluid temperatures in the inlets of the test section were measured with thermocouples which were installed upstream from the flow straighteners. Fig. 3 shows a schematic drawing of the test section for temperature measurement. This test section consisted of a vertical branch pipe with an inner diameter of 50 mm and a horizontal main pipe with an inner diameter of 150 mm, and was made of stainless steel pipes. The thicknesses of the branch pipe and the main pipe were 5.3 mm and 7.6 mm, respectively. The geometry of the test section was almost the same as that of the WATLON experiment (Kamide et al., 2009, Kimura et al., 2009). The outer diameter of each pipe was decided by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) code. These pipes were covered with a heat insulator.

2.2. Temperature measurement of pipe inner surface
The temperature on the pipe inner surface was measured with sheathed thermocouples (diameter 0.5 mm) which were installed near the inner surface. A cross-sectional diagram of the region around an installed thermocouple is shown in Fig. 4. Non-grounded type thermocouples were brazed into grooves 0.6 mm in width and 0.7 mm in depth on the pipe inner surface. Fig. 5 shows the 148 measurement points for temperature on the inner surface of the main pipe. The interval in the circumferential direction was 5° in the range from θ = 0° to 60°. The interval in the axial direction was 25 mm in the range from z =  − 50 to 225 mm. Two thermocouples were installed at θ = 0° and z =  − 150, 600 mm. Here, θ is the azimuthal angle of the main pipe and z is the position in the axial direction of the main pipe (see Fig. 3). The origin is the intersection of the axes of each pipe. The time interval of temperature measurement was 0.02 s. The measured temperatures were calibrated with formulas. The formulas for all the thermocouples were derived using a platinum resistance thermometer under the static water condition. The error of the calibrated temperature was less than ± 0.42 K, which was ± 1.4% for the temperature difference of fluid in the inlets of the main and branch pipes.

Fig. 5. Measurement points for temperature of main pipe inner surface. The interval in the circumferential direction was 5° in the range from θ = 0° to 60°. The interval in the axial direction was 25 mm in the range from z =  − 50 to 225 mm.
The temperature on the pipe inner surface was estimated by inverse analysis using the measured temperature, because the distance between the pipe inner surface and the thermal contact point was 0.45 mm as shown in Fig. 4. The inverse analysis was conducted by numerical simulations, as previously reported in detail (Miyoshi et al., 2014a).
2.3. Temperature measurement of fluid
Fig. 6 shows the apparatus used to measure fluid temperature inside the main pipe (Miyoshi et al., 2014b). The 16 sheathed thermocouples were arranged like the teeth of a comb. The pitch of a measurement point was 5 mm in the range from r = 0 to 70 mm and the outermost point was located at r = 74 mm, which means 1 mm from the inner surface. Each sheathed thermocouple (diameter 0.25 mm) was inserted into a tube with outer diameter of 1.0 mm and length of 50 mm. The final 5 mm of the sheathed thermocouple protruded from the tube end. Since these thermocouples could be moved and rotated in the axial direction of the main pipe, the fluid temperature field could be measured. The temperatures were measured every 0.02 s. Since Kamide et al. (2009) successfully measured the fluid temperature distribution at the T-junction using thermocouples like the teeth of a comb, similar apparatus was used in the present study. The measured temperatures were calibrated in the same way as the temperature on the pipe inner surface. The error of the calibrated temperature was less than ± 0.12 K, which was ± 0.4% for the temperature difference of fluid in the inlets of the main and branch pipes.

2.4. Test conditions and procedure
Fluid temperatures in the inlets of the main and branch pipes were about 20 °C and 50 °C, respectively, their respective mean cross-sectional velocities in the inlets were about 1.0 m/s and 0.7 m/s, and their respective Reynolds numbers in the inlets were about 1.5 × 105 and 6.3 × 104. The cross-sectional velocities were obtained from the flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the flow channel. Kamide et al. (2009) classified flow patterns at a T-junction based on the momentum ratio in the inlets of the main pipe and branch pipe. They also showed that a higher fluctuation intensity of the fluid temperature near the wall was caused when the momentum of jet flow from the branch pipe was small and the jet bent by the flow in the main pipe flowed along the pipe wall. The inlet velocities of the present test were adjusted to simulate this flow pattern.
First, the temperature distribution on the pipe inner surface was measured for 160 s without installing the apparatus for measuring fluid temperature (Fig. 6) inside the main pipe. Next, the temperatures of the fluid and the pipe inner surface were measured simultaneously with the measurement apparatus installed. The thermocouples arranged like the teeth of a comb were moved to the positions of z = 0.33Dm, 0.5Dm, 0.67Dm, 0.83Dm and 1.0 Dm (=50 mm, 75 mm, 100 mm, 125 mm and 150 mm) and rotated in the circumferential direction in order to measure the fluid temperature distribution. The measurement interval in the circumferential direction was 5°. The minimum scale values in the axial direction and the circumferential direction were 1 mm and 1°. It is assumed that the uncertainty of the measurement location is z = ±0.2 mm and θ = ±0.2°. The temperatures were measured for 160 s at each position. Heat transfer coefficients were estimated from the measured temperatures at the pipe inner surface and at the fluid in the vicinity of the surface (1 mm from the inner surface).

3.1. Temperature on pipe inner surface
Fig. 7 shows the distributions of the time-averaged temperature and the temperature fluctuation range on the inner surface as measured by thermocouples. The fluctuation range was defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the time history. These temperatures were normalized by the following equations:
@(1)
@(2)
where Tw,ave is the time-averaged wall temperature on the pipe inner surface during 160 s, Tm and Tb are the fluid temperatures in the inlets of the main and branch pipes, and Tw,max and Tw,min are the maximum and minimum temperatures on the pipe inner surfaces during 160 s, respectively. The contours were drawn by linear interpolation. The time-averaged temperature was relatively high downstream from the junction of the main and branch pipes. The time-averaged temperature exhibited the maximum value at the edge of the junction and decreased along the line of θ = 0°. On the other hand, the temperature fluctuation range was not so large for the area where the time-averaged temperature was relatively high. It became large locally in the range from the edge of the junction to z = 1.0Dm (=150 mm) and from θ = 10° to 40°.

3.2. Fluid temperature
Fig. 8 shows the distributions of the time-averaged temperature and the temperature fluctuation range of fluid measured by thermocouples in the range from θ = 0° to 60° at z = 0.5Dm. These temperatures were normalized by the following equations:
@(3)
@(4)
where Tf,ave is the time-averaged fluid temperature, and Tf,max and Tf,min are the maximum and minimum fluid temperatures during 160 s, respectively. The contours were drawn by linear interpolation. The time-averaged temperature was relatively high in the range from r = 0.4Rm (=30 mm) to 0.99Rm (=74 mm) and from θ = 0° to 35°, where Rm is the inner radius of the main pipe. On the other hand, the temperature fluctuation range was relatively large in the range from θ = 15° to 50°, which was around the boundary between the hot jet flow and the cold main flow. It has been reported that a large-scale hairpin vortex occurred around the boundary (Tanaka et al., 2010). Since the hot jet flow was swayed by the vortex, the fluid temperature fluctuations seemed to be induced around the boundary. The range from θ = 30° to 40° where the fluid temperature fluctuation became large was close to the position of the large temperature fluctuation range on the inner surface as shown in Fig. 7 (b).

4.1. Estimation procedure
Moriya et al. (2003) reported a procedure for estimating the heat transfer coefficient for thermal striping. Their procedure, the power spectrum method, was applied in this study and is shown in Fig. 9. At first, the PSD Φw and Φf are obtained from measured temperatures for the pipe inner surface and fluid in the vicinity of the inner surface. Then the ratio Φw/Φf is calculated. On the other hand, Φw/Φf can be expressed theoretically by the following equations:
@(5)
@(6)
where ρw, cpw and λw, are density, specific heat at constant pressure and thermal conductivity for the pipe wall, respectively, f is frequency and h is heat transfer coefficient. These equations can be obtained from the one-dimensional heat transfer model (Moriya et al., 2003). The heat transfer coefficient h included in e of Eq. (5), therefore, can be obtained by best-fit regression for Φw/Φf which is calculated from the measured temperatures.
Fig. 9. Procedure in the power spectrum method used to estimate the heat transfer coefficient h. ΦW and Φf are power spectrum densities of the pipe inner surface and fluid in the vicinity of the surface. h can be obtained by best-fit regression for Φw / Φf.
4.2. Estimation
The heat transfer coefficient h was estimated for 17 points (indicated by × mark in Fig. 7 (b)) where the temperature fluctuation range on the inner surface was relatively large. Fig. 10 shows Φw and Φf for the measured temperature at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° (Point A in Fig. 7 (b)). The fluid temperature at r = 0.99Rm (1 mm from the pipe inner surface) was used to obtain Φf. PSD was obtained by applying the following averaging method to emphasize the dominant frequency. The time series data set for a time length of 81.92 s (4096 data × 0.02 s time interval) was extracted from the original 160 s time series data (8000 data). Then, another time series data set was extracted with the start time of 1.0 s. Namely, the time series data set from 1.0 s to 81.92 + 1.0 s was obtained. By shifting the start time, a total of 70 sets of time series data were obtained, and PSD was calculated 70 times for these data sets. Then the averaged PSD was obtained from the 70 PSD data.

Fig. 11 shows Φw/Φf obtained from the measured temperature and the regression curve using Eq. (5). The heat transfer coefficient h was obtained as 8795 W/(m2K) by best-fit regression in the range from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. The PSD for less than 0.1 Hz was not used, because the data were not reliable due to the limitation of the measuring time. The wall temperature fluctuation for data larger than 10 Hz was small and did not contribute to the thermal stress fluctuation (Miyoshi et al., 2016). The obtained heat transfer coefficient h for other locations are listed in Table 1. The normalized heat transfer coefficient h* was obtained as h/hDB using the heat transfer coefficient hDB calculated from the following equation (Dittus and Boelter, 1930):

where Nu is Nusselt number, Dm is inner diameter of the main pipe, λf is heat conductivity of fluid, Re is Reynolds number and Pr is Prandtl number. Re and Pr were calculated using the mean cross-sectional velocity and the equilibrium temperature after mixing. Fig. 12 shows the estimated h* at each axial position. The h* changed in the circumferential direction for the same axial position. The minimum and maximum values were 1.2 and 3.3, respectively. The data obtained by Kimura et al. (2009) are also shown in Fig. 12. Their experiments were conducted under similar conditions of the ratio of pipe diameter (Dm = 150 mm, Db = 50 mm) and the ratio of inlet velocity for main and branch pipes (Vm = 1.46 m/s, Vb = 1.00 m/s). The present data were nearly the same as the data of Kimura et al.

<Section>5. Validation of estimated heat transfer coefficient</Section>
5.1. Procedure for estimating temperature on pipe inner surface
The temperature on the pipe inner surface was recalculated from the estimated heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature in the vicinity of the surface to validate the heat transfer coefficient. Then the prediction accuracy was examined by comparing the calculated temperature with the temperature on the pipe inner surface as measured by thermocouples. The calculated temperature on the pipe inner surface was obtained by one-dimensional heat conduction analysis using the commercial code Abaqus (version 6.14). The analysis procedure and boundary conditions for this estimation are shown in Fig. 13. The heat transfer coefficient h listed in Table 1 and the measured fluid temperature Tf at 1 mm from the inner surface (at r = 0.99Rm) were used to obtain the heat flux qinner on the inner surface. The outer boundary of the pipe was adiabatic. The time averaged temperature of the fluid was used as the initial temperature of the pipe wall. The interval of nodes in the thickness direction was 0.1 mm uniformly. Material properties employed for the heat conduction analysis are listed in Table 2.

5.2. Estimated and measured temperatures
Fig. 14 shows the estimated and measured temperatures on the inner surface at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° where the largest temperature fluctuation range T*w,max-min was observed. This figure shows the temperature during 10 s extracted from the temperature during the period of 160 s to facilitate comparison. These temperatures were normalized by the following equation:
@(8)
where Tw is temperature on the inner surface. The temperature obtained using the heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature agreed well with the measured temperature. The values of the temperature fluctuation range T*w,max-min defined by Eq. (2) were 0.26 and 0.27 for the calculated and measured temperatures, respectively. The heat transfer coefficient seems to change in time for the location where the temperature fluctuates as shown in Fig. 14. The estimated temperature, however, agreed well with the measured temperature in spite of the application of a constant heat transfer coefficient. The constant heat transfer coefficient was obtained by best-fit regression as shown in Fig. 11. Since the deviation of Φw/Φf from the fitting curve was smaller as frequency decreased, the predictive performance of low-frequency component might be better than that of high-frequency component, and the temperature on the inner surface seems to be estimated successfully.
Fig. 14. Estimated and measured temperatures on the inner surface at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20°. The temperature during 10 s extracted from the temperature of 160 s is shown to facilitate comparison.
In general, it is known that fatigue damage accumulates when the maximum stress fluctuation range exceeds the fatigue limit of the materials. Therefore, it is important to predict the temperature fluctuation range T*w,max-min to estimate the fatigue damage. Fig. 15 shows the estimated T*w,max-min and the measured T*w,max-min at the 17 locations shown in Table 1. Comparison with the measured values indicated that the prediction error was less than ±20%.

<Section>6. Discussion</Section>
It has been reported that the fluid temperature near the wall at the T-junction can be simulated relatively well by numerical simulations as described in Section 1. The wall temperature fluctuations, however, have not been simulated accurately, because it is difficult to predict the attenuation of the temperature fluctuation from fluid to structure. It is also not easy to measure temperature on the pipe inner surface as described in Section 2.2. Therefore it is desirable to predict the temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface using the fluid temperature obtained by numerical simulations and tests.
The results shown in Fig. 14, Fig. 15 demonstrated that the temperature fluctuation range T*w,max-min was successfully estimated by the analysis procedure shown in Fig. 13 when the heat transfer coefficient h and the fluid temperature in the vicinity of the pipe wall were given. It is noteworthy that the h used was constant over time. This implies that the variation in temperature on the pipe inner surface can be predicted by considering the thermal resistance of 1/h.
Fig. 16 shows the estimated T*w,max-min obtained using the fluid temperature fluctuations at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° and r = 0.99Rm (1 mm from the inner surface). Since the maximum h* was 3.3 as shown in Table 1, T*w,max-min was estimated conservatively using h = 3.3hDB. The estimated T*w,max-min for h = 3.3hDB was nearly equal to the measured T*w,max-min. On the other hand, the estimated T*w,max-min for h = hDB was less than the measured T*w,max-min. The Dittus-Boelter equation is used to obtain the heat transfer coefficient for fully developed turbulent flow in a straight pipe. Kimura et al. (2009) reported that high velocity in the vicinity of the wall increased the heat transfer from fluid to structure at the T-junction. Since local turbulent flow in the T-junction enhanced the heat transfer, T*w,max-min for h = hDB seems to be underestimated. It should be noted that underestimating T*w,max-min leads to non-conservative fatigue assessment. It is easy and conservative to assume that T*w,max-min is equal to the fluid temperature fluctuation range T*f,max-min. However, the maximum T*f,max-min (=0.92) is much larger than the measured T*w,max-min as shown in Fig. 16. This means that the assumption of T*w,max-min = T*f,max-min causes a result that is too conservative for fatigue assessment. These facts show that the heat transfer coefficient multiplied by 3.3 should be used to estimate T*w,max-min. The multiplication coefficient of 3.3 might depend on the test conditions such as velocity ratio and diameter ratio. The effect of boundary conditions on the multiplication coefficient should be investigated in a future work.
Fig. 16. Measured and estimated T*w, max-min at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20°. The measured T*f, max-min at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° was 0.92.
Fig. 17 shows the relationship between T*f,max-min and T*w,max-min measured at the 17 locations listed in Table 1. The fluid temperature fluctuation in the vicinity of the wall did not correlate with the temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface. This means that the position of the maximum T*f,max-min does not correspond to that of the maximum T*w,max-min. Fig. 18 (a) shows PSD functions for the measured fluid temperature at the position (z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°) where T*f,max-min became the largest and the position (z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20°) where T*w,max-min became the largest. This figure shows that these frequency characteristics for fluid temperature were similar. On the other hand, Fig. 18 (b) shows the PSD for the temperature at the inner surface of z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° was larger than that at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°. This means that the heat transfer from fluid to structure at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° was larger than that at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°. The heat transfer coefficients (=h) at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35° and z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° were 3927 W/(m2K) and 8795 W/(m2K) as shown in Table 1, respectively. The difference in the heat transfer coefficient seems to be caused by not the frequency characteristic of fluid temperature but other causes. Fig. 19 (a) shows the measured temperatures at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°. Fig. 19 (b) shows the measured temperatures at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20°. The fluid temperature at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35° increased intermittently. In contrast, the fluid temperature at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° decreased intermittently. These facts mean that on average the position shown in Fig. 19 (a) was located outside the hot jet flow while the position shown in Fig. 19 (b) was located inside the hot jet flow. It was reported that the fluctuation intensity of velocity inside the jet flow increased due to eddies in the wake region (Kamide et al., 2009). The velocity fluctuation inside the jet flow seems to increase the heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, although T*f,max-min became the largest at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°, T*w,max-min was maximized at z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° rather than at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35°.

Fig. 19. Measured temperatures at the inner surface and 1 mm from wall. Z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35° is the position where T*f,max-min became largest while z = 0.67Dm, θ = 20° is the position where T*w,max-min became largest.
T*w,max-min did not become the largest at the position where the maximum T*f,max-min was measured. This implies that the heat transfer process from fluid to structure mitigated the maximum T*w,max-min. Therefore, the maximum temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface could be predicted conservatively by using the maximum heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature in the vicinity of the wall where T*f,max-min became the largest for the present test conditions. T*w,max-min was estimated using h = 3.3hDB and the fluid temperature at z = 0.33Dm, θ = 35° and r = 0.99Rm. The estimated T*w,max-min was 0.38 and larger than the maximum value (=0.27) of the measured T*w,max-min. In addition, the estimated value (=0.38) was much less than the maximum fluid temperature fluctuation range (=0.92). This result shows that the maximum temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface could be predicted reasonably.
<Section>7. Conclusions</Section>
The temperatures for the fluid and the pipe inner surface were measured at the T-junction where high and low temperature water mix. The heat transfer coefficient on the pipe inner surface was obtained by the power spectrum method. Then the temperature on the pipe inner surface was estimated by the obtained heat transfer coefficient and the measured fluid temperature in the vicinity of the inner surface. The following conclusions were obtained.
(1)
The fluid temperature fluctuation near the boundary between the hot jet flow and the cold main flow caused the temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface. The temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface was relatively large from the edge of the junction to z = 1.0Dm and from θ = 10° to 40°.
(2)
The estimated heat transfer coefficients were larger than those calculated by the Dittus-Boelter equation and the maximum value was 3.3 times larger.
(3)
The temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface was successfully estimated using the obtained heat transfer coefficient and the measured fluid temperature in the vicinity of the inner surface. The prediction error was less than ± 20% for the temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface.
(4)
The temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface did not become the largest at the position where the maximum fluid temperature fluctuation range was measured, because the heat transfer coefficient depended on the fluid structures such as eddies inside the hot jet flow. Therefore the maximum temperature fluctuation range on the pipe inner surface could be predicted reasonably using the maximum heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature in the vicinity of the pipe wall where the fluctuation range became the largest.
