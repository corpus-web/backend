Abstract
Ruthenium oxide catalysts supported on various metal oxides, such as zirconia, ceria, and alumina, were prepared by an impregnation method using RuCl3·3H2O as a precursor. Local structures of the supported Ru oxide and oxidation states of Ru species were analyzed by in situ Ru K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. Small RuO2 particles were highly dispersed on zirconia and ceria. On the other hand, bulk RuO2 was deposited on alumina. Enantioselective hydrogenation of diethyl itaconate was achieved by combining the supported RuO2 catalysts with chiral ligands. The 1 wt% RuO2 supported on zirconia provided 95% ee and 99% yield. The Ru oxide was partially reduced during the reaction.

1. Introduction
Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most widely used, efficient methods to obtain optically active compounds in the fields of fine chemical synthesis. Noyori et al. reported enantioselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones with Ru(II) complex catalysts having chiral ligands, e.g. (S)- and (R)-2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl ((S)- and (R)-BINAP) (Noyori, 2002, Noyori, 2013). For practical uses in the industry, the reactions with heterogeneous catalysts have advantages because of their lower cost, easy separation, and recycling. There are several reports of enantioselective reactions on supported catalysts. For example, enantioselective hydrogenation of α-phenylcinnamic acids in the presence of cinchonidine-modified supported Pd catalysts (Nitta et al., 2005) and enantioselective hydrogenation of β-ketoesters in the presence of asymmetrically modified Ni catalysts (Nakagawa et al., 1997) were reported. In addition, Miura et al. reported that regio- and stereoselectivity of the addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes with ceria-supported Ru oxide catalysts were controlled by phosphines additives (Miura et al., 2011). In this study, we employed a reaction method introducing chiral ligands to Ru oxide catalysts supported on various metal oxides for asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. Besides, local structures and oxidation states of the supported Ru species were analyzed by in situ Ru K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements under reaction conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Ru oxide catalysts supported on metal oxides, such as ZrO2, CeO2, and Al2O3, were prepared by an impregnation method. The typical preparation procedure of 1 wt% Ru supported catalyst is as follows: 26.1 mg of RuCl3·3H2O (Furuya Metal Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of distilled water, and the solution was added to 1.0 g of metal oxide (ZrO2 (JRC–ZRO–6, Catalysis Society of Japan), CeO2 (HS, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.), and Al2O3 (Neobeads, Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals, Ltd.)), respectively. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After the impregnation, water was removed by vacuum freeze-drying. The obtained solid was calcined at 823 K for 4 h under air.
2.2. XAFS measurements
Ru K-edge XAFS measurements were performed at the BL14B2 beamline of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) (Honma et al., 2009) without energy calibration. Synchrotron radiation from the storage ring, which was operated at 8 GeV with a maximum current of 100 mA, was monochromated by a Si (311) double-crystal. The experiments were conducted in the fluorescence mode using a 19-element Ge solid-state detector and an ionization chamber for the measurement of the incident flux. The collection of a XAFS spectrum required approximately 7.5 min using the quick scan system. In situ XAFS spectra under the reaction condition were also collected using the same optical system as the XAFS measurements. Autoclaves with PEEK window for X-ray to go through were used (Fig. S-1). The XAFS spectra were analyzed by using the program REX2000 (Rigaku Co.).

2.3. Catalytic reactions
The typical catalytic reaction is carried out as follows: diethyl itaconate (Tokyo Chemical Industry) (0.4 mmol), the catalyst (1.0 mol%), (S)-BINAP (Kanto Kagaku Chemical) (1.1 mol%), tridecane (0.21 mmol) as internal standard, and degassed methanol (2 mL) as a solvent were introduced into a stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed after replacing the residual air with H2 (1 atm), and then heated at 313 K for 24 h. The resulting mixture was filtrated through celite and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and chiral GC.
All of the chemical materials were used without further purification.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Local structures of the supported Ru catalysts
Fig. 1 shows ex situ Ru K-edge XAFS spectra of as-prepared catalysts supported on various metal oxides. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra profiles of the catalysts (Fig. 1a) were similar to that of RuO2 and no characteristic pre-edge 1s-4d transition, which indicated tetrahedral coordination structure of Ru oxide (Hosokawa et al., 2005, Sardar et al., 2014), was observed. The results indicate that the octahedral coordination structure of RuO2 was supported on the metal oxides. The frequency and the relative amplitude of the k3-weighted EXAFS function of the as-prepared catalysts are compared to those of RuO2 in Fig. 1b. Although the frequency of the k3-weighted oscillations for the 1 wt% Ru/CeO2 and 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 were similar to that for RuO2, the relative amplitudes were smaller. The oscillations for the 1 wt% Ru/Al2O3 and 5 wt% Ru/ZrO2 were similar to those for RuO2. Four peaks were observed on the radial distribution functions (RDFs) for RuO2, 1 wt% Ru/Al2O3, and 5 wt% Ru/ZrO2 (Fig. 1c) in the range of 1.0–2.0 Å, 2.3–3.8 Å, 3.8–4.5 Å, and 4.5–6.0 Å, respectively. On the other hand, only the peaks in the range of 1.0–2.0 Å appeared on those for 1 wt% Ru/CeO2 and 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2. The peak in the range of 1.0–2.0 Å and 2.3–3.8 Å were attributed to Ru–O (first nearest-neighbor atoms) coordination and Ru–Ru (second nearest-neighbor atoms) coordination, respectively. Table S-2 shows structure parameters for the catalysts obtained by curve-fitting analyses of the functions inversely Fourier-transformed into the k-space using the structure model listed in Table S-1. Octahedrally coordinated Ru oxides were highly dispersed on 1 wt% Ru/CeO2 and 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 because the peaks of second and third nearest-shells were not observed in their RDFs and the coordination numbers of Ru-O were less than six.
3.2. Asymmetric hydrogenation of diethyl itaconate
The catalytic performances and selectivity of the supported Ru catalysts for hydrogenation of diethyl itaconate were investigated. As shown in Table 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 and 1 wt% Ru/CeO2 exhibit high yield and enantioselectivity (entries 1 and 2). When the loading amount of Ru was increased (5 wt% Ru/ZrO2), the enantioselectivity was still higher than 90% but the yield has decreased to 9%. Ru/Al2O3, which was bulk RuO2, showed very low catalytic activity. Considering the results of the XAFS analyses, highly dispersed Ru oxides showed high activity. Enantioselectivity was decreased when the amount of the added BINAP was reduced, although almost the same amount of hydrogenation products was obtained (entries 5 and 6). It seems that BINAP was coordinated with Ru oxide species during the reaction.

Leached amounts of Ru ions in hot filtrated solution after the reaction using 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 and 1 wt% Ru/Al2O3 were measured by plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. These results indicate that the leached Ru ions had no activity.
3.3. Oxidation states of Ru on 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 during the catalytic reaction
The average oxidation states of Ru on 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 were determined using the correlation between the oxidation states and the edge energy of various standard ruthenium compounds given by XAFS spectra (Fig. 2). The energy shifts of the edge positions are found to vary linearly with the oxidation states of Ru (Sardar et al., 2014). The correlation coefficient is R = 0.997. The edge energy of the catalyst before the reaction was observed at 22,133.4 eV, and the oxidation state of Ru was determined as 3.3 by the relationship shown in Fig. 2c. This would then suggest that Ru oxide species were reduced under the reaction condition, which coexisted with H2 and BINAP. During the reaction, a shift of Ru K-edge to lower energies from 22,132.6 eV to 22,131.6 eV was observed. The edge energy was observed at 22,131.9 and 22,131.6 eV after 1 h and 7 h of the reaction, and then the oxidation states of Ru were determined as 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. The active species of the asymmetric hydrogenation of diethyl itaconate seems to be partially reduced small RuO2 particles.

Before the reaction, a dominant FT peak of 1 wt% Ru/ZrO2 was observed at the same distance of RuO2 (Fig. 1c). After 7 h of the reaction, the peak position was slightly moved to longer distance (Fig. S-2c). Compared with RuO2, other reference materials, such as Ru(OAc)2(binap) and RuCl2(PPh3)3, whom Ru atoms coordinated with P atoms, showed longer coordination distances of the first nearest-neighbored atoms as shown in Fig. S-2c. The results are consistent with the assumption that the P atoms of BINAP coordinated to Ru atoms of the catalysts during the reaction.
4. Conclusion
RuO2 highly dispersed on ZrO2 (1 wt% Ru/ZrO2) having octahedral coordination structure exhibited high activity (99% yield) and high enantioselectivity (95% ee) for asymmetric hydrogenation of diethyl itaconate. The active species of the reaction, which was partially reduced small RuO2 particles, was formed under reaction condition with H2 and chiral ligands, BINAP.
