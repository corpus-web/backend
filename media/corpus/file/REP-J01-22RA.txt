ABSTRACT
In the current study, it was shown that Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) composites holding tungsten (VI) oxide were formed in groups (10%–50%) by radical polymerization. For this goal, Styrene and HEMA reacted with AIBN for
2.5 h at 65 � C in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give the consistent polymer. Synthesized Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) were
defined by FTIR, GPC (Mn    17,100 g/mol PDI    2.2) and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene)
-tungsten (VI) oxide composites formed between 80 and 85 � C. The linear attenuation coefficients of the com- posites were measured by the NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometry system. Attenuation coefficients were also estimated hypothetically by the XCOM platform, taking into account the fundamental analysis of composites and comparing them with empirical outcomes. Consistent with the consequences of SEM analysis, there is a homo- geneous distribution among tungsten (VI) oxide units and Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene). Shielding parameters as the tenth value thickness, the half-value thickness, and the mean free path were acquired. Among the composites studied, the best protective material was PS 50% WO3 with lower absorption thicknesses and a higher linear slimming coefficient. Thermal degradation of unirradiated and irradiated polymer composites has also been examined.

1.Introduction
Nuclear energy has many applications in different fields such as medicine, industry, agriculture, etc. Although these great benefits, the radiation has a risk to humans’ health. So it is important to protect against it by designing a shield between the radiation source and the surrounding environment. Generally, the radiations that must be considered are neutrons and gamma-rays where each of them has a different way of interaction with the matter for that it’s important to study the attenuation of these rays in the materials to choose the most effective shield depending on radiation type and its energy (Dawood, 2017; Knoll et al., 2000; Tsoulfanidis, 1995). Different materials can be designed for radiation protection. For instance, to protect from gamma-rays, concrete, tungsten, steel, and lead are used extensively. Lead shielding materials are used where thinner thicknesses are required (Erdem et al., 2010; Harrison et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the low melting point and poisonous of lead is the weakness of it (Lamarsh and Baratta, 2001). Also, steel or iron is used for shielding of gamma-ray but they are high cost materials in production (Gorbatkina et al., 2007). Concrete is often used in the building as biological shields. Tungsten is an appealing
material for small shields or collimators. Styrene butadiene-styrene copolymer and tungsten could be obtained as a new material addi- tional to lead. Yue K et al. reported that a new polymer composite ma- terial can be used for radiation shielding without lead with the Monte Carlo method (Yue et al., 2009). In another study, it was reported that
polymer composites including metals could be used as shielding mate- rials in radiotherapy ((Kaur et al., 2016)). Bobadilla-Sa�nchez et al. and Martínez-Barrera et al. worked with the concrete-polyester mixture to determine the potential of shielding materials (Bobadilla-S�anchez et al., 2009; Martínez-Barrera et al., 2013). Lead, bronze, copper and ferrous metals besides polymer composite metals have been compared by Dur- kee et al. (Durkee, n.d.).
In this research, we introduced the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) com- posites combining two different polymer properties of styrene and HEMA The first of these property is the radiation-resistant of poly- styrene. The second one is the intermolecular interaction of poly(HEMA) with tungsten(VI) oxides. So Tungsten (VI) oxide with different con- centrations (10,20,30,40,50) % have been added to Poly(HEMA-co- Styrene) to study shield designs that can be used to reduce radiation danger in this study.

2.1.Instrumentation
The molecular weight of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) is determined by gel permeability chromatography. THF as an eluent is used at the run rate of 1 mL/min (RI detector). FTIR spectra were noted in a Perki- nElmer FTIR Spectrometer. TGA measurements of composites were made on PerkinElmer Diamond TA/TGA between 30 and 1000 � C with the heating speed at 10 � C/min under the nitrogen atmosphere. Sample weights were taken between 9 and 10 mg. SEM images 6.0 mm using an area emission-scanning electron microscope. The analyses of X-ray
diffraction were obtained by Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer. 1H-
NMR measurements were noted in deuterium chloroform using varian AS-400 device.
2.2.Synthesis of poly(HEMA-co-styrene)
After 25 mL(0.20 mol) of HEMA and 25 mL (0.22 mol) Styrene were dissolved in 100 mL of the solvent (THF), (0.012 mol)3 g of BPO was added to this solution. After stirring along 120 min, the obtained
products were lastly precipitated in methanol. (Mn 17,100 PDI 2.2.) The structure of polymer confirmed by 1HNMR and FTIR spectroscopy.
2.3.Preparation of WO3⋅ 2H2O
The WO3⋅2H2O was synthesized via Mecheri’s procedure (Mecheri et al., 2006).
2.3.1.The morphology of polymer composites
Polymer composites were examined by the SEM apparatus for the dispersion status of particles Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) and Poly(HEMA- co-Styrene)-50% composite, shown in Fig. 1a.

The patterns are compatible prior study on the essential tungsten oxide(VI) dihydrate data (Mecheri et al., 2006).
2.3.3.Preparation of poly(HEMA-co-styrene) -composites
After Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) and WO3⋅ 2H2O were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 60 � C for 120 min. Poly(HEMA-co- Styrene)-tungsten(VI) oxide composites prepared and the solutions of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene)/WO3 composites were acquired by changing
the weight % of WO3⋅2H2O. Casting on a silicon plate, the combination cured between 80 and 85 � C for 1 day. Then they were dried at 100 �C (Scheme 1) (Ko€rpınar et al., 2020).
2.3.4.Gamma-ray attenuation measurements
The experimental attenuation coefficients for composite samples were determined by a gamma spectrometer system consisting of a 300 300 NaI (T1) scintillation detector (CANBERRA) coupled with electronic equipment and PC-based multichannel pulse analyzer. The NaI(Tl) de- tector having an energy resolution of 7.5% for 137Cs gamma-rays (662
keV) was shielded by lead bricks (110 mm-thick) and internally lined with a copper foil (1.5 mm). And also, a collimator setup was used to obtain good geometry measurements and to guard the detector from any

scattered gamma-rays (Fig. 2). IAEA point sources of 60Co (1172 and 1332 keV) and 137Cs (662 keV) were utilized for irradiation of the composite samples. The distance between the composites and the de-
tector was kept 20 cm.
The measurement time for the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) and Poly (HEMA-co-Styrene) WO3 composite samples and also background measurements were 900 s. And then, the net counting rates proportional to the intensity at full energy peak were calculated by making back- ground correction for the measured gamma intensities of composite sets of different thicknesses (0, 1, 2 and 3 mm). As an example, Fig. 3 shows the gamma-ray spectrums of the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) þ50% WO3 obtained for without composite material (I0) and with composite ma- terial in 0.3 cm thickness (Ix). The linear gamma attenuation coefficients of the all prepared composites were calculated to the Lambert’s Beer Law for gamma-rays given below.

2.3.5.Theoretical linear attenuation coefficients
The linear attenuation coefficient varies with the absorber density. Therefore, the mass attenuation coefficient for given gamma-ray energy
is commonly used which is independent of the physical properties of the absorber. In this study, to calculate theoretical linear attenuation co- efficients, the theoretical mass attenuation coefficients were obtained primarily using XCOM software developed by Berger and his colleagues (Berger, M. J.; Hubbell, 1987). This program uses relative basic fractions of materials to calculate mass attenuation coefficients. The density of polymer composite materials was calculated according to the literature (Osei-Mensah et al., 2012). Thus, the relative elemental fractions and densities of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) tungsten oxide composites were listed in Table 1. inally, theoretical gamma attenuation coefficient values were obtained by multiplying mass attenuation coefficients by the density of the composite (Equation. 3).@3
where ρ presents the density of the composites in g/cm3; μm and μ the mass attenuation coefficient in cm2/g and the linear attenuation coef- ficient in cm—1, respectively.
2.3.6.Transmission parameters
Transmission parameters define the effectiveness of gamma-ray screening of materials. Thus, parameters were calculated as half-value thickness (x1/2), tenth value thickness (x1=10) and the mean free path (λ). A half-value thickness (x1/2) is the essential absorbent thickness for reducing the photon density in the event. Likewise, the tenth value thickness (x1=10) is the essential absorbent thickness for reducing the photon density in the event to ten. In addition, the mean free path (λ) is

defined as the average distance between the two subsequent interactions of photons (Akkurt et al., 2010; Go€kçe et al., 2018). As a result, trans- mission parameters were calculated using Eq. (4) for x1/2, Eq. (5) for x1/10 and Eq. (6) for λ by means of determined linear attenuation co-
efficients for 662 keV, 1173 keV and 1332 keV.@4

3.Results and discussion
In the current study, we have effectively synthesized Poly(HEMA-co- Styrene) based on additional polymerization method. The Structure of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) was confirmed by 1HNMR and FTIR (Fig. 5 and
Fig. 6) respectively. Subsequently, Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene)-tungsten(VI) composites were prepared in DMF. Several composites were prepared with tungsten in order to reduce the intensity of radiation by several researchers. In a study in the literature, the efficiency of electron stop- ping in radiotherapy was theoretically reported for Tungsten and
styrene-butadiene copolymer. (Bobadilla-Sa�nchez et al., 2009; Durkee,
n.d.; Gorbatkina et al., 2007; Martínez-Barrera et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2009). In many other studies, the metallic form of tungsten powder was obtained by combining physically with the polymer and mixtures. However, in our study, we synthesized the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) composites to put together both the resistance of styrene to radiation and also the intermolecular interaction of HEMA with tungsten(VI) ox- ides. Aside from current studies, we introduced the Poly(HEMA-co-S- tyrene) composites combining two different polymer properties of styrene and HEMA in a structure that a more homogenous distributed and a more strictly stacked. So, the homogeneities of polymer samples were tested with SEM analysis. The morphology of SEM WO3⋅2H2O powder, Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene), and Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene)-50 wt% tungsten(VI) oxides composite were indicated in Fig. 1. The SEM mi- crographs exhibited a rougher fracture surface in the WO3-loaded polymer sample compared to the neat sample due to the presence of well dispersed and well separated WO3. SEM micrographs revealed the flat

and clean fracture surface of the matrix with some cracks in the matrix side of the polymer-matrix interface in the conventional WO3 whereas nanophased WO3 showed rougher fracture of the matrix with randomly but uniformly distributed WO3 throughout the matrix that appeared to cling to polymers well. Consistent with the obtained results, when WO3⋅ 2H2O was combined into the polymer matrices, we can see that WO3 powder was fit dispersed in polymer matrices (Rahimi et al., 2009; Rahman and Mujumdar, 2011; Verdipoor et al., 2018).
3.1.Linear gamma attenuation coefficients and shielding parameters of polymer composites
The linear gamma attenuation coefficients for Poly(HEMA-co-Sty- rene) composite samples were measured for 662, 1173 and 1332 keV gamma energies. In addition to experimental results, the theoretical
values were calculated in a wide energy range of 1 keV and 108 keV,
since these three closer energy lines do not characterize the all gamma- ray energies encountered. Experimental and theoretical linear attenua- tion coefficients of the so-called composite samples were given in

Table 2 for 662 keV, 1173 keV, and 1332 keV in order to compare them. Additionally, the theoretical linear gamma attenuation coefficients of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) composites were demonstrated between 1 keV
and 108 keV energies in Fig. 7. The linear attenuation coefficients of
composites decreased exponentially, and some edges were seen due to the binding energies of electrons in the K, L, M electron shells of the absorber atom in the low-energy zone between 1 keV and 400 keV. In the energy range from 400 keV to 6000 keV, the linear attenuations of all composites decreased linearly with increasing energy and the values approached each other. In this region, probably the Compton scattering was the dominant mechanism because of Compton scattering cross- section change linearly with atomic number Z. From 6000 keV to 150,000 keV the linear attenuation coefficients decreased exponentially
again. At high energies after 150,000 keV, the linear attenuation co- efficients started to increase slightly and this case can be attributed to pair production. As can be seen obviously, the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) 50% WO3 was the best absorber of all Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) com- posites in all energies.
In order to emphasize the effect of the additives of tungsten(VI) oxide (10%–50%) in Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) composites in terms of radiation shielding, the relation of the measured linear attenuation coefficients and percentage of tungsten additive were investigated (Fig. 8). While the linear gamma attenuation coefficients of the composite samples decreased with the increasing energy, they enlarged with thickness of materials. Thus, parameters were calculated as half-value thickness (x1/ 2), tenth value thickness (x1/10) and mean free path (λ). A half-value

thickness (x1/2) is the essential absorbent thickness for reducing the photon density in the event. Likewise, the tenth value layer (TVL) is the absorbent thickness required to reduce the photon density in the event to ten. In addition, the average freeway (MFP) is defined as the average distance between the two subsequent interactions of photons of the tungsten(VI) oxide (10%-%50) additives. As compared with Poly (HEMA-co-Styrene), gamma shielding capabilities of composites increased by about 7%, 22%, 36%, 52%, and 72% for tungsten(VI) oxide
additives of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% for 662 keV, respectively. For 1173 and 1332 keV energies, the tungsten(VI) oxide increased the gamma shielding in the percentage of (9–11)%, (15–18)%, (27–33)%,
(35–37)% and (57–58)% for 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% additives, respectively.
The density is a major factor in gamma shielding, so the variations of linear gamma attenuation coefficient values of composite samples with densities were indicated in Fig. 9 as well. The linear gamma attenuation coefficients and densities of the composite samples were strongly related
(R2   0.98). Therefore, high density (ρ) and high atomic number (Z)
were increased the shielding property because of an increase in the possibility of interaction and energy transfer with gamma rays.
The gamma-ray transmission rates of composites were subtracted depending on experimental linear gamma attenuation coefficient values and the results were given in Table 3. The half-value thickness (x1/2, cm), tenth-value thickness (x1/10, cm) and mean free path (λ, cm) values were illustrated according to tungsten(VI) oxide additive for the photon energies of 662, 1173 and 1332 keV in Fig. 10. The minimum required absorber thickness value was 4.1 cm for the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) 50% WO3 for 662 keV, thus the more tungsten(VI) oxide additive
and lower gamma energy leads to decrease absorber thickness.
When the results for this study are compared with the values in the literature (see Table 4), our results were comparable or even higher than
the data in the literature. For example, in the study of Verdipor et al. the linear attenuation coefficients of 50% W03 (micro)-silicon resin com- posites were calculated to be 0.140 cm—1 for 662 keV (Verdipoor et al.,
2018). According to Bagheri et al. linear attenuation coefficients were found to be 0.133 cm—1 for 30% PbO-unsaturated polyester-nano clay composites by weight (Bagheri et al., 2018). Eren Belgin et al. reported
that the linear absorption coefficients for 662 keV gamma energy were
0.121 cm—1 and 0.124 cm—1 for 30% WO3 and 30% PbO-polyethylene composites by weight respectively (Eren Belgin and Aycik, 2015).
Mahmoud et al. calculated the linear attenuation coefficient as 0.115 cm—1 for 50% PbO-polyethylene composite by weight for 662 keV (Mahmoud et al., 2018). Bel et al. stated out that the linear attenuation
coefficient was found as 0.138 cm—1 for 662 keV by weight of 40%
Colemanite Poly (methyl methacrylate) composites (Bel et al., 2019).
3.2.Thermal degradation of poly(HEMA-co-styrene)
Thermogravimetric curves of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) and Poly (HEMA-co-Styrene) composites containing between 10 wt% and 50 wt% are shown in Fig. 11 (before radiation) and Fig. 12 (after radiation). In most cases, the thermal degradation of samples is a one-step process. The thermal stability of composites is enhanced by radiation. This may be due to breakage and cross-linking of materials identified to be one of the main bases designed for changing the internal structure of ionization radiation on polymers and thus leads to an extensive area and range of interrelated changes in physicochemical properties. This type of behaviour may cause the molecular chains of polymers to be cross- linked and cut, or even to deteriorate and break down macromole- cules, i.e. the formation of molecules with smaller chain lengths, or to may cause a change in the number or structure of the bonds(Lim et al., 1990; Shintani et al., 1991; You et al., 2013). Another noticeable feature
Fig. 10. The HVL, TVL and MFP values of Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) and Poly (HEMA-co-Styrene) tungsten(VI) composites.
is that high char yields of non-irradiated Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) com- posites in comparison with irradiated Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) ones. When we compare Tdecomposition (%20) values (that is weight loss is %
80) for all composites and neat polymers after radiation, we can see that the thermal stability of polymer composites increase with WO3. (for example, Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) is about 400 � C and (HEMA-co-S) %

50 WO3 is about 425 � C). Also, High efficiency in char formation is the reason for the strong performance of WO3 as fire retarding additives in polymer composites. It is clear that the char yields of the radiationated polymers and polymer composites are enhanced when compared with iraditionated ones.
4.Conclusions
Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene)-tungsten(VI) composites up to 50%wt were synthesized effectively by dissolving in dimethylformamide solvent after that, poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-styrene) was obtained by radical polymerization technique. Then the polymer-composites were transferred into the cups and were cured between 80 and 85 � C. The dispersing of the filler into the matrix was approved through SEM im- ages. Neither the peak shift nor the disappearance of peaks was seen in the XRD and FTIR analysis, so it is sign for the incident of the poly- merization reaction was achieved. The obtained results on linear gamma attenuation pointed out that the shielding property increased directly proportional to the amount of tungsten(VI) oxide. The HVL thicknesses of the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) 50% WO3 were 4.1 cm, 6.1 cm and 6.4 cm for 662 keV, 1173 keV and 1332 keV, respectively. These values were lower than that of the Poly(HEMA-co-Styrene) about 41%, 36%, and 36%, respectively. Thermal examinations proved that the thermal stability of the polymer composites is enhanced with irradiation and they ensued in high char yield.
