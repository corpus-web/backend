Summary
The wet impregnation method was used to prepare different ruthenium promoted Ce–Al catalysts. These catalysts were used in the steam reforming of methanol reaction (SRM). The effects of the reaction temperature (200–400 C) and the catalyst composition were studied for optimization reasons. The steam to methanol molar ratio was kept constant (S/M = 2). The promotion of cerium/aluminum oxides with Ru enhanced their catalytic activity. The catalytic test results showed that the Ru/Ce combination was the most beneficial. The synergy between Ru and cerium oxide led to the formation of active sites with excellent redox properties. For high active phase content, the 5RuCe catalyst exhibited the highest hydrogen production amount with no CO formation. This catalyst was kept under stream for 5 days at 400 C, and no significant deactivation was observed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
1 Introduction
It is a known fact that petroleum reserves are limited resources, and different studies suggested that the global peak for oil production occurred or will occur between 1996 and 2035 1. Nowadays, a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bio-energy conversion using a range of biofuels is becoming cost-wise competitive with fossil fuels 2. Because of its environmental merits, the share of biofuels in the automotive fuel market will grow fast in the next decade 3. Fuel cell powered vehicles are currently being developed by automotive industry in order to reduce the substantial diffuse emissions of CO2 and other noxious gases 4, 5. The primary fuel for these systems is hydrogen that can be supplied from liquid fuels, such as methanol via reforming processes 6-9. The steam reforming of methanol reaction (Eq. 1) is considered as the most suitable process for automotive fuel cell applications, because it occurs at moderate temperatures (200–400 C) and produces 3 moles of H2 per mole of methanol. It is a process that can provide a gas product with high hydrogen content (up to 75%) and low CO concentration (1–2%) 6.

Experimental studies on the steam reforming of methanol process focus mainly on Cu and Pd-based catalysts supported on CeO2, Al2O3 or Ce–Al 10. In the presence of Pd, methanol is mainly decomposed into H2 and CO 11-13, while Cu catalysts selectively produce H2 and CO2 in various steam reforming reactions 14-18. At only a few ppm, CO deactivates the precious metal based-anode electro-catalyst of the fuel cell. For this reason, its formation as a by-product in the reforming reactor must be avoided. Various strategies are used on both the catalytic and the conditions levels to inhibit this formation.
Ru based catalysts have shown high activity in many oxidation reactions. In their study, Over and Muhler 19 proved that a Ru catalyst shows a higher catalytic activity in an oxidizing medium compared to Pt, Rh and Pd. Lanza et al. 20 concluded that metallic Ru is active in the methane partial oxidation reaction at temperature even lower than the temperature used with oxide metals. Moreover, several authors of this manuscript showed that Ru-based catalysts are efficient in different carbon containing compounds oxidation with 100% selectivity towards CO2 formation 21-24. To our knowledge, few if any studies have considered the steam reforming of methanol over Ru/Ce–Al catalysts. Therefore, in this paper we present the results obtained for the steam reforming of methanol over Ru/Ce–Al catalysts. We also show that the prepared catalyst is stable under realistic conditions for a long period of time.
2 Material and Methods
2.1 Catalyst preparation
Ce(OH)4 was precipitated from a 0.232 mol L−1 Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution with a 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution. The resulting solid was filtered, washed and dried for 20 h at 100 C followed by calcination at 600 C in a 2 L h−1 dry air stream.
Al2O3 was synthesized by the sol–gel method similarly to 21. Al(OC4H9)3 (Fluka, ~ 11.0 wt.% Al) was dissolved in butan-2-ol (Fluka, purity ≥ 99.5%) at 85 C. Then, preheated (60 C) butan-1,3-diol, (Fluka, purity ≥ 98%) was added before hydrolysis. Hydrolysis was performed by adding water to the solution at 85 C. The gel was dried and calcined at 600 C under 75 mL min−1 of pure oxygen flow.
To prepare Ce–Al mixed oxides, an adequate aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was added (porous volume) to previously prepared Al2O3 support, then the obtained solid was dried for 20 h at 100 C followed by calcination at 600 C in a 2 L h−1 dry air stream.
Different volumes of a Ru(NO)(NO3)3 solution were added to the previously prepared supports in order to obtain catalysts with different Ru loadings. After drying at 100 C for about 20 h, catalysts were calcined under 2 L h−1 of dry air at 600 C. The obtained catalysts were designated as xRunCe10Al (x stands for the nominal Ru wt.% while n is the number of Ce atoms for 10 Al atoms in the solid).
2.2 Reaction setup and conditions
The catalysts were pelletized and sieved to obtain particles in the size range of 0.35 < dp < 0.80 mm to minimize mass transport limitations 25. A fixed volume of 0.05 cm3 of catalyst was then introduced in a quartz round bottom fixed bed reactor where the steam reforming of methanol reaction took place. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure and temperatures in the range of 200–400 C. The catalysts were pretreated in flowing argon (26 mL min−1) for 12 h before the test. The ‘water + methanol’ mixture was delivered with a peristaltic pump, and the mixture was vaporized at 150 C before entering the reactor. The water to methanol molar ratio was equal to 2 with a liquid mixture flow rate of 3.47 mL h−1. The high boiling point products and unreacted water and methanol were condensed at the exit of the reactor while dry gaseous products were analyzed online in a gas chromatograph (GC-Varian 3800) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The condensed liquid was later injected in a gas chromatograph (GC Varian 3800) equipped with a flame ionization detector.
2.3 Characterizations
The specific surface areas were determined in a Thermo-Electron QSurf M1 apparatus using the BET method. Before analysis, the samples were treated under helium flow for 30 min at 120 C. X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a BRUKER Advance D8 powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) over a 2θ range of 4° to 80° using a step size of 0.02°. Crystallite phases were determined by correlating the diffraction patterns with those in the standard powder XRD files (JCPDS). The simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetry (TG) analysis was performed on a Netzsch STA 409 apparatus. The sample was exposed to dry air and a temperature ramp of 5 C min−1 from room temperature to 1000 C. The chemical composition of the calcined catalysts was determined in an external laboratory (CNRS-Vernaison) by the inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy technique (ICP-AES). The results are listed in Table I.

3 Results and Discussion
Table I lists the specific surface areas (Ssp) of the different freshly calcined catalysts. The Ssp of the impregnated solids is lower than that of the non promoted support. This is due to the formation of ruthenium oxide clusters on the surface of the support. Moreover, for the xRunCe10Al catalysts, the specific surface areas were intermediate between the Ssp of xRuCe and the xRuAl. The higher the Ce load, the lower the Ssp of the Ce–Al containing catalyst. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns recorded for the different calcined solids. Calcined alumina is an amorphous solid that shows no diffraction peaks in the considered 2θ range. Both the 1RuAl and the 5RuAl catalysts gave XRD patterns with peaks characteristic of the tetragonal RuO2 phase (JCPDS 40-1290). These peaks are more intense for high ruthenium contents. For the CeO2 and xRuCe catalysts, diffraction peaks characteristic of the CeO2 fluorine phase are observed (JCPDS 34-0394). However, the 5RuCe catalyst XRD pattern shows two additional low intensity peaks at 35.2° and 54.4° corresponding to the RuO2 phase. The 5Ru1Ce10Al XRD pattern presented two peaks at 28.2° and 28.7° corresponding to RuO2 and CeO2 respectively. In addition the RuO2 peak at 40.1° is clear on the same pattern. For higher cerium content, 5Ru1Ce10Al, the XRD pattern is identical to the xRuCe pattern as the RuO2 peak at 28.2° is overridden by the intense CeO2 peak at 28.7°. It is also noted that all RuO2 diffraction peaks become less intense for higher cerium contents. Even though the Ssp of alumina is almost four times greater than the Ssp of ceria, it seems that ruthenium interacts with this latter and becomes better dispersed in the Ce containing solids. This is obvious from the XRD results as RuO2 diffraction peaks are absent or very small whenever the solid contains substantial amount of cerium.

This result was also found in our previous work 21, where the temperature programmed reduction analysis showed that in the presence of ceria, ruthenium oxide species are readily reduced as they are present as small well-dispersed particles at the surface of the support. This was not the case for alumina support, where ruthenium species tend to form agglomerates because of a lack of interaction with the support 21.
Table I shows the non normalized selectivity of product gases along with the activity in the steam reforming of methanol at 400 C expressed as moles of methanol converted per gram of catalyst and per minute. It is clear from the results that the addition of ruthenium catalyzes the reaction as the methanol conversion is just 13% in the presence of CeO2 while it is almost complete for 1RuCe and 5RuCe catalysts. Similarly, methanol conversion reached just 6% over alumina but increased to 42% and 77% for 1RuAl and 5RuAl respectively. For the solids containing ruthenium impregnated on cerium and aluminum mixed oxides, the conversions are fairly high but lower than those obtained with Ru/Ce solids. The catalytic activity is the highest for the 5RuCe with a 1.47 × 10−2 mol cm−3 min−1. One should keep in mind that in our tests the catalyst volume was fixed at 0.05 cm3. We could have calculated the activity per gram of catalyst but because cerium is much heavier than aluminum, the results would have been different. Practically, in industrial applications, the constraint is the catalytic bed volume. Therefore we believe that the used unit is the most suitable for the purpose of this work.
For most of the Ru containing solids, the CO selectivity was relatively high suggesting that the methanol decomposition reaction (Eq. 2) is favored at the considered temperature.

Table I also shows that for Ru/Ce–Al solids, the increase in cerium content leads to an increase in the catalytic activity and gases selectivity, but these latter remained lower than values recorded over the 1RuCe catalyst. However, over the 5RuCe catalyst and at 400 C, the percent composition of CO is too small, ~ 0.13%, compared to gases evolved in the presence of other catalysts. By careful inspection and comparison to other active catalysts, it is also noticed that the percent composition of H2 is lower while CH4 and CO2 percent compositions are substantially high. It is obvious that the water gas shift reaction (WGS) (Eq. 3) and the methanation reaction (Eq. 4) became thermodynamically favored at 400 C, and the presence of the 5RuCe catalyst made it kinetically favored. The WGS accounts for the decrease in CO and increase in CO2 quantities, while the methanation is responsible of the production of CH4 and the consumption of some of the produced H2.

To gain more insight in the performance of the 5RuCe catalyst, we tested it at four different temperatures in the methanol steam reforming reaction. Figure 2 shows the non normalized selectivity of the four evolved gases at the different temperatures. As long as the reaction temperature is ≤350 C, the H2 and CO selectivity increased with the temperature increase, the CO2 selectivity varied slightly and the CH4 production was negligible. It is only at 400 C that the WGS reaction (Eq. 3) and the methanation reaction (Eq. 4) became significant. This phenomenon is important as the produced CO quantity becomes negligible making the catalyst more promising for practical reforming where the CO may act as a poison for the fuel cells electrodes 26.

To check for optimum ruthenium loading on CeO2 delivering the above result, two additional catalysts, 2RuCe and 3RuCe, were prepared. Figure 3 shows the selectivity of the produced gases during methanol steam reforming at two different temperatures over the xRuCe catalysts. At 350 C, the four catalysts delivered similar results as the produced gas quantities were similar and methanol conversions were practically the same. At this temperature, the amount of CO produced was fairly high accompanied with small CO2 production and traces of CH4. When the temperature is increased to 400 C, and over the 1RuCe catalyst, the produced quantities of all gases increased for a higher methanol conversion.
Figure 3

However, from a ruthenium content of 2 wt.%, the WGS and the methanation reactions are favored, producing gases with a profile similar to the one obtained for 5RuCe. In a previous work on Ru/CeO2 catalysts 22, we showed that impregnating 1.65 wt.% of Ru on cerium oxide leads to the saturation of the surface with readily reducible species. These latter were responsible of the good catalytic activity of these solids in oxidation reactions. It seems that these species, with their excellent redox properties, are also responsible of the simultaneous occurrence of the WGS and the methanation reactions. While in the WGS reaction the carbon in some CO molecules is oxidized into CO2, the methanation reaction transforms another part of this carbon into a more reduced form in CH4. These redox reactions, catalyzed by the active sites in the xRuCe catalysts, consume a considerable amount of the produced CO leading to a more relevant mixture of produced gases. A complete list of catalytic results obtained for the different catalysts at different reaction temperatures is presented in Appendix A.
In order to assess the potential of the 5RuCe catalyst to be used in a realistic configuration, it was aged under stream for few days. Figure 4 shows the selectivity of the gaseous products versus time. It is evident that the catalytic activity is remarkably stable for a duration of around 5 consecutive days. The non normalized gas selectivity remained stable with negligible fluctuations. The aged catalyst was recovered, and it was subjected to simultaneous DSC and TG (result not shown). No oxidation phenomenon was observed indicating that no carbon deposition occurred during the aging test. Moreover, the XRD analysis for the spent 5RuCe catalyst showed no RuO2 diffraction peaks confirming the implication of the redox RuO2/Ru couple in the reaction.

4 Conclusions
From the results of this work, one can conclude that the association of cerium oxide to aluminum oxide did not lead to a breakthrough result compared to ceria or alumina alone. For xRuAl catalysts, the catalytic activity strongly depends on the amount of impregnated ruthenium. However, for xRuCe catalysts, an amount of 2 wt.% of ruthenium seems sufficient to produce the maximum yield in the considered reaction. The specific surface area of the support and the final catalyst did not play a major role in the catalytic activity. Moreover, a better dispersion of ruthenium oxide species was obtained in the case of CeO2 support while it had the lowest specific surface area among the considered supports. The best combination determined in this study translates into a catalyst based on ruthenium impregnated on ceria with a ruthenium loading of at least 2 wt.%. This will ensure a low CO production with acceptable conversion and H2 gas selectivity at 400 C. This catalyst is also resistant to coking and maintains a stable catalytic activity for relatively long periods of time for it to be considered for industrial applications. Several points should be addressed in coming studies, especially the variation of the reaction conditions (reactants amount, methanol to water ratio,…) and the promotion with elements that enhance the redox properties.
