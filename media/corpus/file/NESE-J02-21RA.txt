<Section>Abstract</Section>
For dismantling nuclear power plants, an underwater cutting study was conducted using a high power fiber laser. With a laser power of 9 kW, cutting tests were performed on stainless steel with a thickness of 50–100 mm. For this study, a waterproof cutting head consisting of a focusing element with a long focal length of 600 mm and a supersonic nozzle was used for high cutting efficiency. For thicknesses of 70 mm or less, it was possible to cut only with a single supersonic nozzle, while for a thickness of 80 mm or more, an initially pierced specimen or a double nozzle was required for successful cutting. Through these techniques, we were able to perform the cutting underwater up to a thickness of 100 mm. Furthermore, the kerf widths were as small as 1–2 mm, the amount of secondary waste will likely be small, which will reduce waste disposal costs.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
A number of nuclear power plants around the world have been permanently shut down due to aging and are about to be decommissioned. Most nuclear power plants operating in South Korea are pressurized water reactors, and one of them, the Kori-1 reactor, was shut down in 2017 and is being prepared to be dismantled. The primary system of the pressurized water reactor consists of a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and its internals (RVI), reactor coolant pumps (RCPs), steam generators (SGs), and so on. The most difficult task in dismantling the primary system is to dismantle the RPV and the RVI because they are composed of complex thick steel structures and are also highly radioactive. Therefore, the technologies for dismantling the RPV and the RVI need to satisfy the following requirements. First, it needs to be possible to cut at least 100 mm thick steel. Second, cutting by remote control is essential to avoid radiation exposure to human workers. Third, it must be possible to cut underwater to reduce radiation exposure with water shielding. Last, it should minimize generated secondary waste to reduce disposal costs.
Laser cutting is one of the best tools to meet these conditions. Rapid advances in laser technology have resulted in a steady increase in commercially available laser power (IPG Photonics website, 2019, Laser Focus World, 2013), enabling cutting of steels with thicknesses of tens to hundreds of millimeters. For example, cutting steels up to 300 mm with a 30 kW laser has been reported (Tamura and Ishigami, 2016). Laser cutting is also advantageous for remote control. The fiber-delivered laser beam allows the operator to work with only a small head at a distance of several tens to hundreds of meters from the laser generator. In addition, because it is non-contact type thermal cutting, the reaction force is very small so that it is easy to control the cutting head installed at a manipulator, such as a robot arm. Furthermore, laser cutting can work and requires no special maintenance. Moreover, it has a narrow kerf width on the order of 1–2 mm, resulting in less secondary waste. Despite the many advantages of the laser cutting, the high cost of the laser itself has been pointed out as a disadvantage. However, the laser prices have been rapidly falling in recent years due to the expansion of industrial applications (Industrial Laser Solutions, 2019). Therefore, the laser cutting is becoming a much more attractive tool for dismantling nuclear power plants.
To use laser cutting for dismantling tasks, researchers have studied how to cut thick steels using high power lasers. In the previous studies, cutting techniques using CO or CO2 lasers and pulsed YAG lasers, etc. have been developed (Masumoto et al., 1992, Takano et al., 1995, Alfillé et al., 1996, Choubey et al., 2015, Jain et al., 2010), but these lasers are difficult to use at the dismantling site because of difficulty in fiber delivery. Recently, cutting techniques using fiber-delivered 1-μm wavelength laser sources from a continuous wave disk or fiber lasers have been developed, and successful cutting results for thick steels using these lasers have continuously been reported (Chagnot et al., 2010, Hilton and Khan, 2014, Hilton and Khan, 2015, Leschke et al., 2016, Oh et al., 2019, Peillon et al., 2017, Seon et al., 2018, Shin et al., 2017, Shin et al., 2018a, Shin et al., 2018b, Shin et al., 2019, Tamura and Ishigami, 2016, Tamura et al., 2016, Tamura and Toyama, 2017, Tamura and Yamagishi, 2017).
Underwater laser cutting studies have also been conducted using these lasers. P. A Hilton and A. Khan cut C-Mn steel up to 37 mm thickness using a 5 kW fiber laser (Hilton and Khan, 2014, Hilton and Khan, 2015). J. Leschke et al. cut S355J2 + N steel up to 50 mm thickness using a 4 kW Yb:YAG laser (Leschke et al., 2016). J. S. Shin et al. cut the stainless steels (SUS304L) of 50 mm and 60 mm thickness using a 6-kW fiber laser (Shin et al., 2019). However, the practical application of laser cutting for dismantling nuclear power plants requires cutting thicker steel. Particularly for underwater cutting, the cutting performance for a thicker object is worse than for cutting in air. The reason is that when the cutting object is thick, buoyancy makes it difficult to produce a local-dry-zone where the laser can travel for long distances without being absorbed by water. Thus, for practical use, more advanced underwater cutting techniques are necessary for cutting thick objects of 60 mm or more.
To meet this critical demand, we performed cutting studies to cut stainless steels up to 100 mm thick. In order to overcome the buoyancy in the water, we developed and used high pressure supersonic nozzles. Moreover, a double nozzle was used for a thickness of 80 mm or more. We were able to cut stainless steel up to 100 mm thick and the obtained cutting results are summarized in this paper.
<Section>2. Experimental setup and procedure</Section>
For our underwater laser cutting studies, we used a 10-kW fiber laser system (YLS-10000, IPG Photonics Corp.) as the cutting light source. The beam from this laser system was emitted through a feeding fiber with a core diameter of 100 μm, which fed into a process fiber with a core diameter of 150 μm through a fiber-to-fiber coupler. It was delivered 20 m from the laser generator through the process fiber and entered the cutting head. This fiber laser system was initially built to drive up to 10 kW. However, the output power was limited to 9.0 kW in this study because one of the laser modules (18 modules) was out of order due to aging. Nevertheless, it was driven stably and there was no problem with its use.
Fig. 1(a) shows the design of the underwater laser cutting head applied in this work and Fig. 1(b) shows the developed underwater laser cutting head installed on the X-Y-Z stage. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the cutting head consists of a collimation lens and water-cooled parabolic and flat mirrors. The focal length of the collimation lens was 160 mm and that of the parabolic mirror was 600 mm. The parabolic mirror deflected the laser beam 30 degrees and the flat mirror deflected the beam again to form a Z-shaped optical path. This Z-shaped optical path allowed the head to remain compact even though the focal length of the parabolic mirror was as long as 600 mm. The cutting head was waterproof, allowing the head to be fully immersed in water. This head was the same one used in our previous work (Shin et al., 2019) and showed the good performance for underwater cutting.
Fig. 1. Underwater laser cutting head: (a) designed internal scheme, (b) external appearance of the head installed on the X-Y-Z stage. The cutting head was composed of a collimation lens of f = 160 mm and a parabolic mirror of f = 600 mm. It was allowed to be fully immersed in water.
The focused beam properties were measured before the cutting experiment. The diameter of the focused beam waist measured at a power of 6 kW was 584 μm at a peak intensity of 1/e2. This size was approximately equal to 563 μm, which is the geometrically calculated value form the focal lengths of the collimation lens and the parabolic mirror. The beam parameter product (BPP) and the full divergence angle were 5.418 mm∙mrad and 37.133 mrad. The Rayleigh length, half of depth of focus, was 15.717 mm. The focused beam properties were not measured at powers higher than 6 kW due to concerns about damage to the detector. The power density at the beam waist was 3.2 MW/cm2 when driven at 9.0 kW.
In addition to the focused beam properties, the ejection characteristics of the assist gas also affect the cutting performance. Therefore, the design of the nozzle structure is an important factor for effective assist gas ejection. Particularly in the case of underwater cutting, a nozzle capable of forming a local-dry-zone is necessary so that the power of the laser can be transferred to the cutting object without being absorbed by water. The nozzle also needs the ability to withstand water resistance and blow the melt well. To meet these requirements, we developed supersonic minimum length nozzles (MLNs) and applied them to the cutting head. A supersonic MLN has well-known nozzle geometry that creates a shock-wave-free gas jet (Zhang et al., 2016a, Zhang et al., 2016b, Oh et al., 2019).
For this work, two kinds of nozzles were made for applications at gauge pressures of 1.5 MPa and 2.0 MPa to avoid shock waves. Both nozzles had a throat diameter of 3 mm, and the exit diameters of 1.5 MPa and 2.0 MPa were 4.78 mm and 5.19 mm, respectively. The flow rate of the 1.5 MPa nozzle was 1310 L/min with a thermal mass flow meter. The flow rate of the 2.0 MPa nozzle was 1750 L/min inferred through the theoretical calculation because the flow rate could not be measured beyond the measurement range of our thermal mass flow meter. All flow rate values were expressed under ANR (Atmosphère Normale de Référence) conditions (20 ℃, 101.3 kPa, 65% relative humidity).
Stainless steel plates (SUS304L) with various thicknesses were used as specimens. Each specimen size was made to have a width of 120 mm and a height of 120 mm. In all the experiments, the laser power was maintained at 9.0 kW, which was the maximum power that could be generated from the laser system. Compressed air was used as the assist gas. The underwater depth at which cutting operation proceeded was 70–150 mm from the water surface. The stand-off distance, which means the distance from the nozzle exit to the front surface of the specimen, was set at 10 mm. Further reductions in the stand-off distance would result in a little better cut performances but it was kept at 10 mm for ease of manipulator operation. The focused waist of the laser beam was located 15 mm inward from the specimen front surface, which was equivalent to 25 mm outward from the nozzle exit because this condition achieves the best performance for the cutting speed with a stand-off distance of 10 mm. When calculated by considering the divergence angle and the waist diameter, the beam diameter at the nozzle exit was ~ 1.5 mm for a stand-off distance of 10 mm. And, it was ~ 1.1 mm on the front surface of the specimen. Since the nozzle exit diameter was sufficiently large compared to the laser beam size, there was no problem in forming a local-dry-zone.
Fig. 2 shows the underwater laser cutting in progress. The cutting process was as follows. First, the specimen was placed in the water tank. At this time, the cutting head was positioned above the water surface. When the cutting process started, the assist gas was applied and ejected through the nozzle to prevent the water from entering the head. Then, the head was lowered to the starting point of cutting and placed in the water. After the head was positioned at the starting point, the laser was turned on and the head was moved from the side surface of the specimen to the inner side. When the head moved a predetermined distance and the cutting was finished, the laser was turned off and the head was moved out of the water again.
Fig. 2. View of the underwater laser cutting experiment in progress. The cutting process was started after the head was completely submerged. The cutting proceeded from the side surface to the inner side.
The total length for each cut was 40 mm. The initial 10 mm section from the side surface was cut at low speed. The cutting speed of this section was defined as the “initial cutting speed.” After that, the cutting speed was increased for the remaining 30 mm section. The cutting speed of this section was defined simply as the “cutting speed.” This step-like cutting method had the effect of improving cutting performance in our previous cutting studies (Oh et al., 2019, Seon et al., 2018.; Shin et al., 2017, Shin et al., 2018a, Shin et al., 2018b, Shin et al., 2019). The cutting performance was evaluated by varying the cutting speed line by line for one specimen.
<Section>3. Single nozzle cutting</Section>
First, the underwater laser cutting was performed using the single nozzle. Table 1 lists the underwater laser cutting results with the single nozzle, and Fig. 3 shows the maximum cutting speed against the thickness. When the assist gas with a gauge pressure of 1.5 MPa was applied, the cutting was well performed up to a thickness of 70 mm without any problems. The maximum cutting speeds at thicknesses of 50, 60 and 70 mm were 180, 110, 80 mm/min, respectively. Compared to the results with a 6 kW laser in our previous work (Shin et al., 2019), the 9 kW laser power resulted in much a better performance in terms of cutting speed. In our previous work (Shin et al., 2019), the maximum cutting speeds of stainless steel with thicknesses of 50 and 60 mm for application of 6 kW power were 80 and 40 mm/min, respectively. In this study, the cutting speeds with 9 kW laser power were more than doubled that with the 6 kW power, and the performance improvement by increasing the power was greater for thicker specimens. At this time, the applied initial cutting speeds were 10 mm/min for thicknesses of 50 and 60 mm and 5 mm/min for a thickness of 70 mm.

The results for the case where the cutting failed in the initial 10 mm section and the cutting was successful for the remaining section are also plotted on the graph.

When the thickness increased to more than 70 mm, the specimens were not cut well, especially in the initial 10 mm section although the head moved at a low cutting speed of 5 mm/min. As listed in Table 1 (Test No. 4–1 and 4–2), initial cuts failed for the 80 mm thickness with the assist gas at a gauge pressure of 1.5 MPa. Increasing the gauge pressure of the assist gas to 2.0 MPa also did not result in good initial cuts. Sometimes the initial cut succeeded (Test No. 4–3) and sometimes it failed (Test No. 4–4). Nevertheless, the cutting was done well after the laser beam had completely penetrated the specimen past the initial cutting section. The maximum cutting speed for the 80 mm thickness was 40 mm/min with a gauge pressure of 1.5 MPa. For a gauge pressure of 2.0 MPa, the maximum cutting speed for the 80 mm thickness was slightly lowered to 30 mm/min. However, no accurate comparison of the results was possible due to the effects of poor initial cutting. Initial cuts also failed for the 90 mm thickness but the cuttings were done well after the initial cuts. In this case, the maximum cutting speed was 20 mm/min with a gauge pressure of 2.0 MPa.
There were several reasons why initial cuts were not successful. Firstly, the cutting started from the side surface of the specimen because this part was open and the assist gas did not blow the melt well. This phenomenon was observed even when cutting in air, but was mostly solved by slowing down the initial cutting speed. However, in underwater cutting, simply lowering the cutting speed did not solve the initial cutting problem due to the high resistance of the surrounding water. The second reason was that buoyancy in the water caused the assist gas to move upward, preventing the laser beam from reaching the rear side of the specimen. In that case, near the rear side of the specimen, it could not directly absorb the power of the laser beam. Factors that degraded the performance of the initial cuts worked better as the thickness of the cut increased. In cutting with a single nozzle, the initial cutting problem for the specimens over 70 mm thick was not overcome by increasing the gauge pressure of the assist gas to 2.0 MPa, the maximum pressure applicable in our laser cutting system.
On the other hand, if the cutting object was already pierced by a mechanical drill or the like, the initial cutting problem would not need to be considered. It would be very easy to blow out the melt with the assist gas because the air flow passage was already formed through the pierced hole along the thickness direction of the specimen. In addition, the local-dry-zone for the laser passage was well formed inside the pierced hole so that it would not have to take into account the performance degradation by buoyancy. The effect of using pierced specimens was discussed in our previous work (Shin et al., 2019). Therefore, we used pierced specimens to eliminate the effect of poor cutting performance due to initial cut failure. Fig. 4 compares the initial cuts for 80 mm thick specimens. In the general non-pierced specimen, the initial cutting failed (Test No. 5–1), whereas applying the pierced specimen confirmed that the initial cutting problem was solved (Test No. 7–1).
Fig. 4. Comparison of the initial cuts for 80 mm thickness between pierced and non-pierced specimens: (a) cut shapes of the front and the rear surfaces when the initial cut was successful with the pierced specimen (Test No. 7–1), (b) cut shapes of the front and the rear surfaces when the initial cut failed with the non-pierced specimen (Test No. 5–1). The circled area is the part that failed the initial cut.
Table 2 lists the underwater laser cutting results with the pierced specimens. In this case, an assist gas with a gauge pressure of 1.5 MPa was used, and the hole diameter of the pierced specimens was 8 mm. With the pierced specimens, the initial cuts were successfully done as expected. The stainless steel up to 100 mm thick could be cut at 9.0 kW laser power. With a 100 mm thickness, the cutting length was reduced to 30 mm because of the large consumption of the assist gas. The maximum speeds for the pierced specimens is shown in Fig. 3. For the 80, 90, 100 mm thicknesses, the maximum cutting speed was 50, 30, 7 mm/min, respectively. Using the pierced specimen, the cutting performance was improved even when compared to the case of the non-pierced specimen applying the assist gas with a higher gauge pressure of 2.0 MPa.
Table 2. The underwater laser cutting results for the pierced specimens with the single nozzle.
In addition to the maximum cutting speed, another important factor in cutting performance is the kerf width. The amount of secondary waste generation can be estimated from the kerf width. A narrow kerf width is necessary to minimize secondary waste, and a small amount of secondary waste reduces the cost of waste disposal in dismantling nuclear power plants. Table 3 lists the results of kerf widths with the single nozzle according to thickness at maximum cutting speeds. The front kerf widths were 1.3–1.6 mm and the rear kerf widths were 1.5–1.8 mm. For all cases, the kerf widths were narrow in the 1–2 mm range. The rear kerf width was almost the same or slightly larger than the front kerf width. This was because the size of the focused laser beam did not increase significantly over a long distance from the beam waist with the application of a focusing element with a long focal length of 600 mm.
Table 3. Results for kerf widths with the single nozzle according to thickness at maximum cutting speeds.
Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the shapes of the cut specimens obtained at the corresponding maximum cutting speed for the cases where the cutting was successful. Fig. 5(a), (b) and (c) show the cut shapes for thicknesses of 50, 60 and 70 mm, respectively. Fig. 6(a), (b) and (c) show the cut shapes for thicknesses of 80, 90 and 100 mm, respectively, when pierced specimens were used. The dross-removed cut shapes are also shown in Fig. 6. Because it was in the form of oxide, the dross attached on the rear surface was easily removed with a weak force. As shown in the figures, a slightly curved portion of the kerf was observed for some cases, because fluctuation of the cutting head occurred by the swell due to the strong ejection of the assist gas. However, the cutting was successful even to a thickness of 100 mm. The fluctuation of the head was expected to disappear with the application of a more robust manipulator.

<Section>4. Double nozzle cutting</Section>
Previous experiments with a single nozzle have shown that using pierced specimens can cut stainless steel up to 100 mm thick at 9 kW laser power. Therefore, if the initial cut was successful, it would be expected to cut up to 100 mm for non-pierced normal specimens as well. The use of a double nozzle was expected to improve the initial cutting performance. The gas ejected from the secondary nozzle acted as a protective barrier to allow the primary gas jet to extend well without being affected by buoyance. Therefore, the local-dry-zone was formed over the thickness of the specimen so that the laser beam could reach the back side of the specimen without water absorption. This gave the effect of better initial cutting compared to using a single nozzle. For this purpose, underwater laser cutting experiments were performed using a double nozzle that added a secondary nozzle to a primary nozzle.
Fig. 7(a) shows the conceptual scheme of laser cutting using a double nozzle, and Fig. 7(b) shows the assist gas ejection from the primary and secondary nozzles in water. The nozzle exit diameter of the secondary nozzle was 12 mm. The stand-off distance was 4 mm for the secondary nozzle and 10 mm for the primary nozzle. The secondary nozzle was configured to have the gas applied independently of the primary nozzle. During the cutting experiments, the secondary nozzle gas inlet was supplied with compressed air with a gauge pressure of 1.0 MPa, and the flow rate was controlled through a valve. The maximum flow rate that could be applied was 1000 L/min.
Fig. 7. (a) Conceptual scheme of laser cutting using a double nozzle, (b) view of the assist gas ejection from both the primary and the secondary nozzles in water.
Table 4 lists the underwater laser cutting results with the double nozzle and Fig. 8 shows the maximum cutting speed against the thickness using the double nozzle. For 80 mm thickness, the maximum cutting speed was 50 mm/min with assist gas of 1.5 MPa gauge pressure (Test No. 10–2). This was the same result as with the pierced specimen. At this time, the secondary gas flow rate was 650 L/min. For a 90 mm thickness, the gauge pressure of 1.5 MPa was not enough for successful initial cutting (Test No. 11–1 and 11–2). Thus, it was increased to 2.0 MPa. However, even with an increased assist gas pressure, the initial cutting was still not good (Test No. 12–1). Therefore, the secondary gas flow was increased to 830 L/min. This resulted in a good initial cut and a maximum cutting speed of 20 mm/min (Test No. 12–2). For 100 mm thickness, the secondary gas flow was further increased to 1000 L/min. In this case of 100 mm thickness, the cutting length was also reduced to 30 mm because of the large consumption of the assist gas. The maximum cutting speed was 10 mm/min (Test No. 13–1). As shown in Fig. 8, the results for all thicknesses show that the maximum cutting speed was similar to when the pierced specimen was used. Therefore, it was confirmed that the cutting was done well even for a thickness of more than 70 mm, as the initial cutting was improved by using the double nozzle. With the double nozzle a thickness of 100 mm at 9.0 kW laser power can be cut.

Table 5 lists the results of the kerf widths with the double nozzle according to the thickness at maximum cutting speeds. The front kerf widths were 1.5–1.7 mm and the rear kerf widths were 1.8–1.9 mm. In the results with the double nozzle, the kerf widths were also narrow in the 1–2 mm range. Fig. 9(a), (b) and (c) show the cut shapes for thicknesses of 80, 90 and 100 mm at the corresponding maximum cutting speeds when the double nozzle was used. The cuts were successful to a thickness of 100 mm.

<Section>5. Conclusions</Section>
In summary, an underwater cutting study was performed using a fiber laser with a power of 9 kW to achieve cutting of stainless steel up to 100 mm thick. For a thickness of 70 mm or less, cutting was performed well by applying only a single nozzle. However, for thicker specimens of 80 mm or more, the stainless steel was cut using a single nozzle only where it was initially mechanically pierced. For that case, it was possible to cut up to a thickness of 100 mm. The use of the double nozzle allowed cutting of 80 mm or more thickness for non-pierced stainless steel. For that case, the stainless steel plates were also cut up to a thickness of 100 mm.
In general, laser cutting is known to cut 10 mm of steel per kW in air (Chagnot et al., 2010). However, in an underwater environment, the cutting efficiency is inevitably reduced due to various reasons mentioned in the introduction section. Nevertheless, in this study we were able to cut underwater up to 100 mm using a laser power of 9 kW. This was cut at 11.1 mm per kW, which is only possible in air in typical laser cutting operations. Therefore, the performance of our cutting head can be evaluated as excellent. In this study, the laser power was limited to 9 kW, but it is expected that if a laser with a higher power of 20–30 kW is applied, 100 mm thickness can be cut under water with much faster speed. In addition, it is expected that such a high power laser can cut even 200–300 mm thicknesses underwater. This makes laser cutting possible for most of the structures that make up nuclear power plants.
Additionally, based on the results of this study, we proposed an effective method for applying underwater laser cutting to actual dismantling sites of nuclear power plants. The method is effective for piercing a thick object to be cut with a mechanical drill before laser cutting. The degree to which the object is judged to be thick varies depending on the laser power, but a very high cutting performance improvement is expected from initial piercing. If there are holes that originally exist in the cutting object, the same effect can be seen by starting cutting from there. However, when initial piercing is not possible, a double nozzle or a triple nozzle should be used to cut a thick object. The double nozzle used in this study had a considerable flow consumption because the secondary nozzle was not optimized. The flow rate ejected from the primary nozzle and the secondary nozzle to cut a 100 mm thick specimen was 2750 L/min. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimized secondary nozzle that will reduce the consumption of assist gas.
