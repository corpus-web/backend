Abstract
We present a simplified, automatable single-column radiochemical separation method using the extraction chromatographic branched-DGA resin for the production of no-carrier-added 86Y with a radiochemical yield higher than 95%, an apparent molar activity of 1.4 ± 0.4 Ci/μmol (DOTA) and 2.3 ± 0.7 Ci/μmol (DTPA), and a run-to-run recycling efficiency of the isotopically-enriched target of 98 ± 1%. These results enable the preparation of 86Y radiopharmaceuticals for 86Y/90Y-based cancer theranostic applications.

1. Introduction
Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) for the treatment of cancer is rapidly gaining momentum in the US and Europe. Of several β--emitting isotopes employed in TRT, 90Y plays an essential role thanks to its favorable chemical and dosimetric properties. Increasingly widespread utilization of 90Y motivates the use of the β+-emitter 86Y as an imaging surrogate in theranostic applications. Being chemically identical to 90Y, the incorporation of 86Y (t1/2 = 14.7 h, 66% EC, 34% β+, Eβ+max = 3.2 MeV) into existing 90Y-labeled radiopharmaceuticals is seamless and allows for the noninvasive investigation of the pharmacokinetic profile, tissue distribution, and radiation dosimetry of these compounds with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (Qaim and Spahn, 2017; Rösch et al., 2017; Aluicio-Sarduy et al., 2018). To date, several methods for the production of 86Y have been investigated (Qaim and Spahn, 2017, Rösch et al., 2017, Baimukhanova et al., 2018). Among them, cyclotron production based on the 86Sr(p,n)86Y nuclear reaction has proven the most feasible route to obtain 86Y with high radionuclidic and radiochemical purities. This route requires isotopically enriched 86Sr (see Qaim and Spahn, 2017 and references therein), necessitating recycling of the expensive target material. In this work, we report a novel method that employs solid-phase extraction chromatography using a DGA resin to efficiently isolate 86Y from enriched 86SrCO3 targets, which significantly improves the radiochemical yield and provides 86Y with apparent molar activities amenable to the radiolabeling of small molecules, nanoparticles, and antibodies for preclinical imaging of cancer. Importantly, near-quantitative recovery (98 ± 1%) of 86SrCO3 is also achieved.
2. Materials and methods
Ultra-pure reagents were used for the radiochemical separation process and the recovery of the target material: Optima grade HCl and HNO3 were purchased from Fisher Scientific; puratronic grade (NH4)2CO3 (99.999%) was from Alfa Aesar; and isotopically enriched 86SrCO3 (96.40%) was obtained from Isoflex. All solutions were prepared using 18 M Ohm cm water. To ensure metal-free surfaces, the glassware and tools were washed with Alconox, treated with 1 M HNO3, rinsed with 18 M Ohm cm water, and dried in an oven at 120 °C.
2.1. Target and bombardment
86Y was produced using a 16 MeV GE PETtrace cyclotron via the nuclear reaction 86Sr(p,n)86Y from enriched 86SrCO3 targets covering the energy range Ep = 14.1–7.1 MeV. Before irradiation, the 86SrCO3 powder was pressed (250 kg/cm2) into a niobium crucible, which was covered with a 12.7 µm thick niobium foil to confine the target material and degrade the entrance energy of the proton beam to 14.1 MeV. With direct water-jet cooling on the back of the niobium crucible, typical irradiations were performed at currents of 5 μA for up to 2 h.
2.2. Separation of 86Y from the 86SrCO3 targets
Following irradiation, the targets were allowed to decay for 4 h to reduce co-produced, short-lived 86mY (t1/2: 48 min) in the final product. The target material was then dissolved in 5 mL of 9 M HCl, and the separation of 86Y from the irradiated 86SrCO3 was carried out by single column extraction chromatography column using a resin functionalized with N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-2-ethylhexyldiglycolamide (branched DGA, Eichrom). The target solution was loaded onto the DGA column, and subsequent washes were performed using 9 M HCl (15 mL) and 0.5 M HNO3 (15 mL) to remove the bulk strontium and traces of other metallic impurities. The no-carrier-added 86Y was quantitatively eluted from the column with 0.1 M HCl (4 × 0.3 mL). All load, rinse, and elution solutions were passed over the column using a peristaltic pump flowing at 1.6 mL/min. The activity was assayed in a Capintec CRC-15R dose calibrator (setting #850/2)
2.3. Chemical and radiochemical analysis
Nuclear reactions, radiochemical yields, and the presence of radionuclidic impurities were evaluated by gamma-ray spectrometry using a calibrated high purity germanium (HPGe) detector (1.9 keV FWHM at 1333 keV). Trace metal analysis of the final eluate was performed by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES) using an Agilent 4200 spectrometer. Typical detection limits of this technique vary by element and are sub-ppm for transition metals.
2.4. Apparent molar activity measurements
The apparent molar activity was determined by titrimetric complexation of the purified 86Y with varying concentrations of DOTA and DTPA chelators (Yoo et al., 2005). Briefly, 100 µL aliquots of diluted 86Y stock solution (100 µCi at the end of bombardment; EOB) were added to vials containing 50 µL of 0.5 M NaOAc buffer solution (pH = 4.5). Increasing concentrations of DOTA and DTPA (100 µL, 0–100 µg/mL) in water were added to the vessels, which were then vortexed and incubated for 60 min at 80 °C and room temperature, respectively. The percentage of the radionuclide complexed in each sample was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates run using 1:1 MeOH:10% NH4OAc (w/v) as mobile phase. Evaluation of the TLC plates was performed by autoradiography on a Packard Cyclone phosphor-storage plate. The retention factor of free 86Y was 0 and chelated 86Y-DOTA/DTPA was 1.
2.5. Recovery of the enriched target material
After separating the 86Y activity, the recovery of the enriched target material was performed via a series of precipitation/decantation steps in saturated (NH4)2CO3 solutions (Rösch et al., 1993). Briefly, the 86Sr contained in the 9 M HCl eluted fractions (load and rinse) was precipitated as carbonate by dropwise addition of freshly prepared solution of saturated (NH4)2CO3, until no more precipitate formation was observed. Afterward, the 86SrCO3 was separated by centrifugation and dried at 120 °C in inert gas atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Irradiation and production yield
The original energy of the proton beam was 16 MeV, but the beam energy was degraded to 14.1 MeV after passing the Nb foil target window. To minimize decomposition of the target material, irradiations were performed by slowly increasing the beam current to the desired value. Production runs lasted an average of 2 h at proton currents up to 5μA. No apparent damage to the Nb window encasing the target material was observed, and an 86Y production yield of 0.11 ± 0.02 GBq/μA h (n = 3) was obtained after irradiating 130–160 mg/cm2 86SrCO3 targets, a physical yield that is comparable to prior literature report. At beam intensities > 5 µA, scorching of the target 86SrCO3 was visible, so beam intensities were limited to 5 µA thereafter.
3.2. Separation of 86Y from 86Sr
Fig. 1a depicts the separation strategy employed for the radiochemical isolation of 86Y using a single branched-DGA extraction chromatography column. The branched DGA resin was selected instead of the normal DGA because large volumes of diluted HCl were required to elute 86Y from the latter (Fig. S1) (Pawlak et al., 2013). Owing to the differential affinity of Sr2+ and Y3+ ions for the branched DGA resin at varied hydrochloric acid concentrations, the selective loading of the Y3+ ions from the 9 M HCl solutions used for target dissolution was possible (Horwitz et al., 2005). The poor retention of Sr2+ ions allowed the collection of the bulk target material as effluent during the column loading and subsequent 15 mL 9 M HCl washing steps. Load and wash eluents were preserved for later recovery of the expensive 86SrCO3. Additionally, low affinity (Kd < 10) metal impurities such as Cu were also partially eluted at this step (Horwitz et al., 2005).

Next, the column was washed with 0.5 M HNO3 to elute trace metal impurities of Fe, Zn, and the remaining Cu (Fig. 1b). The removal of these metal impurities is crucial to achieve high radiolabeling yields, particularly when promiscuous chelating agents such as DOTA or DTPA are employed. An affinity constant lower than 2 for all these metals over a wide range of HNO3 concentrations allows their quantitative removal with this rinse (Horwitz et al., 2005, Pourmand and Dauphas, 2010). However, the lowest 0.5 M HNO3 was selected to reduce the acidity of the final eluate while avoiding 86Y activity losses during the wash.
Finally, the resin's relatively lower affinity (Kd ~ 50) for 86Y in dilute HCl (0.1 M) was leveraged to elute 86Y in a small volume (≤ 600 µL) with a resulting separation factor of 105, and a radiochemical yield of 96 ± 2% (n = 3).
3.3. Radionuclidic and chemical impurities
The isotopic composition of the enriched 86Sr target (0.01% 84Sr; 96.4% 86Sr; 1.33% 87Sr; and 2.28% 88Sr) influences the radionuclidic purity of the final product. For a 2 h irradiation, the major radionuclidic impurities relative to the 86Y activity at EOB were 86mY (173%), 87Y (0.22%), 87mY (1.7%), and 88Y (0.1%). A cooling period of 4 h after EOB allowed for the decay of 86mY (99.31% branching ratio to 86Y). Following subsequent radiochemical separation, the radioisotopic impurities relative to the 86Y activity at the end of chemistry EOC (ca. 5 h post-EOB) were 2.87% 86mY, 0.27% 87Y, 1.62 87mY and 0.12% 88Y, measured by γ-ray spectrometry (Fig. 2).

The levels of Sr and other common metals affecting the 86Y apparent molar activity, including Zn, Fe, and Cu, were determined by MP-AES to be 2.04 ± 1.79 ppm, 0.20 ± 0.19 ppm, 0.15 ± 0.10 ppm, and 0.05 ± 0.03 ppm, respectively (n = 3). The ppm levels of Sr found in the final eluate are a product of the co-loading of a small fraction of the target material at high HCl concentrations. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this metal contamination had a negligible effect on the determined 86Y apparent molar activities for complexation with common chelators. Conversely, the efficient removal of other metallic contaminants (aka. Zn, Fe, and Cu) played a crucial role in the observed radiolabeling yields, as most of the used ligands have high thermodynamic stability constants with these metals. As we discuss in the next section, these metallic impurities were present at levels that did not affect the high chemical reactivity of the produced 86Y.
3.4. Apparent molar activity with DOTA and DTPA chelators
Titrimetric reactions with chelators such as DOTA or DTPA is a conventional method for determining the reactivity of radiometals (McCarthy et al., 1997, Yoo et al., 2005). Since these chelators are non-specific and effectively form complexes with many metal ions (Byegård et al., 1999), this method provides practical information about the “chemical” purity of the radionuclide-containing solution.
The 86Y apparent molar activity determined by titration of [86Y]YCl3 solutions with DOTA and DTPA, expressed as the ratio of activity of 86Y over twice the number moles of chelator required to reach 50% complexation, was determined to be 1.4 ± 0.4 Ci/μmol and 2.3 ± 0.7 Ci/µmol with DOTA and DTPA, respectively (n = 3). Such a high chemical purity, which mirrors that of therapeutic 90Y-labeled compounds, confirm the suitability of the produced 86Y for the chelation of bifunctional molecules for potential theranostic applications.
3.5. Recovery of the target material
The isotopically-enriched target material was recycled with a run-to-run efficiency of 98 ± 1% (n = 3). Strontium contained in the 9 M HCl fractions (load + 15 mL wash) was quantitatively precipitated as 86SrCO3 by adding of a saturated (NH4)2CO3 solution. If handling and transferring of powdered 86SrCO3 is done with extreme care the losses of the target material are minimized.
3.6. Comparison with previous isolation strategies
Over the last few decades, several methods for the separation of 86Y from Sr-based targets (mainly from enriched 86SrCO3) have been reported or reviewed and are summarized in Table 1 (Qaim and Spahn, 2017, Rösch et al., 2017). They include co-precipitation and ion exchange (Rösch et al., 1993, Kettern et al., 2002), electrolysis (Reischl et al., 2002, Yoo et al., 2005, Lukić et al., 2009), single column chromatography (Kandil et al., 2009, Medvedev et al., 2011), multiple column chromatography (Garmestani et al., 2002, Park et al., 2004, Sadeghi et al., 2009a, Sadeghi et al., 2009b), solvent extraction and precipitation of the 86Y (Avila-Rodriguez et al., 2008, Kandil et al., 2009, Sadeghi et al., 2010). Typically, these methods require multiple steps, making them time-consuming and difficult to automate. Our method obtains the highest radiochemical yield reported so far, with a chemical purity and apparent molar activity of 86Y that is at least comparable to other reported values and amenable to radiopharmaceutical formulation. The speed, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of this method make it very attractive for the separation of no-carrier-added 86Y from 86Sr-based targets and dispose our method to automated approaches.

4. Conclusion
To our knowledge, the use of branched DGA extraction resin to separate 86Y from cyclotron irradiated 86SrCO3 targets, enables the highest radiochemical purity and apparent molar activity yet reported for 86Y productions using potentially automatable column extraction chromatography. These results have led to the successful preparation of 86Y formulations with total injected masses that are tolerable in applications of 86Y as a PET imaging surrogate of 90Y radiopharmaceuticals.
