Abstract:
Thirty liters of highly acidic spent nuclear fuelsolutions need to be disposed at the “Hot Laboratory (hotlab)” facility in Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Switzerland.In order to significantly reduce the γ dose rate before proper disposal treatment, 137Cs must be removed. In the here presented sub-project, the ion-exchange method wasevaluated. Two promising sorbents, CLEVASOL® and AMP(ammonium molybdophosphate), and two derived products AMP_PAN (AMP immobilized in polyacrylonitrile)and AMP/SiO2 (AMP immobilized on silica gel) were testedby the batch method using model solutions of importanthigh-yield fission products (Cs, Eu, Zr, Ru, Pd and Ag), as well as U and Pu. The results showed that AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN have higher selectivity for Cs thanCLEVASOL® in 0.1–8 M (mol/L) HNO3 solutions. 4 M HNO3 solution was identified as the most suitable condition forCs-removal with AMP, AMP_PAN and AMP/SiO2  due to the still sufficiently high separation factor of Cs from other metal ions and an acceptable volume increase factor after dilution. The follow-up kinetic studies on AMP, AMP_PAN and AMP/SiO2 indicated that although Cs exchange onAMP and AMP/SiO2 is faster than on AMP_PAN in the first 5  min, they all nearly reach equilibrium after 30  min of contacting time. The isotherm curves ofCs adsorption on AMP, AMP_PAN and AMP/SiO2  in 4 M HNO3  showed that the maximum sorption capacity of Cs is reached asymptotically. The results from Langmuir isotherm modeling agree with results from other publications.

1 Introduction
Due to several previous analytical studies, a total amount of 700 g spent nuclear fuel, from Swiss nuclear power plants, were dissolved in approximately 30 liters 8–10  M HNO3.
Now they have to be conditioned for final disposal. The specific composition of these solutions varies from batch to batch. For conditioning and final cementation, these solutions should be treated in “Fixbox 3” (a new facilityfor the conditioning of radioactive waste) in the “Hot Laboratory” (hotlab), at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). However, the high γ dose rate generated by these solutions are preventing the direct treatment. Thus, a pre-separation of high-dose rate emitters is needed. The cesium isotope 137Cs (T1/2 = 30.08 years) is one of the high-yield fission products from 235U fission [1] and exists in these solutions in a considerable amount. Numerous Cs-removal techniques have been developed and investigated in the past, including precipitation [2], solvent extraction [3, 4] and ion-exchange [5, 6]. Ion-exchange with packed column operation has been widely used in this field due to operational simplicity. Various Ion-exchangers are synthesized to selectively remove radioactive Cs with fast exchange kinetics and high exchange capacity [7, 8]. However, most of them are not applicable in highly acidic solution. For instance, the commercially available sorbent “Cs-treat®” was decomposing already in 2 M HNO3  in pilot studies. Two sorbents for Csremoval, CLEVASOL® and Ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) that are more promising to stand the harsh environment were tested in this work. A description of the entire waste treatment procedure is given in [9]. CLEVASOL®, a novel inorganic ion-exchanger, is marketed by ADePhine GmbH. This sorbent is a grey powder consisting of a microporous, inorganic, metal-free polymer [10]. It can be directly used for column operation due to its sufficiently large particle size [10]. The pilot batch tests showed that Cs has high affinity to this sorbent and the ion-exchange process reaches equilibrium within 5 min of contacting time. The titration test showed that it has a high exchange capacity of 5.4 ± 0.2 meq/g [10]. CLEVASOL® is stable in 3 M HCl at 95 °C and it still shows >90 % of its exchange capacity after receiving an integral dose of 107  Gy from a 60Co γ source. The formed Cs salt did not decompose even by heating to 810 °C, which showed that the formed compound has a high thermal stability [10]. AMP is a yellow, crystalline inorganic compound. The molybdophosphate complex ion [PMo12O40]3− consists of one PO4 3− group surrounded by 12 MoO3 groups, and the ammonium ions are associated with the molybdophosphate complex [11]. The exchange of ammonium ions with Cs is more preferred than for other monovalent cations in acidic medium [11, 12], which was confirmed by other researchers [13–17]. Dolezal et  al. claimed that a maximum of approximately 60 % of ammonium ions can be exchanged with Cs [18], which indicates a high exchange capacity of Cs on AMP. Rao et  al. demonstrated no significant effect on exchange capacity of AMP to Cs after receiving 2 MGy of dose from electron irradiation [19], suggesting a good radiation stability.The ion-exchange mechanism of Cs on AMP is known to be isomorphous exchange of Cs ions with ammonium ions in the crystal lattice [13]. Van and Smit discovered that ammonium ions can be replaced by alkali metal ions and a more stable structure is formed when exchanging with larger monovalent ions. According to Van and Smit (1958), the phosphomolybdate complex ion, [PMo12O40]3−, consists of a hollow sphere formed by the 12 MoO3 octa edra, with the PO43− group in the center. The large cations with associated water molecules are more fitting in these spheres of negative complex ions [12]. The Cs ion is large enough to fit into these spheres to form a more stable and insoluble structure in acidic medium [20].AMP seems to be promising in removing radioactive Cs from acidic solutions, but it is difficult to apply AMP in column operation due to its microcrystalline structure with particle sizes in the range of 1–5 μm [21].These small particles are impe vious to liquid. In order to solve this problem, AMP can be immobilized on inert supporting materials. Over the p st 40  years, various approaches to immobilize AMP on an acceptable support matrix for column operation have been investigated, including alumina [22], zirconium phosphate[23], polyacrylonitrile [24–28], and porous silica gel[29–31]. Sebesta et al. developed a mechanically durablecompound by binding AMP with polyacrylonitrile (PAN)[24, 25]. Other studies have successfully made use ofAMP_PAN to remove radioactive Cs from laundry wastewater, seawater and acidic nuclear waste [26–28]. Others investigated the possibility to immobilize AMP on silica gel (SiO2) to produce a more stable form. Their resultsshowed that AMP/SiO2 is a potentially efficient material for Cs-removal [18, 29–31]. Within the present study, we aimed to apply the two ion-exchangers, CLEVASOL® and AMP for our specific separation task. The latter was also tested in two different immobilized forms, AMP_PAN and AMP/SiO2 .
The main motivation was to select the best-suited material and determine the most suitable method considering the specific boundary conditions of the high acidity of the solutions. To accomplish the task, batch tests with model solutions were conducted to evaluate the exchange properties, including distribution coefficients (Kd), separation factors (αA/B), kinetics and practical specific capacities. The “practical specific capacity” was defined by Samuelson in 1970 as “total amount of ions expressed in milliequivalents or millimoles taken up per gram of dry ion exchanger under specified conditions(should always be given together with specificationof conditions)” [32]. In the study of distribution coefficients, the stock solutions containing radioisotopes(137Cs, 152Eu, 235U, 238U, 239Pu) and stable metal ions (Zr4+,Ru3+, Pd2+ and Ag+) were used. In the study of kinetics, the stock solutions containing either 137Cs or mixture of 137Cs and stable Cs were used. In the study of practical specific capacities, the  tock solutions containing mixture of 137Cs and stable Cs were used.
2 Experimental
Unless specially stated, nitric acid was prepared by mixing Milli-Q water (resistivity of 18 MΩ cm) and 65 % of wt. % HNO3  (JT. Baker). AMP_PAN was purchased fromthe company TRISKEM and CLEVASOL® was provided by ADePhine GmbH. All data obtained in this paper are from experiments performed in duplicates. The temperature was kept at 22 ± 1 °C.
2.1 Preparation of AMP/SiO2
The procedure of preparing AMP/SiO2  was adapted from other works [29–31] in slightly modified form. The AMP compound is known to be easily decomposed in basic solution [14] and thus ammonia solution was used to dissolve AMP with the addition of silica gel support. First, 6.9 g of AMP and 6.3 g of silica gel (pore size 150 Å, 200–425 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) were weighed on a digital balance (Sartorius, 98648-018-34), and added into a 500  mL of container containing 175  mL of 25 % ammonia solution (J.T. Baker). This mixture was stirred overnight with a magnetic stirrer (Heidolph MR HeiStandard) at 300  rpm. Later excessive ammonia was evaporated by heating the mixture for several hours to70 °C with a heating plate (Heidolph MR Hei-Standard). Afterwards, 15 mL of 6 M HNO3 were added to the container to re-precipitate ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP). The re-precipitated AMP was successfully immobilized on the silica gel. This product was left standing in a ventilated fume hood for 2 days until dry after removing the aqueous phase by filtration with a filter paper (Whatman™). Finally, the dry AMP/SiO2  powder was obtained and transferred into a suitable container.
2.2 Preparation of stock solutions
The stock solutions prepared for the studies were labelled as No. 1–9. Stock solutions No. 1–3 used to measure distribution coefficients were model solutions. Several elements representing high-yield fission products (Cs, Eu, Ru, Zr, Ag and Pd) [1], as well as U and Pu as matrix elements were added. The stock solution No. 1 contained trace amounts of 137Cs and 152Eu in different concentrations of HNO3 (0.1–8 M). The stock solution No. 2 contained stable Zr, Ru, U and Pu in different concentrations of HNO3 (0.1–8 M). The stock solutions No. 3 contained stable Pd and Ag in different concentrations of HNO3  (0.1–8 M).
The stock solution No. 4 consisted of 4 M HNO3  and trace amounts of 137Cs.
The stock solutions labelled as No. 5–9 were prepared by dissolving a weighed amount of CsNO3  and spiking with 137Cs tracer in 4 M HNO3 .
The chemicals used for the preparation of stock solutions and the concentration of solutes in stock solutions were shown in Table 1, and measurement technique and stock solution used in each study were shown in Table 2.

3 Distribution coefficient (Kd)studies with different HNO3 concentration
The weighed sorbent (10  mg for CLEVASOL®, AMP andAMP/SiO2 ; 40  mg for AMP_PAN) and 2  mL of the stock solution were added into a 3.5 mL glass vial. These vials were immediately shaken for 4  h by a shaking machine (IKA® VIBRAX VXR basic), at 1500  rpm. Afterwards, the aqueous phase in each vial was separated from the solid phase by rapid filtration on syringe filters (0.1 μm pore size for AMP and AMP/SiO2 , Whatman™; 2 μm pore size for CLEVASOL® and AMP_PAN, Miller®). One milliliter of the separated aqueous phase and 1 mL of the corresponding stock solution were measured by γ-ray spectrometry with a high purity germanium γ detector (HPGe), or InductivelyCoupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)/InductivelyCoupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) to quantify the count rate of γ emitters or the concentration of each investigated element, respectively.
4 Kinetic studies
Two milliliter of stock solution (No. 4 or No. 9) and weighed sorbent (10 mg for AMP and AMP/SiO2 ; 40 mg for AMP_ PAN) were added into a 3.5 mL glass vial and these vials were shaken for different time intervals (10 s to 4 h) by a shaking machine at 1500  rpm. After reaching the preset time interval, the aqueous phase in each vial was immediately separated from the solid phase by syringe filters. The phases were separated in less than 2 s in case of <300 s contact time and within 10 s when the contacting time was300 s to 4 h. The uncertainty of the contacting time was in a range of 0.5 %–20 %, respectively. Finally, 1 mL of the separated aqueous phase in each vial and 1 mL of stock solution were measured by means of γ-ray spectrometry to quantify the count rate of 137Cs.
5 Practical specific capacity studies
A series of batch tests were conducted to quantify the practical specific capacity of sorbent toward Cs. Experiments were performed by contacting different sorbents with each stock solution (No. 5–9) containing different Cs concentrations. During the experiments, 2 mL of stock solution were pipetted into a 3.5 mL glass vial containing weighed sorbent (10 mg for AMP and AMP/SiO2 ; 40 mg for AMP_PAN). Later, these vials were shaken by a shaking machine for 4  h at 1500  rpm. Afterwards, the aqueous phase in each vial was separated from the solid phase by syringe filters. Finally, 1 mL of the separated aqueous phase in each vial and 1 mL of stock solution were measured by γ-ray spectrometry to quantify the count rate of 137Cs.
6 Measurement techniques
The separated aqueous phases containing 137Cs were kept for at least half an hour to reach the 137Cs and 137mBa radioactive equilibrium before measurement. The samples containing 137Cs and 152Eu were measured with a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector (Canberra EFPC 25, Gamma
Analyst Canberra Lynx with software Genie2000) to identify and quantify the count rate of γ emitters. Gamma energies of 661 keV and 122 keV were used for 137Cs and 152Eu, respectively. Counting uncertainty (1 σ) was less than 3 % for all of the measured samples. For analyses of all active samples containing γ emitters, the same detector and the same parameters (sample geometry, position and distance) were used for the measurements of the stock solutions and the corresponding aqueous phases after phase separation. This way, no efficiency calibration was necessary.
The samples containing Ru, Zr, U and Pu (originated from stock solution No. 2 with four sorbents) and samples containing Pd and Ag (originated from stock solutions No. 3 with CLEVASOL® and AMP/SIO2) were measured on an Element II® Sector-Field Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) system produced by Thermo
Fisher Scientific. The stock-solutions were diluted 1:100and the samples were diluted between 1:3 and 1:50 with 0.28  M HNO3. The uncertainties of the ICP-MS analysis were in the range of 1.25–14 % (1 σ).The samples containing Pd and Ag (originated from stock solution No. 3 with AMP and AMP_PAN) were measured on Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
Spectrometry system (ICP-OES, VISTA AX, Agilent Technologies, Inc. USA). The samples were diluted 1:20  with 0.5 M HNO3. The uncertainty of the ICP-OES analysis is less than 2 % (1 σ).7 Uncertainty calculations
The uncertainty of different sources is shown in Table 3.
The uncertainty evaluation procedure used in this paper was to propagate each uncertainty source in experiment and the standard deviations to present the final uncertainty [33].
For example, in distribution coefficient (separation factor) experiments, the uncertainty u_Kd  for each individual experiment was calculated by applying equation (1).
@ (1)
where p1, p2, p3, … represent the parameters in the function of Kd (e. g. solute concentration, mass of sorbent, volume of solution etc.); Δp1, Δp2, Δp3 represent the absolute uncertainty of each parameter.
Table 3: The uncertainties during the experiments.
Since the experiment was performed twice, the standard deviation was calculated from the duplicated values.
@ (2)
where: Kd1 and Kd2  are the calculated values of distribution coefficient in each experiment; d K is the average value of distribution coefficient from duplicated experiments.
Finally, the uncertainty of distribution coefficient (UKd) was obtained by propagating the calculated uncertainties (u) and the standard deviation (σ) of replicates.

@ (4)
The same procedure of uncertainty evaluation was used for the study of kinetics and practical specific capacity.
In the study of Langmuir and Freundlich modeling, the final uncertainty of each parameter was calculated by propagating the uncertainty of every data point and theuncertainty from linear regression. The uncertainties presented within this work are stated as 1-σ.
8 Results and discussion
8.1 Distribution coefficients studies
The distribution coefficient (Kd) serves as an indicator for the affinity of an ion to the sorbent under specific conditions during contact. The separation factor of an ion from other interfering ions can also be obtained. In addition, the most suitable conditions for Cs-removal can be determined by considering not only high distribution coefficients of Cs but also sufficiently low distribution coefficient of U, Pu and other interfering ions (high separation factor of Cs from other ions). Distribution coefficients were calculated based on the following equation (5) [34]:
@ (5)
where Cinitial is the initial concentration of the ion (or the count rate of the radioactive ion) in solution before contacting the sorbent; Cliquid is the final concentration of theion (or the count rate of the radioactive ion) in solutionafter contact with the sorbent; V is the volume of solution (mL); m is the dry mass of the sorbent (g). ICP-MS/ICP-OES analysis directly determines the concentration of each isotope in the measured samples, while γ-ray spectrometry quantifies the count rate of each radioactive ion in the measured samples. Thus, the distribution coefficient of each metal ion can be calculated by equation (5).Plots of Kd vs. HNO3 concentration are shown in Figure  1. Kd values of all metal ions on all sorbents arelargest in 0.1  M HNO3 solution and they decrease withincreasing H+ concentration. This trend may indicate that the metal ion-exchange is inhibited due to the presence ofH+ that competes with these metal ions for the exchangesites on the sorbent [35]. The results of distribution coefficient studies on AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN (Figure1a, c and ) show that the Kd values of Cs are at least 2orders of magnitude larger than for other metal ions in 1–8 M HNO3 solutions. The Kd  value of Cs on AMP in a wide range of HNO3 agrees with the results of Suss [36]. The value of Kd(UO2) on AMP is around 20 in 0.1  M HNO3 and decreases to around 10 in 1 M HNO3, which is in agreement with previous work of Ganzerlin (~20 and ~10 in 0.1 and1 M HNO3, respectively) [37]. The high Kd value of Cs andlow Kd value of Pu on AMP_PAN in acidic solutions agreewith the values in [34]. The results of distribution coefficient studies on CLEVASOL® (Figure 1b) show that the Kdvalue of Eu is similar to that of Cs in 0.1 M HNO3 solution and the Kd value of other ions are close to the value of Csin 1–8 M HNO3 solutions. These relatively low separationf ctors of Cs on CLEVASOL® toward other metal ions in2–8 M HNO3 solutions, makes this sorbent less favorablein highly active acidic solutions.
8.2 Separation factor studies
The way to calculate the separation factor of one ion fromanother one is shown as equation (6) [32].
@ (6)
where:αA/B is the separation factor of ion A from ion B;Kd(A) is the distribution coefficient of ion A;Kd(B) is the distribution coefficient of ion B.
Figure 1: Distribution coefficients of different metal ions on AMP (a), CLEVASOL® (b), AMP/SiO2 (c) and AMP_PAN (d) in different systems.
The Kd value of Ag with CLEVASOL in 0.1–4 M HNO3 and the Kd value of Pd with CLEVASOL in 0.1 M HNO3 were given as minimum value because the concentration of Ag and Pd after adsorption was under the ICP-MS detection limit.
The separation factor of Cs from other metal ions in different systems are presented in Table 4. It is notable that the separation factors with AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN system are much higher than with CLEVASOL®. This confirms that AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN are more suitable for the Cs-removal task. In the system of AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN in higher acidic solutions (2–8  M HNO3),the separation factor of Cs from most metal ions reaches amaximum in 2 M HNO3 solution and then decreases with increasing H+ concentration, which implies the highest separation efficiency of Cs would be reached in 2 M HNO3 .
Either neutralization (with base) or dilution (with water) is possible to decrease the H+ concentration in the spent fuel solutions. However, the neutralization method will significantly increase the interfering ion concentration, which could influence the selectivity and the distribution coefficient of Cs on the sorbent (similar to H+  affecting the Kd(Cs) on the sorbent) [35]. Therefore, diluting the initially 8 M HNO3 solutions to 4 M gives the most suitable conditions in terms of fulfilling the two boundary conditions: as low as possible volume versus as high as possible separation factors.
The separation factor of Cs/Pu with AMP_PAN system is >1.36E3 in 4 M HNO3 . Todd et al. report a value of 1.4E3 in 3 M HNO3[34].

8.3 Kinetic studies of Cs adsorption
In Figure 2, the time dependence of the Cs absorption onto AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP-PAN from 4 M HNO3  solution is plotted. The ratio (C/C0) was calculated according to equation (7).
@ (7)
where: Cinitial is the count rate of 137Cs in 1 mL of solutionbefore contacting the sorbent (cps); Cliquid is the count rate of 137Cs in 1  mL of solution after contacting the sorbent(cps).
The Cs exchange process in case of AMP reaches equilibrium within 10 s, which is in agreement with a previous study [38]. The Cs exchange on AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN reaches equilibrium within 30 min. Comparing AMP and AMP/SiO2, Cs exchange on AMP_PAN is slower. The value of C/C0 increases gradually up to 300 s and then levels off from half an hour to 4 h. Cs exchange on all these sorbents can be considered as reaching equilibrium after half an hour of contact time, because no considerable change is observed of the value of C/C0 after 30  min. The kinetics curves confirm that 4  h of contacting time is morethan sufficient to reach the ion-exchange equilibrium with these sorbents in the Kd experiments. The different kinetic behavior between AMP_PAN and AMP (AMP/SiO2)is caused by the larger particle size and the much more compact internal structure of AMP_PAN compared to AMP and AMP/SiO2, which could inhibit mass transfer during the exchange process [26].
In addition, the moving boundary model was used to identify the predominant rate-controlling step during the
Cs adsorption on AMP_PAN [38–41]. The moving boundary model assumes that a sharp boundary separates a reacting shell from an unreacted core and the boundary advances toward the center of the solid during the process of adsorption [39–40].
If the adsorption process is controlled by liquid film diffusion, the following relation applies [41]:
− − Ln(1 F K ) = t (8)
If the adsorption process is controlled by ion diffusion in the solid phase, the equation used is:
2/3 1 3 − − (1 F F ) 2 + − (1 ) = Kt (9)
If the adsorption process is controlled by chemical reaction, the following equation is used:
1/3 1 ( − −1 ) F K = t (10)
where: F is the fractional attainment of equilibrium adsorption (the ratio of adsorbed Cs content on the sorbent at each time point to the adsorbed Cs content on the sorbent at equilibrium); K is the kinetic coefficient or rate constant (s−1); t is the contacting time (s) In Figure 3c, the Kt values obtained applying the three adsorption models (eqs. 8–10) in dependence of the time are shown, as well as the corresponding linear regression coefficients R2.In Figure 3a, the value of C/C0 increases only slightly from 300  s to 1800  s. By taking the results shown in
Figure  2 into consideration, it can be assumed that Cs adsorption reached equilibrium after 1800 s of contacting time in this experiment. After testing these three models for Cs adsorption on AMP_PAN, as shown in Figure 3c, the best fitting model with the highest R2 value (0.987) is the solid phase diffusion model, which indicates that the Cs exchange rate on AMP_PAN is controlled by Cs diffusion in the solid particles. This result is in agreement with the result published by Tranter et al. in 2002 [42].

8.4 Practical specific capacity studies
The practical specific capacity is expressed as the total amount of ions in gram or milligram taken up per gram of dry sorbent under specified conditions [32]. In our batch experiments, a series of tests were conducted at fixed experimental conditions (temperature, solution acidity, sorbent concentration, etc.) with different solute concentrations.
The results were evaluated by the theoretical models to describe the exchange capacity of sorbent to solute and the adsorption features in our solid-liquid systems. The Langmuir and Freundlich models are well-known models to analyze the experimental data to determine the maximum adsorption content and the adsorption features [43].
After the count rate of 137Cs was quantified in each sample and stock solution, the practical specific capacity of sorbent toward Cs was calculated by the following equation [42]:
@(11)
where: [Msolid] is the practical specific capacity (g Cs/g sorbent); Cinitial is the count rate of 137Cs in 1 mL of solution before contacting with the sorbent (cps); Cliquid is the count rate of 137Cs in 1 mL of solution after contacting with the sorbent (cps); [MCs] is the concentration of Cs in the initial solution before contacting with the sorbent (g/L); m is the mass of dry sorbent before contacting with the initial solution (g); V is the volume of the stock solution in the solidliquid system (L).
The isotherms are presented in Figure 4 by plotting the practical specific capacity of sorbent toward Cs against the equilibrium Cs concentration [Cs] eq in aqueous phase (g/L). As shown in Figure 4, the practical specific capacity increases with Cs concentration in the initial solution and gradually reaches a maximum under our specific experimental conditions. In order to analyze the experimental data, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models are used here. The classical Langmuir isotherm assumes that the sorbent has a homogeneous flat surface and a monolayer adsorption on the surface [43]. The surface contains a finite number of adsorption sites and no transmigration of adsorbate on the surface [44]. This implies that once all of the adsorption sites on the surface are filled, the maximum adsorption on the surface is achieved. The general mathematical form of the Langmuir isotherm model is presented as follows:
@(12)
where: [Msolid] is the same definition as before; K is the Langmuir equilibrium constant related to the energy of adsorption (L/g). Q is the maximum Cs adsorption on the solid phase (g Cs/g sorbent); [Cs] eq is the concentration of Cs in solution after contacting with sorbent (g/L).
The value of [Msolid] is obtained from experimental data and the values of Q and K can be determined graphically by linearization and reformulating equation (12) [44]: solid
@ (13)
When [Cs]eq is plotted against solid M the inverse of the slope is equal to Q and K is calculated from the slopeand intercept.
A linear plot of specific adsorption
against the final Cs concentration in the solution ([Cs] eq) is presented in Figure 5a and the value of parameters for Langmuir model as well as the calculated capacity from linear regression are presented in Table 5. The Langmuir model fitted the experimental data very well for Cs adsorption on three sorbents, the coefficient of determination, R2 , is larger than 0.99. The calculated capacity of AMP_PAN toward Cs (33.2 ± 6.5 mg/g) is in agreement with the value (~33  mg/g) provided by the supplier (TRISKEM). The calculated capacity of AMP toward Cs (137.8 ± 19.7  mg/g) agrees with the published data that the maximum cesium adsorption on AMP is approximately 1 mmol/g (125–145 mg/g) [18, 45]. The calculated capacity of AMP/SiO2  toward Cs is 81.2 ± 7.2 mg/g, which implies the active content of AMP in AMP/SiO2  is largerthan 50 wt.%.
One of the derived Langmuir isotherm parameters, a dimensionless constant called Langmuir separation factor (RL), can be used to distinguish “favorable” and “unfavorable” adsorption processes [45, 46]. The “favorable” adsorption indicates that the solutes have high affinity to the sorbent and vice versa. This parameter is expressed in the following equation:
@ (14)
where: K is the Langmuir constant (L/g) and [MCs] is the Cs concentration in the initial solution (g/L). If RL = 0, the adsorption is irreversible; if RL = 1, the adsorption is independent of solute concentration; if RL > 1, the adsorption is “unfavorable”; if 0 < RL < 1, the adsorption is “favorable” [46, 47]. The value of RL under different conditions is presented in Figure 5c.
Generally, the value of RL for all of our cases of Cs adsorption lies between 0 and 0.5 in Figure 5c, which indicates a “favorable” Cs adsorption process on AMP_PAN, AMP/SiO2 and AMP and confirms high affinity of Cs to these sorbents.
The other classical isotherm, the Freundlich model,was also applied to analyze the experimental data. This isotherm assumes that the sorbent has a heterogeneous flat surface and the mathematical form is as follows [43].
@(15)
@ (16)where: [Msolid] and [Cs] eq have the same definitions as with the Langmuir isotherm; A and n are dimensionless constants that relate to the adsorption capacity and adsorption strength, respectively [48].
Similarly the values of A and n can also be determinedby plotting log([Msolid]) against log([Cs]eq), the slope isequal to (1/n) and the intercept is equal to log(A).The adsorption process is usually classified by the values of n: good (2–10), moderately difficult (1–2), poor (<1) [46, 49], and the Freundlich model is not effective (>10). This method is denoted as “n” method by
Chengjun [49].
A linear plot of log([Msolid]) versus log([Cs] eq) is presented in Figure 5b. The values of Freundlich parameters are calculated and presented in Table 5. The Freundlich
model fitted also very well for Cs adsorption on these three sorbents with R2 > 0.97. According to the “n” method, the Freundlich constant n for all three sorbents is in the range of 2–10, which shows good adsorption to Cs in these systems. In addition, the Freundlich constant n and A are of the order of AMP > AMP/SiO2 > AMP_PAN, which indicates that the Cs adsorption intensity and adsorption capacity to Cs are both of the order of AMP > AMP/ SiO2 > AMP_PAN. This confirms the results of Langmuir model simulation that the adsorption capacity toward Cs is of the order of AMP > AMP/SiO2 > AMP_PAN.

9 Conclusion and outlook
In the present paper, two promising sorbents CLEVASOL® and AMP and two engineered products AMP_PAN and AMP/SiO2 are examined in order to develop a suitable and efficient system for a selective Cs-removal process from high-acidic spent nuclear fuel solutions. The results of batch experiments confirmed that the AMP system (AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN) is the better option for selectiveremoval of Cs, and that the suitable acid concentration is 4 M HNO3 due to the sufficiently high separation factor of Cs from other metal ions and small dilution factor for the spent fuel solutions. The kinetic study results suggest that 300 s of contacting time in the batch method is sufficient to remove the bulk of Cs from the solutions by AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN, even though the equilibrium is notfully reached. The Cs adsorption process on AMP_PAN ismuch slower than the Cs adsorption process on AMP andAMP/SiO2 because the Cs adsorption on AMP_PAN is asolid phase diffusion controlled process. The maximum Csadsorption, calculated from Langmuir linear regression,on AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN are 137.8 ± 19.7  mg/g,81.2 ± 7.2  mg/g and 3.2 ± 6.5  mg/g, respectively in 4  MHNO3. In summary, batch method tests proved that AMP, AMP/SiO2 and AMP_PAN are very promising materials for selectively Cs-removal. The purchased AMP_PAN and labmade AMP/SiO2 will be further investigated in terms of column operations.
