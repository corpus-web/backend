Abstract
Holdup and axial dispersion of liquid phase in a catalytic exchange column were investigated by measuring residence time distributions (RTD) using a radiotracer technique. RTD experiments were independently carried out with two different types of packings i.e. hydrophobic water-repellent supported platinum catalyst and a mixture (50% (v/v)) of hydrophobic catalyst and a hydrophillic wettable packing were used in the column. Mean residence times and hold-ups of the liquid phase were estimated at different operating conditions. Axial dispersion model (ADM) and axial dispersion with exchange model (ADEM) were used to simulate the measured RTD data. Both the models were found equally suitable to describe the measured data. The degree of axial mixing was estimated in terms of Peclet number (Pe) and Bodenstein number (Bo). Based on the obtained parameters of the ADM, correlations for total liquid hold-up (HT) and axial mixing in terms of Bo were proposed for design and scale up of the full-scale catalytic exchange column.

1. Introduction
The role of heavy water as a moderator and coolant in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWR) in the nuclear power industry is well recognized. Heavy water evokes excitement among nuclear scientists and captures the imagination of the nuclear reactor designer owing to its ability to yield enhanced neutron economy to sustain the chain reaction and thereby facilitates the use of natural uranium as fuel. The widespread use of heavy water in the nuclear industry led to the development of a number of production strategies following both physical and chemical approaches. Among the various options available for the production of heavy water, the exchange of deuterium between hydrogen and liquid water has many attractive features such as high separation factor, mild operating conditions associated with handling of non-toxic and non-corrosive materials (Butler, 1980, Dave et al., 1997, Miller, 2001). While the outlook of this process is quite promising, the slow exchange reaction between the liquid water and gaseous hydrogen emerged as the major impediment that limits its utility. In order to circumvent this drawback, use of a suitable catalyst to promote rapid exchange is a viable alternative.
Over the years, a number of catalysts based on platinum have been tried among which platinum impregnated activated carbon emerged as the most effective catalyst. While the use of platinum impregnated activated carbon is a successful alternative to accelerate the reaction kinetics, the active sites of the catalyst lose their catalytic activity rapidly when it comes in contact with liquid during the water-hydrogen isotope exchange reaction (Maloney et al., 1955). In order to mitigate the above mentioned inherent drawback, use of hydrophobic catalyst impregnated platinum or conventional catalyst covered with a permeable hydrophobic film is deemed worthy of consideration (Stevens, 1972). Such a strategy seemed attractive as it provides access to reactants to reach active sites inside the catalyst pores and at the same time protects the catalyst from wetting. The industrial process for the catalytic isotope exchange reaction is carried out in a trickle bed type column where water flow downwards counter-currently to hydrogen through a fixed bed of catalyst to transfer deuterium from water to hydrogen. Use of a catalytic exchange column facilitates the hydrogen-water vapor exchange reaction and gas-liquid mass transfer simultaneously in a single unit which otherwise would have been carried out separately in different sections using conventional wettable catalysts (Butler et al., 1978). Other advantages of using a trickle bed type of exchange column include simplicity in design, compact size, near ambient operation, high catalyst loading per unit volume of liquid, flexibility with respect to production rates and operating conditions, and high system integrity. Although the water repellent nature of the catalyst is prolific to mitigate the consequence of internal wetting, it deteriorates liquid phase flow distribution and effective gas-liquid contact area limiting the gas-liquid mass transfer. This limitation can be circumvented by diluting the catalyst bed with a wettable inert ceramic mass transfer packing (Rolston and Goodale, 1972).
While the use of a mixture of packing i.e. combination of catalyst and wettable inert ceramic mass transfer packing is considered as a major step in bolstering the reaction kinetics, the design, modeling and overall performance of multiphase catalytic reactors depend not only on the relevant intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, but also on the associated hydrodynamics of the flowing phases (Dudukovic et al., 1999, Dudukovic et al., 2002). The hydrodynamics of the catalytic exchange column is mainly characterized by the liquid holdup and axial dispersion. Liquid holdup is an important parameter of the column, and is directly related to column pressure drop, effective interfacial area, average liquid film thickness and inter-phase heat and mass transfer effects. On the other hand, axial mixing in the column is undesired as it tends to reduce overall mass transfer (Macias-Salinas and Fair, 2000). It has been reported that the extent of axial dispersion of the gas phase for the counter-current packed bed contactors operating below the loading point is insignificant as compared to the liquid phase and can be approximated as plug flow (Dunn et al., 1977, Macias-Salinas and Fair, 2000, Froment and Bischoff, 1979). The hydrodynamic parameters of liquid phase in packed columns are usually determined by measurement and analysis of residence time distribution (RTD) (Danckwerts, 1953, Nauman and Buffham, 1983, Wen and Fan, 1975). The studies have mainly been carried out for co-current down flow contactors with reaction in liquid phase and wettable catalyst packing (Gianetto and Specchia, 1992, Herskowitz and Smith, 1983, Ng and Chu, 1987). However, very few studies on a counter-current packed bed column filled with hydrophobic packing or a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic packing have been reported (Kumar et al., 2013, Kumar et al., 2012). Stimulus-response technique using radiotracers is widely used to measure RTD of the flowing phases in industrial process systems (International Atomic Energy Agency, TECDOC-1262, 2001., Pant et al., 2001a, Pant et al., 2001b). The present paper describes measurements of holdup and axial dispersion of liquid phase in a pilot-scale catalytic exchange column at different operating conditions with two different types of indigenously developed packings.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalytic exchange column
The schematic diagram of the catalytic exchange column and experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The column consists of a stainless steel column of 40 mm inner diameter and 2000 mm length, a humidifier and gas and liquid supply systems. Demineralized (DM) water and hydrogen were used as liquid and gas phases, respectively. The water from a storage tank was pumped into the top of the column with the help of a metering pump. Hydrogen gas was fed at the bottom of the humidifier that fully saturates the gas with water vapor at the reactor temperature. A water repellent catalyst was prepared by mixing platinum loaded carbon with poly tetra fluoro ethylene (PTFE) powder that acts as binder as well as hydrophobic agent and then compacting it in the form of Raschig rings of size: 6 mm (height) x 6 mm (outer diameter) x 3 mm (inner diameter), and with overall composition of platinum: carbon: PTFE as 0.001: 0.009: 0.99 (wt/wt). The shape of the Raschig ring was selected as it offers less pressure drop in the column, provides high specific external surface area and is easy to fabricate. The water repellent nature of the catalyst was examined by measuring the contact angles for ultra pure water on the catalyst samples. The contact angles of the catalyst were measured using a GBX instrument and found to be in the range of 112°±1.04% that is close to the contact angle for the pure PTFE material, i.e. 110°. Ceramic Raschig rings of the same dimension as that of the catalyst were used as inert hydrophilic material for mixing with catalyst and to be used as packing.

2.2. Radiotracer experiments
The schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. A series of radiotracer experiments was carried out to measure the residence time distribution of the liquid phase at different combinations of gas and liquid flow rates as shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. The range of liquid and gas flow rates used was 0.83×10−7 - 16.67 ×10−7 m3/s and 0 - 3.33×10−4 m3/s, respectively. The experiments were carried out at ambient conditions, and at a temperature of 60oC and pressure of 0.5 bar (g). The RTD measurements were independently carried out with two different types of packings i.e. pure catalyst and a mixture of catalyst and ceramic Raschig rings (50% (v/v)). Before conducting the actual experiments, the packing was completely saturated (wetted) with water by pumping it at a higher flow rate for half an hour. Bromine-82 (half-life: 36 h, gamma energies: 0.55–1.48 MeV) as ammonium bromide aqueous solution was used as a tracer and about 10 MBq activity was used in each run. The tracer was instantaneously injected into the water feed line at the top of the column. The steady state flow condition was ensured before injecting the tracer in each run. The tracer concentration was monitored at the inlet (D1) and outlet (D2) of the column using two independent collimated NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors (crystal size: 25 mm x 25 mm). The detectors were connected to a computer controlled multichannel data acquisition system, set to record data at an interval of one second. The detectors D1 and D2 were separated by a distance of 1300 mm.

3. Data analysis and results
The tracer concentration data recorded by the detectors for each run were treated for background, tail correction and zero shift, normalized and converted to RTD curves using a residence time distribution analysis software (IAEA, 1996). First moments (Mi) of the input and output tracer concentration curves were determined using the following relation (IAEA, 1996):
@(1)
where i=1 for the input curve and i=2 for output curve. The difference of first moments of the two curves gives the experimental mean residence time (MRT),  of the process fluid in the system as:
@(2)
where,  and  are the first moments of input and the output tracer concentration curves, respectively. Based on the MRT, the total liquid holdup can be calculated using the following relation:
@(3)
where, HT: total liquid holdup and is the fraction of the void volume occupied by liquid, : experimentally determined MRT, QL: volumetric liquid flow rate, and VR: effective bed volume between the detectors. The effective volume of the bed is determined by multiplying the volume of the test section by the bed voidage. The effective volume of the test section was determined to be 7.83×10−4 m3. The values of MRT and liquid holdup for different column operating conditions for both types of packings are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

In order to investigate and describe axial mixing of the liquid phase in packed bed columns or trickle bed reactors (TBRs), a simple axial dispersion model (ADM) has been successfully used (Levenspiel, 1972, Wen and Fan, 1975, Shah, 1979; Furzer and Michell, 1970; Cassanello et al., 1992; Tsamatsoulis and Papayannakos, 1994; Fu and Tan, 1996; Saroha et al., 1998, Otake and Kunugita, 1958; Sater and Levenspiel, 1966; Choe and Lee, 1985). The predicted model parameters follow a definite trend with the varying operating conditions thus enabling to develop the necessary correlations. However, it fails to describe the tailing effect i.e. long tail present in RTD curves, which is a typical characteristic of TBRs or packed bed columns filled with porous or non-porous packings. The tailing effect mainly results due to (i) exchange between dynamic and stagnant fluid in column particularly operating at very liquid flow rates and (ii) mass exchange between the dynamic liquid flow and the static liquid present in porous catalyst particles. For better representation of such situations, Villermaux and van Swaaij (1969) proposed a more representative model that incorporates both the phenomenon i.e. longitudinal dispersion as well as the mass transfer between the dynamic and stagnant phases and is commonly known as axial-dispersion exchange model (ADEM). Both the models were applied to simulate the data in the present investigation and are briefly described below.
3.2. Axial dispersion model (ADM)
If the tracer is instantaneously injected into the system, then the tracer balance equation of the dispersion model for negligible dispersion in radial direction in dimensionless from is given as:
@(4)
where: C: dimensionless tracer concentration (C(t)/C(0), θ: dimensionless time (t/τ), t: time variable, τ: model predicted mean residence time, Pe: Peclet number (UL/D), X: dimensionless axial co-ordinate (x/L), U: mean linear velocity, D: axial dispersion coefficient, C(t): tracer concentration at time t, and C(0): initial tracer concentration. For the measurement of tracer at two axial locations along the system with open-open boundary conditions, the normalized solution of the above tracer balance equation is given as (Levenspiel, 1972):
@(5)
where, E(θ) is the exit age distribution function. The model has two parameters i.e. Pe and τ. The adjustable parameter Pe represents the ratio of the convective to dispersive effects. In other words, dispersion is predominant when the value of Pe is low and insignificant when it is large. This implies that the plug flow and well-mixed flow conditions prevail within the system when Pe→∞ and Pe→0, respectively. For flow through packed bed, the axial dispersion is also expressed in term of another dimensionless number called Bodenstein number (Bo) and is expressed as Pe.dp/L, where dp is diameter or characteristic length of the packing element.
3.3. Axial dispersion with exchange model (ADEM)
The mass balance equations of the model for an impulse injection are given in terms of the following differential equations:
@(6)
@(7)
with the following initial and boundary conditions for an impulse injection of tracer:
@(8)
@(9)
where, Cd, Cs: concentration of radiotracer in dynamic and stagnant phases, respectively, N: number of transfer units (), K: exchange rate of radiotracer (s−1), L: height of the measuring section, Ud: mean velocity of the dynamic phase, Ped: Peclet number in dynamic phase (UdL/Dd), Dd: axial dispersion coefficient in dynamic phase (m2/s), θ: dimensionless time (tUd/L), X=x/L, t: time variable, τ: mean residence time, x: distance from top of the column, and :volume of dynamic phase (Vd) / volume of dynamic phase (Vd) + volume of stagnant phase (Vs). The model has four parameters i.e. τ, Ped, φ, and N, and reduces to the axial dispersion model for N=0 and axial dispersion with exchange model for Ped approaching to infinity.
The analytical solution of the model Eqs.(6), (7) for initial and boundary conditions given in Eqs.was proposed by Villermaux and van Swaaij (1969). Because of the complex nature of the analytical solution, it was not possible to use the same for simulations and fitting to the experimental data. Therefore, the above equations were numerically solved in Laplace domain and the following solution was obtained (van Swaaij et al., 1969).
@(10)
where,
@(11)
@(12)
By inverting the solution obtained in Laplace domain (Eq. (10)), the solution of the ADEM model was obtained in time domain and used to fit to the experimentally obtained RTD data.
For a non-ideal concentration curve pulse X(t) measured at location i.e. x=0, the model predicted curve at the downstream location i.e. x=L is obtained by convoluting the model solution with the pulse X(t). Thus:
@(13)
The model predicted curve Ym(t) is fitted with the measured normalized tracer concentration using the least square curve fitting method and model parameters corresponding to best fit are obtained (Michelsen, 1972). A RTD analysis software "Afour" based on the above methodology was used for simulations (Pant, 2001). Table 1, Table 2 gives the details of operating conditions, and piston-dispersion model parameters for hydrophobic catalyst and a mixture of hydrophobic catalyst and hydrophilic packings (50% v/v), respectively. Similarly, Table 3, Table 4 give the ADEM parameters for the same experimental runs for both the catalyst beds, respectively.
4. Discussion
The effect of operating variables such as gas and liquid velocities, column temperature and packing composition on total liquid holdup and axial dispersion were investigated. The details are discussed below.
4.1. Mean residence time and liquid holdup
The MRTs were determined from the measured tracer concentration curves and subsequently the total liquid holdup was determined for two different type of packing materials i.e. a hydrophobic and mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic packings and are shown in Table 1, Table 2. The variation of experimentally measured MRTs of liquid phase with varying liquid flow rates for the two types of packing materials are shown in Fig. 2a and b. It is observed that for both the packing materials, the MRT of liquid phase in the column is found to be decreasing with increasing liquid flow rates. However, no significant effect of gas flow rate and temperature was observed for the range of operating parameters investigated.

The variation of total liquid holdup obtained from measured MRT is shown in Fig. 3a and b for hydrophobic and mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic packings, respectively. It can be observed that the total liquid holdup increases as the liquid flow rate increases for both the packings. The values of total liquid holdup for the hydrophobic catalyst packing ranged from 0.015 to 0.048, whereas for the mixture of packings, it ranged from 0.057 to 0.151. The liquid holdup is higher with the mixture of packings. This increase in liquid holdup is due to the wettable nature of hydrophlic packing used in the mixture. With the varying gas flow rates and temperature, no significant effect on MRT and the liquid holdup was observed.

The fluid flow rates and physical properties of the packings such as shape, size, porosity and wetability are the major factors that affect the liquid holdup in packed beds or TBRs (Kushalkar and Pangarkar, 1990). In the present study, it was observed that a counter-current gas-liquid system with a sepecific packing and operating with lower ranges of liquid and gas flow rates, the variation in liquid holdup was mainly due to change in the liquid flow rates only. Therefore, the total liquid holdup data were correlated in terms of liquid flow rates using regression analysis and the following correlations were obtained.

where, U is the superficial liquid velocity in m/s. From the obtained correlations, the values of HT were estimated and compared with the values obtained from the experiments. Fairly good agreement was observed between the correlation predicted (Eqs. (14), (15)) and experimentally determined values of HT with a maximum difference of ±20% for most of the data as shown in Fig. 4a and b.

4.2. Axial mixing
In order to investigate the effect of liquid and gas velocities on axial mixing, the measured RTD data were simulated using two different models i.e. ADM and ADEM and the model parameters corresponding to best fits were obtained. The axial dispersion in the column was quantified in terms of Pe and results obtained using ADM are given in Table 1, Table 2 for both types of packings. It is observed that at higher liquid flow rates, the model fits very well to the experimentally measured data as can be seen from Fig. 5a and b. However, at lower liquid flow rates, the model could not fit adequately to the tail part of the measured tracer response curves (Fig. 6a and b) and this has resulted in significant difference between experimental and ADM predicted MRTs. This was particularly observed in run numbers 1, 2 and 14 (Table 1). The values of Pe with the hydrophobic catalyst packing ranged from 4 to 43, whereas with the mixed packing, the values ranged from 7 to 25. The molecular diffusivity of the liquid within the packing is much smaller (1.5–3×10−9 m2/s) than the estimated axial dispersion coefficients (1–3×10−7 m2/s) indicating significant presence of axial mixing of liquid phase in the column for the range of operating parameter used in the study. The effect of gas and liquid flow rates and operating temperature on Pe is shown in (Fig. 7a and b) for hydrophobic and mixed packing, respectively. It is observed that at a constant gas flow rate, the Pe increases as the liquid flow rate increases with both the packings. However, no conclusive effect of gas flow rates was observed. This substantiates the findings of previous investigators that the liquid phase is not affected by the gas flow rate at operating conditions below the loading point (e.g. Otake and Kunugita (1958), Sater and Levenspiel (1966), Bennett and Goodridge (1970)). The small variation of column temperature also does not have significant effect on the liquid phase axial mixing. Based on the estimated values of Pe, the Bodenstein number (Bo= Pe.dp/L) were also estimated. Fig. 10a and b show variation in Bo with varying operating parameters. It shows that values of Bo increase as the liquid flow rate increases for both the packings. However, the dependence of the Bo on gas flow rates and temperature was not distinguishable for the range of operating parameter used. These results are in good agreement with the studies reported earlier for trickle bed contactors operating below the loading point (Furzer and Michell, 1970; Co and Bibaud, 1971; Cassanello et al., 1992).

The ADEM has four adjustable parameters which are evaluated simultaneously from the measured response curves. Representative plots illustrating the effects of gas and liquid flow rates, and operating temperature on parameters (τ, Ped, N, φ) of ADEM for the hydrophobic packing have been shown in Figs. 8a, b, 9a and b. The values of Ped with the hydrophobic catalyst packing ranged from 13 to 82, whereas with the mixed packing, the values ranged from 17 to 60. However, the values of Ped observed are higher than that evaluated with ADM. This may be due to the fact that in ADEM a fraction of non-ideality in fluid flow pattern is captured by the N. In general, the mass transfer parameter (N) and fraction of dynamic liquid hold-up (φ) increases with the increase of liquid flow rates. Similar trends were observed at a few operating conditions for both the packings, however, in general, a large scattering in the optimized model parameter values, particularly with, Ped, NTU and φ can be observed. This may be due to several factors such as the tail part of the curve cannot be measured accurately due to low tracer concentrations. In addition to this, the minor variations in treatment of data may also lead to significant variation in prediction of model parameters (Stegeman et al., 1996).

For a model with four parameters, the set of model parameter values may not be very unique that can only provide a good data fit, as compared to models having fewer parameters. Therefore, a small deviation or error in measurement of response curve leads to significant variation or scatter in the estimated values of these parameters leading to inconclusive trends. In addition to this, the ADEM is comparatively more computationally intensive. Considering the inaccuracy involve in measurement of tracer concentration in the tail part of the response curve and nonporous and partially non-wettable nature of the packing, the minor deviation in fitting of the tail part of the response curves can be ignored as they will not have significant impact in design and scale up of the exchange column. Therefore, ADM model was used to develop the empirical correlations for quantification of axial mixing.
For packed bed counter-current systems, most of the correlations reported in the literature for axial dispersion are in terms of Bodenstein numbers (Bo) which in turn is correlated with the Reynolds number (Re) and Galileo number (Ga) as Bo=f(Re, Ga). Fuzer and Michell (1970) studied the dispersion effect for a similar column of 50 mm diameter filled with ceramic rasching rings of 6 mm diameter and developed the following correlation for the axial dispersion in the bed.

All the parameters mentioned in Eq. (16) are constant and system specific except that of liquid phase superficial velocity UL and therefore the above correlation can be modified for the system investigated in the present study. Thus:

where, constant A, A1 and B1 are specific to the system and were obtained by regression analysis. The values of the constant obtained from regression analysis are shown in Table 5. After obtaining the values of the constant, the values of Bo were obtained using correlation given in Eq. (17). Good agreement was observed between the values of Bo obtained from the developed correlation and experimentally determined values within±25% of difference for most of the data (Fig. 10).

Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the liquid phase Bodenstein numbers (Bo) computed using the correlations developed in this study and correlations developed by other investigators with the Raschig ring packings (Sater and Levenspiel, 1966; Fuzer and Michell, 1970; Co and Bibaud, 1971). The range of liquid flow rates investigated in the present work (0.5<Re<10) is on the lower side as compared to the other studies. Therefore, it is evident that there is a significant disagreement among all the correlations reported, which may be due to the difference in operating conditions and sizes and wettability of packings used.

5. Conclusions
The investigation of holdup and axial dispersion of liquid phase in a catalytic exchange column was successfully carried out by measuring RTD of the liquid phase using radiotracer techniques with two different types of catalyst packings i.e. hydrophobic (non-wettable) catalyst and a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic (wettable) packings. The total liquid holdup in the column was obtained from the MRTs determined from the measured tracer response curves. It was found that the liquid holdup increased with increasing liquid flow rate and was independent of gas flow rate for the range of operating parameters investigated. The comparison of liquid holdup for hydrophobic and mixed packing indicated that liquid holdups were higher with the mixed packing. Two different models i.e. ADM and ADEM were used to simulate the measured tracer concentration curves. At higher liquid flow rates, both the models were able to describe the liquid flow in the packed column, whereas at the lower flow rates where tailing effect was more predominant, the ADEM model was found more suitable to describe the liquid flow in the column. However, the tailing effect is ignored considering the inaccuracy involve in measurement of tracer concentration in the tail part of the response curve and nonporous characteristics of wettable packing, the ADM model was used for developing suitable correlations for the axial mixing. The axial mixing of the liquid phase in the column was quantified in terms of Bodenstein number (Bo). Significant axial dispersion of liquid phase was observed within the column for both the packings. The axial dispersion was marginally higher with the mixed packing. It was observed that the axial dispersion decreased with increase in liquid flow rate and was independent of gas flow rate for the range of operating parameters used. Based on the results, suitable empirical correlations were developed for prediction holdup and axial dispersion of liquid phase in the column. The results of the study will be utilized for design and modeling of an industrial-scale chemical exchange column for separation of hydrogen isotopes.
