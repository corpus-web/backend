Abstract
A new strategy for identifying the water-insoluble radiolytic products of bis(2-propoloxy)calix[4]crown-6/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2]) system was established by using a hydrophilic ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([C4mim][OTf]) instead of the hydrophobic [C4mim][NTf2]. The main water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] were easily obtained as precipitate by water-washing after irradiation, and the changes in the chemical structure of BPC6 after irradiation and their influence on Cs extraction were studied. It was found that during γ-ray irradiation, the radicals generated from the ionic liquid prefer to form substitution products with BPC6, such as trifluoromethyl and imidazolium substituted BPC6. ESI-MS study indicated that substitution of BPC6 by trifluoromethyl would lead to further substitution. Moreover, DFT calculations demonstrated the optimal substitution sites as the para-position to isopropyl on the BPC6 benzene ring. Cs extraction experiments showed a satisfactory extraction performance that even after 500 kGy irradiation under 1 M HNO3 condition, the Cs distribution ratio was as high as 7.91. The extraction performance does not decrease drastically during irradiation, as the relatively abundant trifluoromethyl substituted BPC6 remains partial extractability.

1. Introduction
137Cs, a radionuclide of cesium which has a long half life (t1/2 = 30.2 year) and high energy gamma rays (662 keV), is a major radioactive fission product and one of the major target nuclides for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. With the wide application of nuclear energy, more and more attention has been paid towards the safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel containing 137Cs, which is a huge threat to human health and the environment. The purpose of 137Cs removing is to recycle the useful nuclides and reduce radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel. As macrocyclic receptors, calix[4]arene crown ethers (CCEs) exhibit high selectivity and a strong coordination ability to alkali metals based on the cation-π interactions (Prodi et al., 2000; Ugozzoli et al., 1995), which have been utilized for Cs extraction (Kim et al., 2010, 2012; Makrlik and Vanura, 2018). Song C. et al. proved that CCEs exhibits good extraction performance and high selectivity for Cs ions (Gao et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2004a, 2004b). In recent years, CCEs in combination with ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted widespread attention in the area of 137Cs removal (Luo et al., 2004; Sieffert and Wipff, 2006; Xu et al., 2010), because of the unparalleled advantages of ILs compared to traditional organic solvents in the separation of radionuclide (Kishor et al., 2018; Leoncini et al., 2017; Mohapatra, 2017; Rao et al., 2011), for instance, negligible vapor pressure, excellent solubility, high thermal and chemical stability (Chowdhury et al., 2007; Welton, 1999), etc.
During the treatment of spent nuclear fuel, the extraction system will be exposed to a strong radiation environment formed by the radionuclides, so the research on the radiation stability of the extraction system is of great significance in the liquid-liquid extraction process. Lots of studies have been conducted on the radiation effect of ILs and their extraction systems (Wang et al., 2014; Ao et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2002; Yuan et al., 2009a, 2009b; Yuan et al., 2009c; Yuan et al., 2009d. In our previous work, the trace water-soluble γ-radiolytic products of imidazole-based ILs were qualitatively and quantitatively identified via deuterium oxide separation (Ao et al., 2013a, 2014, 2015a). Meanwhile, a substantial efforts have been made on the radiation stability of solid CCEs based on the radiolysis behavior of two model chemicals (1-isopropoxybenzene and benzo-18-crown-6 ether), and the radiolysis mechanism of bis(2-propoloxy)calix[4]crown-6 (BPC6) was analyzed (Ao et al., 2013b, 2013c). In addition, the radiolytic stability of CCEs dissolved in phenyl trifluoromethyl sulphone was investigated (Jagasia et al., 2014). Although the radiolytic products of crown ethers/ILs system had been proposed as substituted crown ethers formed between crown ether and active radicals only by using high-resolution ESI-MS (Ao et al., 2015b), the main radiolytic products, which are insoluble in water, have not been gained until now. This is mainly due to the difficult separation of water-insoluble radiolytic products from the system after irradiation.
In this work, we select a hydrophilic IL ([C4mim][OTf]) as the diluent, which has a chemical structure similar to [C4mim][NTf2], and the radiolytic behavior of BPC6 in [C4mim][OTf] was studied. The water-insoluble radiolytic products were precipitated from the system by a water-washing step after irradiation and the radiation effect of BPC6 in IL was clearly studied. It was expected to provide a new strategy to study the γ-radiation effect of BPC6/ILs and accessing their influence on the Cs extraction.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The BPC6 solid (with a purity >96%) was obtained from Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, and the synthesis and purification of BPC6 have been reported previously (Asfari et al., 1999; Casnati et al., 1995). [C4mim][NTf2] and [C4mim][OTf] (>99%) were obtained from Lanzhou Greenchem ILs, LICP, CAS, China (Lanzhou, China). The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. All other solvents were analytical-grade reagent and used without further purification.

2.2. Irradiation
0.015 mol L−1 BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] and BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] solutions were irradiated (298 ± 4 K) using a 60Co source with an average dose rate of ca. 400 Gy min−1 (Institute of Applied Chemistry of Peking University). The dose rate was traced by Fricke dosimeter which was placed at sample position.
2.3. Characterization
BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] solution after 500 kGy irradiation was taken in a clean plastic centrifuge tube, followed by adding five volumes of deionized water. After Oscillatory mixing by using IKA VORTX GENIUS 3 vortex mixer for 2 min, the mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min (5000 rpm) to ensure that the precipitated extracting agent was separated from the solution. The precipitate was washed by deionized water for 5 times, and dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C) for 24 h. The precipitate as the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] was used for the subsequent characterization and extraction experiments. For comparison, the original BPC6 underwent the same process except irradiation. The process of obtaining the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] after irradiation is shown in Fig. 2.

XPS analysis: The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with an AXIS-Ultra instrument from Kratos Analytical. The binding energies were calibrated using C1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.80 eV.
Micro-FTIR: The original BPC6 and water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific Micro Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Magna-IR 750). Resolution: 0.125 cm−1; Scanning range: 4000–600 cm−1.
1H and 19F NMR: NMR experiments were carried out with a Bruker AV-500. The original BPC6 and water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] were diluted in trichloromethane-d (CDCl3). For 1H and 19F NMR spectra, the chemical shift scale was calibrated with tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm and C6F6 at −162.73 ppm (Berthon et al., 2006), respectively.
High-resolution ESI-MS: The original BPC6, water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] and the BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] solution before and after irradiation were diluted in pure DMSO. The mass spectrometry measurements were recorded on a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Apex IV, Bruker, Switzerland). High purity nitrogen was used as the nebulizing and drying gases. m/z(E) and m/z(T) represent experimental exact m/z and theoretical exact m/z, respectively.
2.4. Extraction experiments
The original BPC6 and water-insoluble products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] were dissolved in unirradiated [C4mim][NTf2] to prepare a 0.015 mol L−1 IL solution, of which 0.5 mL was taken for the extraction experiment. The aqueous solution (0.5 mL) containing 0.01 mol L−1 Cs+ was prepared by dissolving CsNO3 in deionized water or 1 mol L−1 nitric acid. The experiments were carried out in an Oscillator incubator (HZQ-F100, Pei Ying Experimental Equipment Co., Ltd., Suzhou) with a rotating speed of 180 rpm at 298 ± 1 K. After extraction, the mixtures were centrifuged in a Centrifuge (THL-16B, Anting Electronic Instrument, Shanghai) for 5 min (5000 rpm) to ensure that the two phases were completely separated. The Cs+ concentration in each solution diluted with deionized water was measured by a Prodigy high dispersion inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (Teledyne Leeman Labs, USA). The calculation of the distribution ratio (DCs) and extraction efficiency (ECs) was based on  and , in which  and  indicate the initial and final Cs+ concentrations, respectively.
2.5. Theoretical calculations
Calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 program package using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level of theory (Lee et al., 1988; M. J. Frisch et al., 2009). The 6-31G(d) basis set was used for all C, H, N, O and F atoms, and the LANL2DZ basis set was used for cesium ions (Chaichana et al., 2019; Contreras et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Veloso et al., 2015). Geometry optimizations and electronic calculations for all of the species were carried out in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level of theory. All chemical structures were confirmed without imaginary frequencies by calculating the frequencies. The enthalpies (Hg), entropies (Sg) and Gibbs free energies (Gg) were calculated with zero-point energy (ZPE) and thermal corrections with the M062X/6-311++G(d,p)/LANL2DZ method in the gas phase (298.15 K). Based on the optimized structures, the solvation Gibbs free energies (Gsol) in [C4mim][NTf2] were obtained by the universal continuum solvation model of SMD (Marenich et al., 2009) at the M062X/6-311G++(d,p)/LANL2DZ level of theory.
3. Results and discussions
In our previous work on the radiation effect of BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] system for the extraction of Cs (Xu et al., 2010), the radiolysis of BPC6 could not be studied in detail, because it is pretty difficult to separate the water-insoluble radiolytic products from the BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] system after irradiation. To solve this problem, BPC6 was dissolved in [C4mim][OTf], a hydrophilic IL with a chemical structure similar to hydrophobic [C4mim][NTf2]. Since [C4mim][OTf] is a water-soluble diluent, it could be removed using a water-washing step after irradiation. The water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6 in the IL could then be precipitated as a solid and dried for subsequent analysis. In order to ascertain the structure of substituted radiolytic products of BPC6 in the IL, the precipitate was first subjected to XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, for the original BPC6, only the signals for C1s and O1s were detected at 284.8 eV and 532.8 eV, respectively. Apart from the carbon and oxygen elements, the signals for S2p, N1s and F1s were also detected for the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf]. The N1s signal was fitted and results showed that two forms of nitrogen exist in water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] (401.7 eV and 400.2 eV), corresponding to the nitrogen atoms of [C4mim]+ and [OTf]-, respectively. In addition, the S2p signal could be attributed to the sulfur atoms in Sdouble bondO (168.3 eV) and S–O (169.5 eV). These results indicate that the radiolytic products of IL reacted with BPC6 during irradiation.

In order to study the variation of the BPC6 functional groups during irradiation, The original BPC6 and the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] were analyzed using Micro-FTIR spectroscopy and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption of the original BPC6 is the same as reported in the literature (Ao et al., 2013c). For the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf], absorption bands appear at 3100-3200 cm−1 and 1655 cm−1, corresponding to stretching vibrations of H–Cdouble bondC and Cdouble bondC on the imidazole rings, respectively. Besides, the vibration absorption bands of Sdouble bondO and C–F in [OTf]- were discovered at 1248 cm−1 and 1030 cm−1, respectively (Ao et al., 2013a). The above results indicate that the imidazole structure of [C4mim][OTf] reacts with BPC6 during irradiation, which is consistent with the XPS results.

The 1H and 19F NMR spectra of the original BPC6 and the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] are shown in Fig. 5. For the original BPC6, the assignment of each signal peak in the 1H NMR spectrum was as follows: δ(ppm) = 0.91 (d, 6H, CH(CH3)2), 3.33 (m, 4H, CH2), 3.46 (m, 4H, CH2), 3.53 (m, 4H, CH2), 3.67 (m, 4H, CH2), 3.72 (s, 4H, CH2), 3.78 (s, 8H, ArCH2Ar), 4.23 (m, 2H, CH(CH3)2), 6.81 (m, 4H, Ar para) and 7.01–7.07 (dd, 8H, Ar meta), which is consistent with that reported in the literature (Casnati et al., 1995). For the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf], the 1H NMR signals corresponding to the imidazole structure appeared at δ = 9.31 and 8.14 ppm. In addition, the 19F NMR signal of [OTf]- shifted towards the lower field from δ = −79.55 ppm to δ = −79.37 ppm, indicating that the electron cloud density of the imidazole structure has changed, thereby affecting the electron cloud density of [OTf]-. By combining the above-mentioned results, it was confirmed that the imidazole structure of [C4mim][OTf] has reacted with the BPC6 during irradiation. Behar et al. (2001) did the pulse radiolysis researches on [C4mim][PF6] and [C4mim][BF4] and studied the reaction kinetics of [CCl3O2]radical dot in ILs systems. Their experimental results showed that irradiation of the ILs produced [C4mim]radical dot and [C4mim]2+radical dot radicals. Shkrob et al. (2007) studied the initial process of IL radiolysis and also found that [C4mim]radical dot and [C4mim]2+radical dot radicals were generated during the radiolysis of imidazolium cations. Herein during irradiation, radicals such as [C4mim]radical dot and [C4mim]2+radical dot generated from [C4mim][OTf] will further attack the extracting agent to form imidazolium substituted BPC6.

To identify the structure of the water-insoluble radiolytic products and testify the feasibility of using a hydrophilic [C4mim][OTf] instead of a hydrophobic [C4mim][NTf2] for identifying the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6 in [C4mim][NTf2], the original BPC6, the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] and the BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] solution before and after irradiation at 500 kGy were analyzed using high-resolution ESI-MS with a positive ionization mode. Fig. S1 exhibited the ESI-MS spectra of the original BPC6 and the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf]. As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at m/z = 728.418 and m/z = 749.353 are assigned to [BPC6 + NH4]+ (theoretical m/z = 728.416) and [BPC6 + K]+ (theoretical m/z = 749.345), respectively. As illustrated in Fig. S1(b), compared with the original BPC6, the peak intensity of [BPC6 + NH4]+ and [BPC6 + K]+ in the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] is reduced, indicating that concentration of original BPC6 decreases during irradiation. In addition, several new signals were observed in the high-resolution ESI-MS spectra of the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf], listed in Table 1. The product at m/z = 796.403 with relative high signal intensity is corresponded to [BPC6-CF3 + NH4]+, the substitution product between BPC6 and radical dotCF3 radical (P2, theoretical m/z = 796.403). Imidazolium substituted BPC6 ([BPC6–C4mim]+) is also observed at m/z = 847.493 (P3, theoretical m/z = 847.489), which is formed due to the recombination between BPC6 and [C4mim]radical dot or [C4mim]2+radical dot radicals. Moreover, after trifluoromethyl substituted BPC6 generates, it is easier to form secondarily substituted radiolytic products. For instance, the peak at m/z = 1005.507 is designated for [BPC6–4H–2CF3–C4mim + H2O]+, the multiple substitution radiolytic product (P12, theoretical m/z = 1005.506). The radiolytic products that have lower m/z than the initial m/z of BPC6 were scarcely observed, indicating that during irradiation, the BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] solution system prefers substituted products. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1, similar radiolytic products were found in the irradiated BPC6/[C4mim][NTf2] system at 500 kGy, indicating that radiolysis behavior of BPC6 in both [C4mim][OTf] and [C4mim][NTf2] is semblable. The experimental result demonstrated that it is feasible to study the radiation effect of BPC6 with hydrophilic [C4mim][OTf] instead of hydrophobic [C4mim][NTf2].

In order to ascertain the chemical structure of the substituted radiolytic products, the energy differences between the various products with different substitution groups and different substitution sites were calculated. Geometry optimization of each species was based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory and the calculated results are illustrated in Table 2 and Scheme 1. For the substitution products formed by BPC6 and the methyl moiety of imidazolium cation (BPC6-Pa(n)), when compared with the methyl substituted isopropyl of BPC6 (BPC6-Pa(1)), the methyl substituted benzene ring of BPC6 (BPC6-Pa(5)) showed the lowest relative energy (ΔE = −79.5 kJ mol−1) and indicates that the formation of a methyl substituted product on the benzene ring of BPC6 is relatively easier than that on the isopropyl or crown ether of BPC6. Similar results were observed for the substitution products formed by BPC6 and trifluoromethyl (BPC6-CF3(n)) or the butyl moiety of imidazolium cation (BPC6–Pb(n)), which shows the most negative relative energy for BPC6-CF3(5) (ΔE = −15.6 kJ mol−1) and BPC6–Pb(5) (ΔE = −31.4 kJ mol−1), respectively. In addition, by comparing the energy of BPC6-Pa(5) and BPC6–Pb(5) shown in Table S3, it is easy to conclude that the benzene ring of BPC6 is more easily substituted by the methyl moiety than butyl moiety on the imidazolium cation. Generation of multiple substitution products can also be explained based on the above results. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. S3, compared with the original BPC6, BPC6-CF3(5) and BPC6–2CF3(5) are more likely to react with hydrogen radicals to form the multiple substitution products BPC6-CF3(5)-2H and BPC6–2CF3(5)-4H, which is consistent with the observation of multiple substitution products in ESI-MS results. Therefore, it can be proposed that the optimal substitution site is on the benzene ring of BPC6, para-position to isopropyl, and a variety of multiple substitution products will form during irradiation.

Scheme 1. Substituted radiolytic products of BPC6 with various substituent groups and substitution sites.
For the purpose of assessing the impact of radiation on the extraction performance of BPC6/IL systems without the disturbance of the water-soluble radiolytic products generated from ILs during irradiation (Ao et al., 2013a, 2015a), the [C4mim][OTf] diluent was removed from the irradiated BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] system using a water-washing step. After drying, the precipitate was dissolved in unirradiated hydrophobic [C4mim][NTf2] to prepare a 0.015 mol L−1 solution. The extractability of Cs+ was investigated afterwards. It was reported that the CCE extracting agents have fast extraction kinetics with ca. 10 min to achieve the extraction equilibrium (Xu et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2004a, 2004b). In order to avoid the effect of extraction time, the equilibrium at 30 min was chosen in our experiments. Since during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, the extraction system will be under acidic conditions, both neutral and 1 mol L−1 nitric acid aqueous solutions were considered in the following experiments.
As shown in Fig. 6, for the neutral aqueous solutions, the partitioning of the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] in combination with unirradiated [C4mim][NTf2] system decreases upon increasing absorbed dose due to the radiolysis of BPC6 during irradiation. To be specific, the distribution ratio of Cs+ decreases from 2659 to 33.4 at 500 kGy with extraction efficiency reducing from 99.9% to 97.0% (Table 3). Although the overall extraction performance was lower than that found under neutral conditions on account of the competition effect of HNO3 (Xu et al., 2010), a similar tendency was still observed for the aqueous solution containing 1 mol L−1 nitric acid. Based on the above characterization experiments and calculation results, the decrease in extraction performance was attributed to the formation of radical substitution products generated during irradiation, which leads to the loss of BPC6. However, even after 500 kGy irradiation, the distribution ratio was as high as 7.9 and the extraction efficiency was 88.8% when an aqueous solution containing 1 mol L−1 nitric acid was extracted, indicating that the radiation stability of BPC6 in IL was satisfactory and the radiolytic products may still possess partial extraction ability for Cs+.

Furthermore, DFT calculations were employed to explore the extractability of relatively stable substituted radiolytic products, BPC6-CF3(5) and BPC6-Pa(5). For the 1:1 ratio complexes formed between Cs and the BPC6 or the substituted radiolytic products, the changes in enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy (298.15 K, kJ·mol−1) were calculated in gas phase and in [C4mim][NTf2] by the M062X/6-311G++(d,p)/LANL2DZ level. As shown in Table 4, the extraction reaction between Cs and the original BPC6 exhibits the most negative ΔGsol (−44.8 kJ mol−1), while the formation of complex between Cs and BPC6-CF3(5) or BPC6-Pa(5) becomes relatively more difficult (ΔGsol = −32.8 or −24.6 kJ mol−1). Combining with the ESI-MS and Cs+ extraction experimental results shown in Table 1, Table 3, it can be concluded that with the increase of the absorbed dose, the decrease of the extraction performance is attributed to the concentration decline of the original BPC6 as well as the generation of the substituted radiolytic products. Nevertheless, the extraction performance does not decrease drastically even at 500 kGy, because the trifluoromethyl substituted BPC6, a relatively abundant substituted radiolytic product, still keeps partial extractability for Cs+.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the analysis of BPC6 in [C4mim][OTf] before and after irradiation has been carried out successfully by means of separating the water-insoluble radiolytic products of BPC6/[C4mim][OTf] through the removal of ILs with water-washing. Changes in chemical structure of BPC6 in ILs after irradiation as well as the influence on the Cs extraction were studied. Experimental results showed that during irradiation, radicals generated from IL such as [C4mim]radical dot, [C4mim]2+radical dot, CF3radical dot and Hradical dot would attack BPC6 to form substituted radiolytic products. Secondarily substituted radiolytic products based on trifluoromethyl substituted BPC6 were observed, indicating that substitution by trifluoromethyl would lead to further substitutions. ESI-MS testified that the extracting agent has similar radiolysis behavior in both [C4mim][OTf] and [C4mim][NTf2]. Theoretical calculations showed that the radicals prefer to attack the para-position to isopropyl on the benzene ring of BPC6. The decrease of the extraction performance with the increasing absorbed dose is due to the concentration decline of the original BPC6 as well as the generation of the substituted radiolytic products. However, the extraction performance does not decrease drastically during irradiation, because the relatively abundant trifluoromethyl substituted BPC6 remains partial extractability. The identification of water-insoluble radiolytic products provides a new strategy for studying the γ-radiation effect of ionic liquid extraction systems used in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.
