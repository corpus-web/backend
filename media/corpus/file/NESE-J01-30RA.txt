<Section>Abstract</Section>
The stability behavior of a simply-supported tube subjected to narrow annular flow in a finite-length gap support at the mid-length of the tube is experimentally investigated. For the experiments, a simply-supported tube and several finite-length gap supports were made considering different gap sizes. Several diffuser angles at the downstream of the support were also tested, since it is believed that the pressure recovery at the exit of the support is much more important than pressure loss at the entrance of the support. In this study, we observed that the tube lost its stability by flutter, and that the critical flow velocity at which the tube lost stability was dependent on the annular gap size and the diffuser angle. Interestingly, the tube with the diffuser angle of 10° lost stability at a lower flow velocity than with the diffuser angle of 20°, for relatively narrow gaps that are in the range of 0.018 to 0.042 gap-to-tube diameter. Differently, for the largest gap of 0.138 gap-to-tube diameter, the diffuser angle of 20° resulted in a lower instability flow velocity. We concluded that there may be different instability mechanisms depending on diffuser angle and related to the narrowness of the gap.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Considerable effort has been made to develop methodologies to predict the instabilities of a flexible rod subjected to annular- or leakage-flow-induced vibration. As a result, several methods to predict the dynamic behavior have been developed. These include the linearized potential flow theory based model (Mateescu and Paidoussis, 1985, Mateescu and Paidoussis, 1987, Mateescu et al., 1988), and the pressure-loss models (Hobson, 1982, Spurr and Hobson, 1984, Fujita and Ito, 1992, Langthjem et al., 2006, Kang et al., 2012). By virtue of these models, it is known that in annular flow, a rod simply-supported at both ends (pined-pined) loses its stability by divergence at very high flow velocity. It is also known that the only way that dynamic instability can occur for the pinned-pinned rod is via generation of a travelling wave. This may be possible for very long flexible rods, which are, however, not generally used for engineering structures such as in nuclear power plants.
Miller (1970) was the first researcher to study the dynamic instability of annular-flow-induced vibration using a simple flow restrictor moving in 1-D translational motion in the direction normal to the axial flow.
Hobson (1982) proposed an analytical model for a rod vibrating in a leakage-annular-flow channel. Neglecting the fluid velocity perturbation in the radial direction, the dynamics of a 1-D rigid cylindrical body was studied to investigate the role of fluid boundary conditions from the viewpoint of aerodynamic damping. He showed that the system can lose stability by flutter with divergent flow boundary conditions at the downstream end. Spurr and Hobson (1984) later showed experimentally that negative aerodynamic damping could be possible for a diffuser angle of 4° or more. Hobson’s theory was validated by the experiments of Fujita and Ito, 1992, Fujita et al., 1994. They verified that the system lost stability in the cases of a divergent configuration at the upstream end and a diffuser configuration at the downstream end, but not for the straight or convergent channel.
Parkin and Watson (1984) reported the vibration problem of a fuel rod in a gas cooled reactor. They showed experimentally that the instability mechanism in a 30° diffuser is predominantly a forced vibration due to vortex shedding, while that of a 6° diffuser originates from the pressure recovery characteristics of the diffuser. This was a very important discovery which served as a guideline for research on aerodynamic negative damping.
A rigid rod moving periodically in a finite-length annular-gap support was studied by Mulcahy (1980) to investigate fluid forces and hydraulic damping. In his study, tests were performed in still water, so that a pressure recovery could not be simulated at the exit of the finite-length support. Consequently he found only positive damping in terms of annular gap and length. The hydraulic damping increases with decreasing gap size and increasing annular length.
Mulcahy (1984) reported on a cantilevered tube conveying water which showed self-induced-excitation by leakage flow through a slip joint. He found that a limit cycle is attained below the flow rate at which the tube hits the wall, and that at high flow rate the unstable motion switched from the tube first-mode to predominantly second-mode motion. As in Hobson’s one-degree-of-freedom study, Mulcahy (1988) studied the hydrodynamic negative damping considering fluid viscosity.
Gorman et al. (1987) reported the fluid-elastic vibration of a thimble tube in a pressurized water reactor. In the study, a diffuser nozzle, straight hole nozzle and split square nozzle which has four vertical radial grooves were utilized. The researchers found that large vibrations occurred with the diffuser nozzle.
Yasuo and Paidoussis (1989) investigated the flow-induced instability problem of heat exchanger tubes subjected to axial flow in a diffuser-shaped, loose intermediate support. In their study, a diffuser of finite length and potential flow theory to determine fluid forces were considered together with a one-mode approximation of the inner tube. The researchers proposed a critical flow velocity equation for either divergence or flutter.
As with Yasuo and Paidoussis, to tackle industrial problems such as heat exchanger tube and control rod vibrations in gas and water cooled reactors, the practical conditions provided by the tube-support plate geometry should be considered. For heat exchanger tubes, the support causes leakage flow (highly confined annular flow) and sometimes, additional divergent or convergent flow at the exit or the entrance of the support, which is due to chamfering of the support hole for manufacturing convenience. Therefore, when it comes to heat exchangers, leakage flow over a finite length and divergent or convergent fluid boundary conditions should be considered in addition to the basic annular flow.
By virtue of previous research work, it is known that a pressure recovery at the exit of the support is far more important than pressure loss due to the reduction of annular flow at the upstream end of the support. In accordance with the work, we consider a simply-supported tube and several finite-length gap supports having different gap size and diffuser angles at the downstream of the support for the experiments.
The aim of this study is, therefore, (1) to verify experimentally the dynamic instability from a simply-supported rod with a finite-length gap support, (2) to measure the critical flow velocity for several annular gaps and diffuser angles of the support at the mid-length of the tube, and (3) to investigate the relationship if any between critical flow velocity and the annular gap size and also the diffuser angle.
<Section>2. Experimental setup</Section>
The test section with associated instrumentations is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Experiments were conducted in a 2.2 m long test section in which the flow rate ranged up to a flow velocity of 12 m/s. A 2.2 m long and 15.9 mm (0.627 in.) diameter inner tube was used with a mid-support (finite-length narrow-gap support) having a length of 38.7 mm (1.525 in.).
Fig. 1. Schematic drawing on the test section (a) Inner cylinder and instrument setup (b) Dimensions near support.
Several geometries of the axisymmetric mid-support were investigated. The inner tube was supported by four pins at one end, therefore, a total of eight contact points for both ends to simulate pinned-pinned boundary conditions. With these support conditions, the first and second natural frequency of the tube were measured at 12.5 Hz and 40.2 Hz, respectively. The following gaps between the inner tube and supports were tested: 0.29 mm, 0.42 mm, 0.67 mm, and 2.2 mm. Once dimensionless gap (denoted by gD,) is defined as the gap divided by the outer diameter of the tube, the four gaps can be rewritten, respectively, as 0.018, 0.027, 0.042, and 0.138 in dimensionless form. The basic annular gap between the inner tube and outer plastic glass tube was 5.17 mm (gD = 0.324). Diffuser angles of 10° and 20° were provided at the downstream end of the support.
Compressed air comes into the test loop through a pressure regulator connected to the building services air supply. The air meets a contraction at the entrance to the test section due to the tube support, enters the annulus provided by the lower glass tube, and then, flows into the much smaller annular channel provided by the replaceable support. The air flow is controlled by a valve at the end of the test loop, so that higher flow velocities can be obtained by opening the valve. Air compressed up to 100 psig (6.8 atm.) was used, where the maximum density of the air was approximately 8.5 kg/m3.
As indicated in Fig. 1, Vibration amplitudes are measured with four laser sensors (reflex sensor, Wenglor Company), in two directions near the support, at mid-span and at the one-fourth position along the test section, so that the vibration trajectory of the tube in a 2-D plane at two elevations of the tube length can be measured. The measurement signals are acquired and analyzed using an Oros data acquisition system.
At a given flow velocity, vibration amplitudes for two perpendicular (x- and y-) directions were measured in time domain, and transformed into the frequency domain. Then, after the maximum amplitude at the first mode (12.5 Hz) was determined for each direction, the representative amplitude of the tube at the flow velocity was calculated as the square-root of the sum-of-squares of the amplitudes at the first mode in the two directions. Because the vibration in the first mode is so dominant, and eventually, the tube lose its stability in this mode, the estimation of the vibration amplitude of the tube in the first mode was very important.
The damping at the 1st natural frequency is estimated from the power spectral density of the amplitude with a least-square curve-fitting method using the Matlab software. Fig. 2 shows the curve fitting and number of measurement points, which reveals almost no difference between cases where the 12-point measurements and 24-point measurements are used to estimate the first mode damping of the vibrating tube for different flow velocities.

<Section>3. Experimental results</Section>
The measurement accuracy of the flow velocity was particularly important because the critical phenomenon of the tube dynamics occurred at the very low flow rate (flow velocity). An uncertainty analysis showed that the estimated error for the flow velocity was less than 1.56%. For the detailed error analysis of the flow velocity and other parameters such as pressure and vibration displacement, readers can refer to Appendix A.
In this section, we present experimental results on 1) the vibration amplitude and damping of the first mode of the inner cylinder, for each support, depending on flow velocity, 2) the vibrational trajectory (x-y plot) of the cylinder motion in the support, from when the cylinder starts to vibrate with large amplitude to when the cylinder vibration diminishes, and 3) the first and second mode natural frequency dependence on flow velocity.
Since the air flow velocity is the most important parameter in this study, a reduced flow velocity (UR) was used to also allow comparison with previous work. The dimensionless reduced velocity is defined as follows:
(1)UR=VfD
where, V is upstream flow velocity in m/s, f is the first natural frequency (Hz), and D is the outer diameter (OD) of the tube in meters. To provide important information on the nature of the flow, some results are depicted using the Reynolds number, which is defined as follows:
(2)Rey=ρVDhμ
where, ρ is the density of the air, Dh is the hydraulic diameter of the upstream before the supports, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the air flow. In this experiment, the Reynolds number ranges approximately between 350 and 23,000.
In addition, the vibration amplitude was expressed as a dimensionless amplitude, denoted by a/H, defined as the ratio of the vibration amplitude to the tube-support gap size.
The inner pinned-pinned cylinder loses its first mode stability at very low flow velocity for all support cases. The first instability is clearly observed in the first mode. The instability is of dynamic type, not a static divergence. This conclusion is based on several factors. The critical flow velocity is too low to overwhelm the stiffness of the steel cylinder by negative fluid stiffness. Furthermore, the natural frequencies do not change prior to the inner cylinder impacting with the support. In addition, clear limit cycles are observed near the critical flow velocities for all the supports. Then, as the inner cylinder starts impacting the support, the “effective” damping ratio increases, and accordingly the first natural frequency slightly increases while the amplitude decreases.
3.1. Tube vibration amplitude and damping
Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the dimensionless vibration amplitude, and damping factor as functions of the upstream reduced flow velocity for each support gap and diffuser angle. All measurements for the different support geometries show the same trend, that as vibration amplitude rapidly increases at a certain flow velocity, damping starts to decreases simultaneously. This flow velocity is hereafter called the critical flow velocity.

Fig. 5. Vibration amplitude and damping ratio and as a function of reduced flow velocity (UR) for the cylinder in gD = 0.042 (0.67 mm) with 10° and 20° diffuser angle.
Fig. 6. Vibration amplitude and damping ratio and as a function of upstream reduced flow velocity (UR) for the cylinder in gD = 0.138 (2.20 mm) with 10° and 20° diffuser angle.
In the case of the support having gD = 0.0182 with 10° diffuser, as shown in Fig. 3, the vibration amplitude starts increasing rapidly below UR = 0.5. At the same time the damping ratio has decreased to the lowest value measureable in the tests. We observe the same behavior at approximately UR = 1.0 for the support having the same gap with a 20° diffuser.
ForgD = 0.027 case, the critical flow velocity is found to be UR = 1.0 for the 10° diffuser as shown in Fig. 4 where the amplitude increase and the damping decrease rapidly. For the 20° diffuser, the same phenomenon occurs at approximately UR = 3.0. The amplitude starts increasing at UR = 2.2, remains relatively constant in the range of UR = 2.8–3.4 m/s, and then starts increasing again at UR = 3.4.
Fig. 5 shows that vibration amplitudes and damping for the support of gD = 0.042 start moving up and down, respectively, just before UR = 0.4 m for the 10° diffuser, and UR = 2 for the 20° diffuser. This is significantly lower than we expected for the support of gD = 0.042 with 10° diffuser. The gap of gD = 0.042 is the second largest one of experiments. It was initially expected that larger gap and diffuser angle would lead to high critical flow velocity. For the experiment with the same gap with a 20° diffuser angle, the vibration amplitude increases up to UR = 0.8, decreases a little at UR = 1.2, increases again up to UR = 2.4, where the maximum amplitude occurs. For higher flow velocity, the amplitude decreases again, and then bounces back at approximately UR = 3.4. The maximum relative amplitude near UR = 2.4 is measured as a/H = 0.45, which is the smallest one in these experiments.
For the tube support having gD = 0.138 with 10° diffuser angle, the instability phenomenon occurs at UR = 14.2 as shown in Fig. 6. In the case of the 20° diffuser, the critical flow velocity is found near UR = 6, which is much lower than with 10° diffuser. It is an interesting result that the 20° diffuser shows a lower critical flow velocity than the 10° diffuser. This is opposite to the result obtained with smaller gaps in the range of gD = 0.0018 (0.29 mm) togD = 0.027 (0.67 mm).
3.2. Tube motion in X-Y plane
Details of the tube motions in the x-y plane at the support elevation are presented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14. In each case figure (a) shows the tube trajectory in the x-y plane. The corresponding tube amplitude and frequency are shown in Figure (b) and (c), respectively. In all cases, whirling motions are clearly observed although a skewed circle is observed in some cases. It is known that the limit cycle is the result of a dynamic instability. Once impacting starts, the elliptical cycle disappears. When the cylinder contacts the support, the cylinder seems to vibrate in a one-dimensional motion. This is a very typical vibration behavior for all the supports with increasing flow velocity.

Tube vibration behavior of gD = 0.138 (2.2 mm) with 20° diffuser as flow velocity (UR) increases: (a) tube motion in x-y plane at the mid-length of the tube at UR = (1) 6.58, (2) 7.09, (3) 8.11, (4) 9.14, (5) 10.17, (b) amplitude with flow velocity, (c) natural frequency with flow velocity.
While the vibration amplitude and the damping change, the natural frequency of the cylinder does not change at all before the onset of impacting, as shown in (b) amplitude and (c) natural frequency plots of Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The 12.5 to 13.0 Hz and approximately 40 Hz components are, respectively, for the first and the second natural frequencies. The natural frequencies are little different from those measured without air flow. However, when the inner cylinder starts impacting, the first natural frequency increases slightly while the second mode frequency does not change. Physically, impacting increases not only the effective damping but also the effective stiffness of the tube so that the effective natural frequency is slightly higher as a matter of course.
Fig. 7 (a) shows the x-y plots of the tube motion at the support elevation for the least gap, gD = 0.0182 with 10° diffuser. As the amplitude increases (see also Fig. 7 (b), whirling motions start to be observed at UR = 1.0 in the form of a skewed cycle. The whirling motion evolves more clearly at UR = 1.0, and then disappears at UR = 1.29 when impacting starts. When the tube contacts the support, the tube vibrates in approximately a one-dimensional motion.
In Fig. 8, the motion of the tube is shown in the support having gD = 0.027 with 20° diffuser. As the flow velocity increases from UR = 1.11 to UR = 1.5, the limit cycle evolves in terms of size and clarity. Impacting starts at UR = 1.64, which is slightly higher than the flow velocity yielding the biggest cycle. The first natural frequency increases slightly at UR = 1.64.
Fig. 9, Fig. 10 show the x-y plot of the tube motion at the support elevation for gD = 0.042 with 10° diffuser, and the same gap with 20° diffuser, respectively. From these two supports, we observe more clearly the evolution of the rod vibration from small amplitudes to a limit cycle with flow velocity. As shown in the figures, the limit cycle appears at UR = 1.5 for the 10° diffuser, and UR = 3.87 for the 20° diffuser.
As shown in Fig. 11, the tube vibration behavior for gD = 0.042 with 10° diffuser is simple: the amplitude increases with flow velocity, a limit cycle appears and evolves from a small cycle to a large one, while from Fig. 12, for the same gap with 20° diffuser, the vibration amplitude repeats the trend with flow velocity, while the limit cycle appears and disappears accordingly, at the same velocity. The first limit cycle forgD = 0.042 appears at UR = 0.59 (Fig. 11 (a)) and UR = 1.96 (Fig. 12 (a), respectively, with 10° diffuser and 20° diffuser, respectively.
The vibration behavior for the gD = 0.138 (2.2 mm) case is shown in Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The gap of 2.2 mm is the biggest one tested in the experiments. The limit cycle appears at UR = 17.52 with the 10° diffuser and UR = 7.09 with the 20° diffuser, respectively. The trajectory of the cylinder with the 10° diffuser seems to be unnatural, especially when the cylinder vibrates in a limit cycle. Since we focus a laser beam on the circular surface of the tube, the laser beam became unfocused when the tube vibrated in too large amplitude. We believe that the intermittent loss of focus would be a reason why the skewed cycle of x-y plot is observed sometimes such as in Fig. 13. The tube motion is, however, still believed to be a limit cycle motion.
<Section>4. Discussion and conclusions</Section>
It is well known that a cylinder (or rod) pinned at both ends and subjected to axial flow loses its stability by divergence (static instability). Few studies that have shown the possibility of dynamic instability of the pinned-pinned tube. In this study, it is shown by experiment that the pinned-pinned tube could become dynamically unstable with a support having small chamfer at the downstream side. Tubes with chamfered supports and subjected to high speed axial flow (e.g. in steam generators) may be potentially susceptible to such a dynamic instability.
The stability behavior of a pinned-pinned flexible cylinder subjected to narrow annular flow over a finite-length gap support was experimentally investigated. For these experiments, the critical flow velocities were measured for varying gap size and diffuser angle of the finite-length support.
For the 2.2 m long steel tube, and 3.87 cm long supports, and significantly low air flow, flutter instability was observed for all supports; independently of the gap size and diffuser angle. With annular flow (along its full span), the simply supported cylinder is known to first lose stability by divergence, but at very high flow velocity well beyond practical engineering applications. Remarkably, a small support played a significant role to change the dynamic behavior of the pinned-pinned rod, and decreasing the critical flow velocities down to engineering (low) flow velocities.
As a general trend, as shown in Fig. 15, smaller gaps and smaller diffuser angles lower the critical flow velocity for flutter instability. More precisely, within the annular gap range of gD = 0.0182 (0.29 mm) to gD = 0.042 (0.67 mm), in this study, a diffuser angle of 10°is found to lead to a lower critical flow velocity than diffuser angle of 20°. On the other hand, for the largest gap gD = 0.138 (2.20 mm), the critical flow velocity of the larger diffuser angle (20°) is lower than that of the smaller diffuser angle (10°), as shown in Fig. 15. For the largest gap of gD = 0.138, the instability mechanism appears to be different from the smaller gap case. The Reynolds number for this experiment ranges between 350 and 23,000, as shown in Fig. 15.

Vibration amplitude of the pined-pined cylinder with finite-length narrow-gap support as a function of upstream reduced flow velocity (UR), Reynolds number, variation of the support gap from gD = 0.0018 (0.29 mm) to 0.138 (2.2 mm) and of the diffuser angle of 10° and 20° at the downstream side.
As with Parkin and Watson’s discovery of two instability mechanisms (1984), in a certain range of small gaps, the fluid pressure recovery at the diffuser may produce an instability in the system, where the smaller diffuser angle triggers instability with ease at lower flow velocity. For the larger gap size, we hypothesize that a different mechanism underlies the instability. The bigger diffuser angle more easily causes the instability or forced vibration at lower flow velocity, which is clearly shown in Fig. 15. The larger gap size coupled with a wider diffuser angle provides space for larger size flow perturbations. Flow separation resultant free shear layers can, perhaps, lead to instabilities akin to stall flutter. Separated free shear layer oscillations akin to vortex shedding may induce larger perturbations with larger diffuser angle. The tube with a larger diffuser angle support more susceptible such perturbations and can easily lose stability as our experimental results revealed.
While the underlying flow physics related to the narrow gap has not been fully explained in the foregoing, the experimental results may, however, be an important discovery which could serve as a guideline and valuable data source for research on the aerodynamic instability.
In this study, for the pinned-pinned cylinder subjected to leakage flow in a finite-length gap support at its mid-length, the critical flow velocity with compressed air (ρ≈8.5kg/m3) turned out to be less than 3 m/s (UR = 17.52) at the most, which is within the range of most engineering applications. This result has important practical implications.

<Section>Appendix A. Error analysis and measurement uncertainty</Section>
(1)Flow rate measurement
The outer diameter of the inner tube and the inner diameters of four supports were manufactured according to tolerance of ±0.001. The uncertainty of the tube and the supports would be ±0.16% (±0.001/0.627) and ±0.25 for the worst one (±0.001/0.650), respectively. Thus, total manufacturing uncertainty (Merr) would be ±0.3% that was evaluated by square-root-of-sum-of-square of each tolerance.
Since the temperature of compressed air came from the building supply service, the temperature of the air could vary only slightly. The variation of ±1 °C was considered, which gives an error bound of ±0.3% for flow rate (or flow velocity).
For the gas flow rate, a flow meter model GFC77 manufactured by AALBORG was used. The flow meter can measure up to 1000 L/min. According to the specification for the range provided by the manufacturer, an accuracy of ±1.5% can be applied. Total flow velocity uncertainty is estimated as follows:
(A1)Uerr=±UST2+Utemp2+Merr2
where, UST is the standard uncertainty of flow meter (±1.5%), Utemp for the error of ±0.15%/◦C for temperature variation of air. Based on the above, the estimated error for the flow velocity is less than 1.56%.
(2)Measurement of vibration displacement
Laser displacement sensors (Wenglor Company) were used to measure the vibration displacement of the tube while A Or38 (Oros system) 32-channel Data Acquisition (DA) system was used to analyze the measurement data from the laser sensors.
For vibration measurements, the temperature effect could be neglected. Total uncertainty of the displacement measurement could be evaluated as follows:
(A2)Serr=±Sres2+Slin2+Smet2+DAAbs,i2+DAAbs.o2
where, Sres is the sensor resolution error of 2.76% at speed mode, Slin is the sensor linearity error of 0.1% in speed mode, Smet is the sensor metering precision of 0.2%, DAAbs,i and DAAbs,o are the DA absolute error of 0.034% (±0.05 dB out of 144 dB full range) each for data input and output. Therefore, the estimated error for vibration displacement could be 2.77%.
