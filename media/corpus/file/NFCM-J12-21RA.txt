Abstract
Chemically modified fibrous bio-adsorbent extracted from banana trunk was synthesized for potential application in adsorption of heavy metal from wastewater. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) polymer graft was first introduced onto the fiber through electron beam irradiation technique. GMA-grafted fiber was subsequently functionalized with imidazole (IMI) group through epoxide ring-opening reaction where amine density of 2.00 mmol/g was achieved. The adsorbent was characterized with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). An extensive kinetic and mechanistic study on the adsorptive removal of metal ions (Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+) by IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted banana fiber is presented. The effects of pH and initial concentration on adsorption capacity were investigated. The adsorption data were correlated with pseudo-first and second order model and the isotherms were analyzed with Langmuir and Freundlich model in order to explain the kinetics and adsorption mechanisms of different metal ions. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption process for metal ions was exothermic. We also demonstrated that the IMI-GMA-grafted fiber can be regenerated using dilute HNO3 solution, and can be recycled up to 10 times while maintaining satisfactory adsorption performance. Lastly, the chemically modified bio-sorbent was used to treat a local domestic sewage water.

1. Introduction
Water is considered the most essential resource in all kind of industrial sectors where water is used for production, processing, washing and rinsing as well as cooling purposes. Industrial activities consume large amount of water hence producing tremendous amount of heavily polluted wastewater. Typical discharge from manufacturing industries (food products, textiles, paper, refined petroleum products, chemicals, metals, automobiles, etc.) could exceed million liters of wastewater per day for large factories. Such effluent may contain hazardous chemical by-products including highly toxic heavy metals. The exposure to heavy metals may impart alarming threats to human health and ecosystem. Several methods such as electrochemical treatment, coagulation, flocculation, reverse osmosis, floatation, ion exchange, chemical precipitation and adsorption can be used to remove toxic contaminants from the wastewater (Fu and Wang, 2011). Among them, adsorption can be regarded as one of the most attractive options for heavy metal removal due to its simplicity, high efficiency, ease of operation, and its ability to remove multiple components simultaneously.
Conventionally, natural minerals such as zeolite, clay, silica and activated carbons are employed for adsorbing heavy metals. These minerals were normally functionalized to increase the adsorption capacity towards dissolved metals (Karnib et al., 2014). In recent years, various novel adsorbents have been synthesized in the laboratory such as carbon-based materials (carbon foam, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) (Hassan et al., 2014, Reddy et al., 2015, Reddy et al., 2009), magnetic nanoparticles (Reddy et al., 2016, 2007), modified biopolymers (derived from chitin, chitosan, starch) (Zhang et al., 2012), and hydrogels (crosslinked hydrophilic polymers) (Han et al., 2018). A number of studies have also shown that cellulosic fibers from plants and agricultural wastes such as wood pulp (Abdel‐Aal et al., 2006), sawdust (Yu et al., 2000), non-woven cotton fabric (Sekine et al., 2010) and banana trunk (Shibi and Anirudhan, 2006) also can be used as heavy metal adsorbent.
Banana fibers is rich of lignocellulosic, consisting of helically wound cellulose (50%) microfibrils in amorphous matrix of lignin (24–25%) and hemicelluloses (17%) (Sathasivam and Haris, 2010) reported high removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of pre-treated banana trunk fibers towards various heavy metal ions (Cd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+). Chemisorption studies of functionalized banana trunk fibers were extended to the adsorption of Ni2+ and Pb2+ (Barreto et al., 2010; Shibi and Anirudhan, 2005) functionalized the polyacrylamide-grafted lignocellulosic fibers with carboxyl groups to increase its affinity towards Co2+ ions. The adsorption of polymer-grafted banana fibers for various transition metals have also been recently tested (Kajiyama et al., 2014). In our previous study, we have demonstrated the technique for producing polymer-grafted banana fibers with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) by irradiation-induced graft polymerization using electron beam (Selambakkannu* et al., 2014). GMA contains epoxy group which amenable to post chemical modification. The main obstacle faced by lignocellulosic fibers on radiation graft polymerization process is the presence of phenol rings in lignin molecular structure (Ghosh et al., 1994). Therefore, pretreatment is crucially required in order to partially remove the lignin. We have also investigated the extent of delignification of banana fiber via acidic chlorite method with consideration of various process factors (Selambakkannu* et al., 2014). The most optimum conditions chosen for delignification process was 0.8% NaClO2, 6 h and 70 °C whereby the lignin content of lignocellulosic banana fiber was reduced from 22.45% to 11.91%. At these conditions the required yield for grafting was obtained which is suitable to be developed as adsorbent. Complete removal of lignin is not suitable for the aimed purpose as the fibers will turn into pulp at extreme acidic chlorite method.
Here we report our work on functionalization of GMA-grafted banana fibers with imidazole (IMI) via epoxide route. IMI is an organic compound in which two out of five atoms that make up the ring are nitrogen atoms. IMI is a moderate-donor and a weak-acceptor. IMI functions as a donor and acceptor falls in between saturated amines (e.g. ammonia) and unsaturated amines (e.g. pyridine) (Sundberg and Martin, 1974). Therefore, IMI is hypothesized to function as auxiliary binding sites for metal ions, which would enhance the adsorption capacity of the bio-sorbent better than other types of amine groups. We have conducted extensive metal ion uptake studies which include the effects of pH and contact time on adsorption of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+, the kinetic models, adsorption isotherms, and the evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters. On top of that, desorption and regeneration studies were also reported. Finally, the adsorption performance of the newly developed bio-sorbent derived from banana trunk fiber was evaluated using a domestic sewage wastewater.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The polymer trunk derived from lignocellulosic banana fibers were generously supplied by Innovative Pultrusion Sdn. Bhd. (Seremban, Malaysia). Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, 97%), polyoxyethylene sorbitol ester (TWEEN 20), imidazole (IMI, 99%, 68.08 g/mol) and Isopropanol (IPA, 99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (M) Sdn. Bhd. (Subang Jaya, Malaysia). The Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ solutions for metal ions batch adsorption studies were prepared from 1000 ppm standard solutions (Merck Sdn. Bhd., Bandar Sunway, Malaysia). All chemicals were of analytical grade.
2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Irradiation-induced polymer grafting
Prior to grafting, the banana fibers were partially delignified using NaClO2 via acid chlorite method described elsewhere (Selambakkannu* et al., 2014). 1.0 g of delignified fibers was placed in a polyethylene zipper bag and filled with nitrogen (N2) to replace the air present inside the bag. The sample was irradiated at dry ice temperature in a conveyer-type electron beam accelerator (EPS 3000 Nissin High Voltage, Japan). Technical specifications of EPS 3000 are; accelerator voltage: 0.5–3.0 MeV, beam current: 1–30 mA, max beam power: 90 kW and conveyor speed: 1–20 m/min. The sample was irradiated with 30 kGy electron, 2 MeV voltage, and 10 mA current, with irradiation time of 0.5 min. The selected electron beam irradiation condition was most appropriate for natural fibers and also sufficient to attain required grafting yield. The irradiated sample was transferred into a glass ampoule and vacuumed for 1 min. Emulsified monomer solution comprising of GMA/TWEEN 20 (3:1 ratio) was transferred into the glass ampoule containing the irradiated fibers. The glass ampoule was placed in a 40 °C water bath for 1.5 h for grafting reaction to take place. Finally, the polymer-grafted banana fibers were dried in an oven at 50 °C overnight. The grafting yield, Dg, was calculated as:

where, Wo and Wg represent the mass of the specimen before and after grafting process.
2.2.2. Polymer-graft functionalization
0.5 g of the grafted fibers were mixed with 60 mL of 30 vol% IMI in isopropanol solution which subsequently placed inside a water bath at 60 °C for 1.5 h. During this period, the epoxy group of the GMA is broken to bond with the IMI. The functionalized fibers were thoroughly washed with ultrapure water to remove the excess reactants followed by drying in an oven at 50 °C overnight. The amine group density, AD (mmol/g) was calculated by:
@(2)
where Zi and Zo denote the mass of the fiber before and after functionalization, and M is the molecular weight of the IMI, 68.077 g/mol.
2.3. Characterizations
2.3.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The sample imaging was done with scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi-SU350) at 15.0 kV and 0.2 mA voltage and current, respectively. Resolution of 10 nm was used, with magnifications range of 500 times. The samples were coated with thin layer of platinum before imaging.
2.3.2. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
The chemical functionalities of GMA- and IMI-GMA-grafted-fibers were characterized with FTIR (Nicolet IS10, Thermo Fisher Scientific) under wavenumbers ranging from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 at resolution of 4 cm−1 with single reflection diamond universal attenuated total reflection (ATR). The averaged scan was over 32 times.
2.3.3. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The samples were analyzed for its thermal stability with Thermogravimetric Analyzer (Pyris 1 TGA, Perkin Elmer). The samples were heated from room temperature to 700 °C, with heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Nitrogen flow was maintained at a rate of 50 mL min−1.
2.3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC-PHI Quantera II [Ulvac-PHI, INC.]) was used to examine the adsorptive interactions between metal ions and IMI-GMA-grafted fiber. An X-ray source: monochromatic Al-Kα (hv = 1486.6 eV) which operated at 25.6 W (beam diameter of 100 µm) was used for the XPS analysis. Samples were fixed on the sample holder using double-sided tape. Wide scan analysis was performed using a pass energy of 280 eV with 1 eV per step. Narrow scan (chemical states analysis) was performed using a pass energy of 112 eV with 0.1 eV per step. Prior to de-convolution, charge correction was performed at C 1s by setting binding energies of C-C and C-H to 284.8 eV. The XPS MultiPak version 9.8.0.19 was utilized to deconvolute the XPS spectra.
2.3.5. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction analysis was done with Shimadzu XRD 600 x-ray diffractometer at room temperature. The instrument operating condition was nickel filtered CuKα (λ = 1.542 A) at 30 kV and 30 mA. Data were collected from 2θ of 2° to 30° at rate of 1°/min. XRD was used to identify the changes in crystalline fraction structure of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber post- and pre-metal adsorption process.
2.3.6. Point charge zero analysis
pH drift method was used to determine the point charge zero of the samples. Briefly, 50 mL of distilled water was filled into a jacketed glass ampoule at room temperature. The dissolved gases were removed by nitrogen bubbling through the solution. The dissolution of O2 could also be avoided. The pH of the solutions was adjusted from 2.0 to 12.0 by using 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH. 0.5 g of banana fibers was added to the solution and placed on orbital shaker for 3 h. The final pH was measured and plotted against the initial pH. The point of zero charge was determined at which the initial pH is equal to final pH.
2.4. Adsorption/desorption experiment
2.4.1. Effect of pH on metal ion adsorption
0.05 g of fiber was immersed into a 50 mL of 10 ppm metal ions (Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+) solution when the pH of metal ion solution was varied from 2 to 9 with 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. The metal ion solution was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Finally, the solution was filtered using a 0.4 µm membrane filter. 1 mL of the filtered solution was analyzed with Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS, Perkin Elmer AA-800) to measure the metal ion concentration.
2.4.2. Effect of contact time on metal ion removal
Metal ion solution with various concentration of 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 75 ppm, 100 ppm and 150 ppm were mixed with 0.1 g of fiber and stirred into 100 mL Florence flasks at room temperature. The pH of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ solutions was fixed to approximately 4.0. Aliquot from supernatant solution was collected at a predetermined time interval. The aliquots were analyzed as described in the previous section. The equilibrium adsorption by the adsorbent, qe (mg/g) was estimated using Eq. (3):
@(3)
whereby, Ci and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations (mg/L) of metal ions, V (mL) is the volume of the metal ion solution and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent. The adsorption data of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ ions are expressed in kinetic models: first order by Lagergren, and pseudo second order. Origin Pro 8.0 was used to formulate linear regression parameters namely r2 and slope. The rate constant of adsorption, k1 for first order was derived from the slope of the plot log (qe − qt) versus time. The rate constant of adsorption, k2 for second order was calculated from the slope of the plot 1/qt versus 1/t.
2.4.3. Desorption studies
Desorption experiments were carried out on metal ions saturated-fibers where HNO3 was used as eluent reagent. 0.05 g of metal ions saturated-fibers were immersed into 50 mL of 0.5 mol/L HNO3 solution. The mixture was placed onto orbital shaker and samples were collected at predetermined time intervals. The collected eluent samples were subjected to analysis with AAS after filtration. The amount of metal ions desorbed from metal ions saturated-fibers was calculated using Eq. (4):
@(4)
2.4.4. Regeneration studies
0.05 g of fibers were treated with 50 mL of 100 ppm metal ion solutions and after reaching equilibrium time (3 h) the samples were filtered. The metal ions saturated-fibers were then treated with 50 mL of 0.5 mol/L of HNO3 solution for 1 h. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to metal analysis for metal ions desorbed. The cycle was repeated until the adsorption capacity reached a plateau.
3. Results and discussion
The reaction scheme for GMA polymer grafting on the pre-treated banana fibers with the aid of electron beam followed by the integration of IMI onto the GMA-grafted banana fibers are shown in Fig. 1. The bombardment of high energy electrons onto the pre-treated banana fibers will lead to the protonation of hydrogen atom which leaves oxygen as active radicals by energy transfer to OH molecules of banana fibers cellulosic backbone (Dahlan and Unit, 1994). Subsequently, the GMA monomer can be added to the cellulose backbone with active radicals by the double bond that exists in GMA. Thermo-kinetic process was responsible for the bond fission and formation of unstable radicalized molecules. Rapid reaction had to occur in order to form GMA-grafted copolymers on the fibers. The chemical structure of GMA contains epoxy group, which can act as a precursor for binding with other reactive groups. Initially, protonation of epoxide will take place with the presence of IMI in isopropanol solution (acidic medium). Consequently, the amine (nucleophile) from IMI will eventually attack the most substituted position in order to form GMA-IMI bonding. As a result, IMI and OH will be trans-oriented and another onto GMA molecule (Chakraborti and Kondaskar, 2003). Generation of new functional groups for ion exchange or chelate formation takes place upon the opening of the epoxy ring in GMA. Based from our previous works, our irradiation method produces GMA-grafted fibers with a 100% grafting yield (Selambakkannu* et al., 2014). These highly grafted samples are perfect for further functionalization since the number of epoxy groups available are optimal. At the end of the functionalization, the yield of amine density was calculated to be 2.00 mmol/g.

3.1. Characteristics of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted banana fibers
3.1.1. SEM imaging
The morphology of the delignified banana fiber and its polymer-grafted fibers are portrayed in Fig. 2. At microscopic scales, the investigated banana fibers possess a yarn-like structure, conformed in an ordered parallel manner. The individual fibril is approximately 20 µm. The pristine fiber is loosely packed in contrast to the polymer-grafted and the functionalized fibers. The ridges among the fibrils observed for the pristine fiber had diminished presumably due to the polymer coating which increase the intrachain interaction. Nevertheless, the difference between GMA-grafted with IMI-functionalized GMA fiber is not apparent from SEM observation. The success of IMI-functionalization should be further characterized using spectroscopic technique.

3.1.2. FTIR analysis
The FTIR spectra for both GMA-grafted fibers and IMI-GMA-grafted fibers are displayed in Fig. 3. The common stretching found on GMA-grafted fibers are O-H stretching at 3340 cm−1, C-H stretching at 2919 cm−1, C=C at 1632 cm−1, and C-O stretching of cellulose at 1016 cm−1. The peaks detected on the fibers are due to grafting of GMA was located at 1721 cm−1 and 1251 cm−1 assigned for C=O and C-O stretching vibration which originates from –COO– ester group of GMA and the epoxy characteristic peak revealed at 1251 cm−1, 904 cm−1 and 842 cm−1. Additional stretching was found on IMI-GMA-grafted fibers such as N-H stretching at 3280 cm−1, N-H bending at 1599 cm−1, and C-N alkyl group stretching at 1235 cm−1. Note that the stretching corresponds to the epoxy group in GMA are missing in the IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers. This indicates that the epoxy sites of the GMA were fully substituted by the IMI. Successful addition of other types of amine group onto cellulosic materials have also been reported by other researchers (Madrid et al., 2013, Nada et al., 2008). Stretching found on the GMA-grafted fibers and IMI-functionalized fibers are summarized in Table 1.

3.1.3. TGA analysis
The thermogravimetric curves for GMA-grafted and IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers which are shown in Fig. 4. The GMA-grafted fiber exhibits two-steps thermal degradation while its IMI-functionalized counterpart demonstrates three-steps thermal degradation. Note that the degradation of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber initiated at a lower temperature in comparison to that of GMA-grafted fiber. Initial weight loss in IMI-GMA-grafted fiber within the temperature range of 29–110 °C is associated to the loss of water from the samples. IMI-functionalized fiber is presumed to be more hydrophilic hence retaining higher adsorbed water molecule. A fairly drastic degradation occurred at temperature range of 225–450 °C. The mass loss was approximately 45% in this particular region, while the mass loss for the GMA-grafted fiber within this temperature region is significantly higher (89%). At the end of the run, the mass residue for IMI-GMA and GMA-grafted fiber were approximately 20% and 7%, respectively. The –NH2 present in the functionalized fiber could act radical scavenger which deliberately delay the degradation of the sample (Zaharescu et al., 2000). This holds the explanation for the enhanced thermal degradation of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber compared to that of unfunctionalized GMA-grafted fiber.

3.1.4. XPS analysis
Previously, several studies had reported results from X-ray photoelectron spectra on metal adsorbent particularly on amine based biosorbents (Deng and Ting, 2005, Montes‐Atenas and Schroeder, 2015, Ren et al., 2016). Fig. 5. shows the C1s core-level spectra for the GMA-grafted fiber, IMI-GMA-grafted fiber-pre Pb2+ ion adsorption and IMI-GMA-grafted fiber-post Pb2+ ion adsorption, respectively. GMA-grafted fibers exhibit peaks at 248.78, 286.42, 287.64 and 288.57 which denotes to C–C, C–O, C=O and COOH bonding. Meantime, IMI-GMA-grafted fiber-pre Pb2+ ion adsorption reveal peaks at 248.51, 285.66, 286.71, 287.65 and 288.78 which denotes to C–C, C–N, C–O, C=O and COOH bonding. This observation supports the claim of functionalization of GMA-grafted fiber with IMI by opening of epoxy ring. Fig. 6. show the XPS Pb4f spectra onto IMI-GMA-grafted fiber-post Pb2+ ion adsorption. The binding energies spotted at 138.43 and 140.16 eV which is assigned for Pb2+ onto IMI-GMA-grafted fiber-post Pb2+ ion adsorption. This finding is considered as supporting evident for adsorption of Pb2+ by IMI-GMA-grafted fiber after adsorption process.

3.1.5. XRD analysis
Changes in crystalline fraction structure of the ungrafted, GMA-grafted fiber and IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber were analyzed in this study. The XRD pattern obtained displayed in Fig. 7. The GMA-grafted fiber with grafting yield 100% and IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber with amine density 2.00 mmol/g were utilized for this analysis. The crystalline peaks for all three ungrafted, GMA-grafted fiber and IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber emerge at the same angle, 2θ. The main peaks of cellulose crystallinity were found at 16.0° and 22.0° which characterize the cellulose crystallographic planes (Pereira et al., 2013). This signifies that the grafting and functionalization process didn’t imply any changes in the crystalline structure of the fibers. But, variation in reflection peak intensity was clearly seen in GMA-grafted fiber and IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber in comparison to ungrafted fiber. Variation in crystallinity region might be due to dilution of inherent crystallinity by incorporation of GMA and IMI via extreme chemical conditioning at amorphous region of banana fiber.

3.2. Metal ion uptake studies
3.2.1. Influence of pH on Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ion adsorption
Generally, the surface charge of solid adsorbents is highly dependent on pH. This factor would strongly affect the heavy metal of the adsorbent (Esposito et al., 2001, Kratochvil and Volesky, 1998, Naja et al., 2005, Pagnanelli et al., 2003). pH drift method was used to determine the point of zero charge of the IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers as shown in Fig. 8. The pH of point of zero charge for IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers lay around 3.25. The results suggested that the fibrous adsorbent possesses an acidic surface. We can infer that the adsorption of metal would be low for pH values lower than the pH of point of charge zero because the surface charge of IMI functionalized fibers will be positive hence it is unfavorable for cations adsorption. Apart from that, competition of H+ ions with metal ions for the active site also contribute towards the lower sorption capacity (Martín-Lara et al., 2009). At pH higher than pH of point of charge zero, the surface charge of IMI-functionalized fibers will be negative and binding of metal cations are mostly favourable. However, the final pH value is greater than initial pH value which can be ascribed to the precipitation of heavy metal ions (Khormaei et al., 2007). Thus, most suitable pH for metal ions adsorption by IMI functionalized fibers is around 3.25.
Fig. 8. Determination of pH zero point of charge by pH drift method.
Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ aqueous solutions with 50 ppm concentration were prepared for batch adsorption experiment at different pH and the result is shown in Fig. 9. At low pH regime, the adsorption of metal ions (represented by the removal percentage) is low for types of metals. Protonation of IMI is more likely to take place at a low pH due to the presence of high amount of H+. Electrostatic repulsion forces will build up between positively charged metal ions and the adsorbent leading to a reduction in metal ion uptake. Later, a sharp increase in metal ion sorption was observed as the pH increased. Maximum adsorption occurred at pH 3.00 for all the metal ions. The removal percentage is slightly lower as small amount of adsorbent were used for the adsorption and also the contact time haven’t been optimized yet. Beyond the pH of 4.00, precipitation of metal hydroxide was observed during the experiment and that's contribute towards the higher metal ion removal at higher pH. This observation supports the results obtained for pH of point of charge zero. Furthermore, the efficiency of amine group which present on IMI is sensitive towards pH. The function of amine as adsorption functional group inhibited at any pH more than pH 4. The metal ion adsorption mechanism by IMI-functionalized fibers can be schematically represented by Fig. 10. The ionic radiusd, for Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ are around 1.18, 0.57 and 0.74, respectively. Five membered chelate ring (IMI) with the lone pairs on the nitrogen will focus on creating an N-M-N chelating. The prospect of utilizing chelate ring size to control ligand selectivity for metal ions is dependent on their size. The decrease in complex stability also strongly correlated with metal ion size. Thus, five membered chelate rings, IMI will do best with large metal ions, of high coordination number, which creates a small N-M-N bond angle (Hancock, 1992). Even though the formation mechanism of N-M-N chelating is the same for all Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions but the selectivity is higher for Pb2+ due to its larger size.

3.2.2. Influence of contact time onto Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ion adsorption
The adsorption capacity of IMI-GMA-grafted banana fiber towards Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions was as a function of time is demonstrated in Fig. 11. The pH of each metal ion solution was adjusted to predetermined optimum pH which is around 3.25. Amine group becomes inert ay any pH more than pH 4. Moreover, at higher pH metal ions tend to form metal hydroxide which leave adverse effect on removal efficiencies.
Fig. 11. Adsorption time profile for Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ ion solutions (100 ppm) onto IMI-GMA-g-fiber.
The equilibrium adsorption capacity, qe for Cu2+ increased from 20.2 mg/g to 71.6 mg/g when the initial concentration of the metal ion solution was about 25 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. However, the removal capacity reduced from 90% to 71.6%. Similar trend was obtained for Pb2+ and Zn2+. Adsorption capacity for Pb2+ increased from 17.1 mg/g to 84.2 mg/g, and Zn2+ from 13.7 mg/g and 60.1 mg/g, while the removal capacity reduced from 85.3% to 64.2%, and 80.3% to 60.7%, respectively. qt represents the amount of metal ions adsorbed on definite mass of IMI-GMA-grafted banana fiber adsorbent at a time, t. The result obtained clearly indicates that the uptake of metal ions is strongly dependent on initial metal ion concentration. The number of total adsorption sites are limited since the adsorbent dose was fixed throughout the experiment. The unit of adsorbent dose is expressed in the form of mass of adsorbent per volume metal ion solution, g/L. Thus, availability of adsorption sites on the absorbent will be lesser as the concentration of metal ion increases. At higher concentration, further increase in adsorption rate could be achieved by increasing the amount of adsorbent. The adsorption data of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber in this study had shown a tremendous improvement in its adsorptive capability towards metal ions in contrast to GMA-grafted fiber reported in our previous publication. In similar studies conducted by Madrid et al. (2014) on metal ions adsorption by amine functionalized hyacinth fibers the adsorption capacity obtained for Pb2+ and Cu2+ were around 73.47 mg/g and 65.54 mg/g. Another study conducted by Showkat et al. (2007) on removal of Cr (VI), As (V), Pb (II) and Hg (II) ions by adsorption onto amino-functionalized ordered mesoporous silica had shown good adsorption capacity which was prepared with ETAB. Meanwhile, adsorption capacity of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber of for Pb2+ and Cu2+ was around 84.2 mg/g and 71.6 mg/g.
3.3. Adsorption kinetics
Based on the adsorption data as a function of time discussed previously, the adsorption kinetic of our adsorbent can be evaluated. Adsorption rate of metal ions onto the functionalized banana fibers can be determined using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (Chiou and Li, 2003, Semerjian, 2010). The expression of pseudo-first order equation in differential form is displayed in (5):
@(5)
The pseudo-first order linear expression, also recognized as Lagergren equation, is given below (6) at the integrating boundary condition qt = 0 at t = 0 to qt = qt at t = t:
@(6)
Where k1 (min−1) represents pseudo-first order constant, while qe and qt signify the amount of metal ions adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium state. Pseudo-first order constant, k1, and equilibrium adsorption amount, qe, are derived from slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln(qe − qt) versus t as shown in Fig. 12.
Fig. 12. Pseudo-first order plot for the adsorption Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ ion solutions (100 ppm) onto IMI-GMA-g-fiber.
The pseudo-second order differential expression is given below in (7):
@(7)
Rearrangement of the integrating formula into linear equation of pseudo-second order as manifested below in Eq. (8) is more suitably used in solid-liquid adsorption system (Goel et al., 2011):
@(8)
where k2 (g/mg min) represents the rate constant for pseudo-second order adsorption process and the rest of the parameters are similar to pseudo-first order kinetic model. Pseudo-second order constant, k2 and equilibrium adsorption amount, qe are derived from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of t/qt versus t as shown in Fig. 13.
Fig. 13. Pseudo-second order plot for the adsorption of Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ ion solutions (100 ppm) onto IMI-GMA-g-fiber.
The pseudo-first order and second order kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It was found that the kinetics adsorption of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber for Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions correlated well with pseudo-second order kinetic model in contrast to that of pseudo first-order kinetic model. This indicates that the reaction is more inclined towards chemisorption. Therefore, metal ions and surface of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber intact by chemical bond formation by metal chelating. Moreover, the experimental maximum adsorption capacity found to be in good agreement with theoretical maximum adsorption capacity for Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions. The similar outcome obtained in a study conducted by Zhang et al. (2017) on removal of removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions by amine functionalized cellulose pretreated with microwave-H2O2.

3.4. Equilibrium of adsorption
Mathematical models that define the distribution of adsorbate species in between solid and liquid phases are known as adsorption isotherms. Adsorption isotherms plays a vital role in the determination of adsorption mechanism. Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption data of the IMI-GMA-grafted fiber.
3.4.1. Langmuir adsorption isotherms
Langmuir adsorption isotherm is expressed in linear form as shown in Eq. (9). Langmuir isotherms presume mono-layer adsorption with fixed numbers of identical active sites onto adsorbent surface.
@(9)
Where qe is the amount of adsorbed dye (mg/g), Ce equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate (mg/L), aL and KL refer to Langmuir isotherm constants. The plot of Ce/KL versus Ce gives a straight line where aL/KL and 1/KL are represented as the slope and intercept, respectively. The theoretical monolayer saturation capacity, qmax could be obtained from Eq. (10):
@(10)
Fig. 14 exhibits the linear plot for Langmuir isotherms for the adsorption of all three metal ions by IMI-functionalized fibers. The Langmuir adsorption parameters from these isotherm plots are tabulated in Table 3. High coefficient of determination values, r2 were obtained for adsorption of Zn2+ and Cu2+ metal ions. Moreover, the agreement between qexp and qmax values predicted from Langmuir isotherm model for adsorption of Zn2+ and Cu2+ metal ions suggested that adsorption Zn2+ and Cu2+ obeys Langmuir model for the entire concentration range studied. In addition, adsorption of Pb2+ metal ion resulted in lower r2 values and poor agreement between qexp and qmax estimated from Langmuir model indicated adsorption mechanism of these metal ions does not follow the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacity for Pb2+ metal ions was found to be higher in comparison to Cu2+ and Zn2+.

The dimensionless separation factor RL, can be defined in terms of Langmuir adsorption constant as shown in Eq. (11).
@(11)
Where Co is the initial dye concentration (mg/L) and aL is the Langmuir adsorption constant (mg/L). The dimensionless separation factor, RL value is used to identify the nature of the adsorption process. The RL value categorizes the modes of adsorption as either unfavorable at RL > 1, linear at RL = 1, favourable at 0 < RL < 1 and irreversible when RL = 0 (Treybal, 1980). The variation in RL values with the initial concentration of metal ion solution is shown in Fig. 15. It shows that the separation factors are inversely proportional to initial concentration. The separation factor for all three metal ions fall in the range of 0 < RL < 1. Therefore, the separation factor analysis implies that the adsorption process of metal ions onto IMI-functionalized fibers for all three metal ions were reversible and favourable within the concentration range studied. The changes in separation factor as the initial concentration of metal ions increases signifies the shifting of adsorption process from favourable to irreversible adsorption.

3.4.2. Freundlich adsorption isotherms
Freundlich isotherm model mathematically described the adsorption onto heterogeneous surfaces including the interaction between adsorbed molecules regardless the formation of layers. The Freundlich adsorption isotherms is expressed in linear form as displayed in Eq. (12).
@(12)
Where qe is the amounts of molecules adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g), Ce equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate (mg/L), Kf is the Freundlich constant, 1/n is the heterogeneity factor correlated to the adsorption capacity and intensity. The plot of ln qe versus ln Ce represents Kf and 1/n values via the slope and intercept, respectively. The adsorption process is considered as favourable and beneficial if the exponent value (n) lies between 1 and 10. A higher n value indicates stronger adsorption intensity. Meanwhile, higher Kf values represent higher adsorption capacity. Adsorption of metal ions were plotted in the linear form of Freundlich model is shown in Fig. 16. Freundlich isotherm parameters are displayed in Table 3. The coefficient correlation for Freundlich isotherm for Pb2+ metal ions were > 0.97 at 30 °C. Adsorption of metal ions onto IMI-functionalized fibers possess n > 1 values which indicates that a beneficial and favourable adsorption process had taken place. Kf values are relatively higher for adsorption Pb2+ which agrees that the adsorption capacity of IMI-functionalized fibers towards Pb2+ is higher.

3.5. Evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters
Thermodynamic study was conducted in order to define the spontaneity and viability of the adsorption process carried out by the IMI-GMA-grafted fiber. The experimental data on metal ion adsorption as a function of temperature were used to determine the variation in thermodynamic adsorption parameters such as Gibbs free energy (∆G°), enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°). Spontaneity of adsorption process is designated by the change in Gibbs free energy, yet the value falls in negative range if significant adsorption ensues (Ahmad and Kumar, 2010). The change in Gibbs free energy of the adsorption was calculated from the Gibbs-Helmholtz Eq. (13):
@(13)
where T represents the temperature of the solution (K), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) and Kc denotes the adsorption distribution coefficient. Eq. (14) shows the correlation between Gibbs energy (∆G°) with enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°).
@(14)
The plot of Gibbs energy (∆G°) versus temperature (K) is shown in Fig. 17 and the values of thermodynamics parameters for the adsorption of metal ions onto IMI-functionalized fibers are displayed in Table 4. The negative value of enthalpy (∆H°) suggest that the adsorption process is exothermic. This may be the results of ligands formation in between metal ions and IMI functionalized fibers (Fig. 10). Moreover, the negative value obtained for Gibbs energy (∆G°) supports the practicability and spontaneity of the metal ions adsorption by IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers within the temperature range studied (27–70 °C). In addition, the positive value for entropy (∆S°) specifies the increase in the disorder on adsorption (Goel et al., 2011, Fu and Wang, 2011). A similar outcome has been reported in the literature on metal ion adsorption by carbon derived cellulose (Yakout and Elsherif, 2010).

3.6. Desorption and regeneration studies
Desorption of metal ions from IMI-functionalized fibers was carried out using 0.5 mg/L of HNO3 solution and samples were collected at several time intervals. Fig. 18 shows the desorption efficiency versus its contact time. Desorption efficiency increases with contact time and saturation was reached after 50 min. Maximum desorption of Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ was 98.87%, 97.70% and 99.56%, respectively. The desorption process with HNO3 solution took place principally due to ion exchange between proton, H+ and metal ions on the active sites present on IMI-GMA functionalized fibers (Mohan et al., 2002).
Fig. 18. Desorption of Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ ions from the saturated IMI-GMA-g-fiber using 0.5 mg/L HNO3 solution.
The IMI-functionalized fiber was also subjected to adsorption-desorption processes up to 10 cycles. The results shown in Fig. 19 demonstrated that the metal ion removal efficiency is gradually decreases to about 65% after 10 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. The decrease in removal of metal ions as the increase in number of regeneration cycles was due to reduction in mechanical strength of banana fibers itself. Banana fibers basically loses its mechanical integrity as the numbers of regeneration cycles increases. Both extensive chemical and mechanical process mostly responsible for it. Previously, study on regeneration of banana stem fibers after subjected to adsorption of Hg2+ had reported six cycles of elution with 0.1 M HCl (Salamun et al., 2016). Reduction in adsorption capacity was observed during six cycles of regeneration and the same trend were attained in current study. This shows that the use of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fiber can be regenerated for multiple times or maximized by mixing with fresh adsorbents after few adsorption-desorption cycles.

3.7. Application studies on real domestic sewage effluent
The viability of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers as metal ion adsorbent was determined on real sewage water collected from local domestic area. The concentration of Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ found in domestic sewage waste were around 48.53 ppm, 73.21 ppm and 42.72 ppm, respectively. The adsorption was carried out at optimum batch conditions which was 0.05 g of IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted fibers in 50 mL of domestic sewage effluent at pH 3.25. The results obtained presented in Fig. 20. A 100% removal of metal ions of interest was achieved within 1 h of contact time. This test confirmed that bio-sorbent derived from fodder crops, in our case, banana trunk could be modified and utilized as an effective and economical solution for combatting threatening environmental issues.

4. Conclusion
An extensive kinetic and mechanistic study on the adsorptive removal of metal ions by IMI-functionalized GMA-grafted banana fiber has been conducted. Characterizations on the bio-sorbent revealed that the density of IMI functionalized onto GMA-grafted fiber was calculated to be 2.00 mmol/g. The IMI-functional group was responsible for the efficient removal of metal ions from the aqueous solutions. Based on the overall findings, the adsorptive removal of metal ions per unit mass of adsorbent is strongly dependent on the initial metal ion concentration. The uptake of metal ions was increased as the initial concentration of metal ions increases. However, the removal percentage reduced as the initial metal ion concentration increases due to the saturation of adsorbent. The adsorption kinetics of IMI-GMA-grafted fiber fitted well with the pseudo-first order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm models were applied onto metal adsorption data in order to corroborate the adsorption mechanism. The adsorption of Zn2+ and Cu2+ metal ions were found to obey the Langmuir isotherm model, whereas the adsorption of Pb2+ metal ions followed the Freundlich isotherm model. Thermodynamic studies revealed that metal ions adsorption process was exothermic as a result of metal ion ligand formation with the imidazole group. Saturated IMI-GMA-grafted fiber could be efficiently regenerated using dilute HNO3 solution and subsequently recycled up to 10 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles while maintaining excellent removal efficacy. Finally, IMI-GMA-grafted fiber was used to treat metal-laden water from a local domestic sewage and proved its viability as an effective and economical bio-sorbent. Although there were no selectivity studies on adsorption of metal ions from real domestic sewage effluent, it is of our best interest to report its metal ions selectivity comprehensively in our future studies.
