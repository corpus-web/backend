<Section>Abstract</Section>
In this paper, a numerical procedure for thermal–hydraulic subchannel analysis of the annular fuel assembly in a PWR using the drift-flux model (DFM) is presented. The system of nonlinear equations was solved with a fully-implicit solution scheme using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. To improve the computational efficiency and numerical stability of the JFNK method, a semi-implicit physics-based preconditioner was implemented. To validate the present method, various annular fuel arrays with different operating conditions were modeled, and the results were compared with the results of other codes. The key thermal–hydraulic parameters were in good agreement and the difference in total pressure drop values obtained by different methods was less than 2%. Also, it was found that the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) of the outer channel was significantly larger than the inner channel, and the heat split ratio of the inner surface to the outer surface was approximately 1.4.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The energy produced by the nuclear power plants is one of the most important sources of energy supply in the world. Currently, this energy is generated by the fission within nuclear reactors. Dual-cooled annular fuels have been proposed as an alternative to the conventional solid fuels to improve the power density by 50% while maintaining sufficient safety margins, Hejzlar et al., 2001, Feng et al., 2007. Due to the benefits of this type of fuel, there has been much research in the use of annular fuels. Part of this research has focused on neutron discussions (Xu et al., 2007), and some on thermal–hydraulic issues (Han and Chang, 2003, Feng et al., 2007, Shin et al., 2012) and some on thermo-mechanics (Yuan, 2004, Deng et al., 2016).
In 2007, Feng et al. (2007) modified the VIPRE-01 code to investigate the thermal–hydraulic performance of annular fuels for the Westinghouse reactor with a power of 3411 Wt. In this study, different arrays (from 11 × 11 to 15 × 15) of annular fuels were investigated, which in some arrays (13 × 13) have the potential to increase the power up to 50%. In Korea, extensive research has been carried out on the use of annular fuels in the OPR-1000 light water reactors (Shin et al., 2012). Han and Chang (2003) developed the Thermal-Hydraulic analysis code for Annular Fuel (THAF) code coupled with MATRA code to analyze the thermal–hydraulic of the annular fuels. In recent years, to expand the use of annular fuels in India's new generation heavy water reactors, Vishnoi et al., 2012, Deokule et al., 2014, Deokule et al., 2015 have investigated the use of annular fuels in advanced heavy water reactors. In these studies, they have developed SAAP (Sub-channel Analysis of Annular Pin bundle) software. This software also runs using COBRA-IV-I software.
Current subchannel analysis codes such as COBRA-EN (Basile et al., 1999), MATRA (Yoo et al., 1999), and VIPRE-01 (Stewart et al., 1983) are not capable of modeling annular fuel assembly. Computationally, the distribution of heat and fluid flow into the internal and external channels is unknown, because one of the most critical issues in the thermo-hydraulic analysis of annular fuels is to find the amount of internal and external fluid flow and heat split between the internal and external channels. The computational methods implemented in these codes are also computationally expensive. Hence, more accurate methods with less computational cost are needed, and the researches to develop a subchannel code with annular fuel modeling capability have been continued.
In the most recent study, Xia et al. (2019) developed a Sub-channel Analysis Code for Annular Fuel (SACAF) capable of thermo-hydraulic modeling of annular fuels. In this study, the homogeneous flow model was applied for two-phase flow modeling, also the closed channel model is used to define the internal channels, and the open channel model is used to define the external channels. In this paper, the finite difference method is applied to solve the mass, momentum, and energy equations.
In recent years, many efforts have been made to model two-phase flow in a vertical channel using the DFM based on the advanced fully implicit method such as JFNK (Zou et al., 2016, Hajizadeh et al., 2017a, Hajizadeh et al., 2017b, Hu et al., 2017). Based on these studies, one can conclude that using the JFNK method with an efficient preconditioner can lead to faster convergence and reduced computational cost. So far, these methods have not been widely applied to the reactor core thermal–hydraulic modeling using subchannel analysis. Downar and Joo (2001) investigate the application of preconditioned Krylov method for solving the two-phase flow continuity equations in the VIPRE-02. They found that a preconditioned Krylov method has a significant effect on the reduction of the CPU time and convergence rate of the two-phase flow equations. Therefore, in this study, the thermal–hydraulic performance of the annular fuel assembly is modeled using the subchannel method by efficient techniques.
<Section>2. Development of the subchannel program</Section>
Extensive efforts have been made in the last few decades to model the fuel assembly of light water reactors in transition conditions. A comparison with a set of experimental data has shown that subchannel analysis codes can predict thermo-hydraulic parameters accurately, Moorthi et al., (2018). For the two-phase flow modeling, the homogeneous model, two-fluid model, and the drift flux model are used. In different versions of COBRA (Wheeler et al., 1976), MATRA (Yoo et al., 1999) and VIPRE-01 (Stewart et al., 1983) the homogeneous model and in THERMIT (Kelly et al., 1981) the two-fluid model are used for two-phase flow modeling. In this paper, the DFM is used for thermal–hydraulic modeling of annular fuel assembly using subchannel analysis. The features and benefits of the DFM can be found in Ishii and Hibiki (2010). The following section presents the equations of mass, energy, and momentum of the two-phase flow for external channels, followed by a description of the required constitutive correlations.
2.1. Governing equations
In an annular fuel assembly, there are two types of channels. The first type is internal channels that are isolated from other channels and have no lateral connections to other channels. Therefore, transverse flow expressions are not considered for these channels. The second type is the external channels that are in communication with the other outer channels, and the mass, energy and, momentum exchange occurs along the channels. The external subchannel equations based on the DFM are as follows:
Mixture continuity equation:
@(1)
Continuity equation for vapor phase:
@(2)
Mixture enthalpy equation:
@(3)
Axial momentum equation:
@(4)
Lateral Momentum equation:
@(5)
In the present study, the mixture momentum equation is used in the non-conservative form, because the errors generated are small, and it is simple for numerical implementation (Lee and Park, 2013). For the sake of simplification, some researchers (Talebi et al., 2012, Hashemi-Tilehnoee and Rahgoshay, 2013, Hajizadeh et al., 2017b) ignored the transverse momentum equation but in the subchannel analysis of annular fuels must be taken into account. In the above equations,  and  stand for the enthalpy and axial momentum, respectively transported by the diversion cross-flow. Typical values for  and  are:
@(6)
where k is the adjacent sub-channel to sub-channel i. The cross flow resistance coefficient  consists of the frictional and the local pressure drop of the diversion cross flow, and its value is about 0.5 (Feng et al., 2007).
2.2. Constitutive relations
For closure of the system of equations, additional constitutive equations and equations of state for each phase are required. In this study, it is assumed that the vapor phase is saturated and the steam/liquid properties are determined from the IAPWS formulation 1995 (Wagner and Pruss, 2002).
The correlation of the Chexal and Lellouche (1986) is used to calculate the distribution parameter,  and the mean drift velocity, . These parameters indicate the effects of void distribution, and the relative velocity between the phases, respectively (Hibiki and Ishii, 2003). The Chexal-Lellouche model eliminates the need for two phase flow regime and covers a wide range of mass flux, pressure and channel size.
The distribution parameter and the mean drift velocity are given by:
@(7)
and
@(8)
The constants  and  are defined by Chexal and Lellouche (1986).
The vapor generation term, in the RHS of Eq. (2), the vapor phase continuity equation is predicted by the constitutive relations as:
@(9)
where  has two regions: close to the wall and the bulk regions. For close to the wall region, the volumetric vapor generation rate is calculated by the Lahey model (Lahey, 1978):
@(10)
where
@(11)
The volumetric vapor generation rate in the bulk region is modeled by Eq. (12):
@(12)
In the present simulation, the RELAP5 (Fletcher and Schultz, 1992) flow map and correlations for a vertical boiling channel is used to obtain the liquid-to-interface volumetric interfacial heat transfer coefficients, .
Constitutive correlations are needed to calculate the frictional pressure drop in single- and two-phase flows. In the single phase flow, the wall friction factor is the maximum value of the laminar (f = 64/Re) and turbulent (f = 0.32/Re0.25) values. The two-phase frictional pressure drop is evaluated by the two-phase multiplier concept. In this approach, the two-phase pressure drop correlates to liquid-alone or vapor-alone pressure drop with a two-phase friction multiplier. In this paper, the two-phase friction multiplier is computed by the Armand correlation (Stewart et al., 1977).
In this paper, the actual quality is computed by the Levy model (Levy, 1967), heat transfer coefficient calculated from the Dittus-Boelter correlation (Dittus and Boelter, 1985) for single-phase flow and the Thom correlation for subcooled and saturated nuclear boiling (Collier and Thome, 1994).
<Section>3. Numerical solution methods</Section>
In this section, the computational schemes implemented in this study are briefly discussed. The finite volume method is applied to the spatial discretization of the governing equations on a staggered mesh, Fig. 1. The JFNK method is used to solve the discretized system of nonlinear equations. The appropriate flow distribution model and heat split model between the inner and outer channels were applied for the more accurate analysis of the dual-cooled annular fuel pins.

By using the first-order upwind spatial discretization and the fully implicit backward Euler time integration scheme, discretization is carried out as follows:
Mixture continuity equation:

Continuity equation for the vapor phase:
@(14)

@(15)
Mixture enthalpy-energy equation:
@(16)
Lateral Momentum equation:
@(17)
3.2. Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov methods
Eqs. (13), (14), (15), (16), (17) represents a system of nonlinear equations. The JFNK method is used to solve the discretized system of the nonlinear equations. This method has been widely used in many disciplines (Knoll and Keyes, 2004), and different fields such as geophysical flows (Reisner et al., 2001), two-phase flow (Ashrafizadeh et al., 2015, Pope and Mousseau, 2009), atmospheric flow (Reisner et al., 2003), hurricane model (Kurihara and Ross, 1993), shallow-water model (Mousseau et al., 2002), ice sheet model (Lemieux et al., 2011), ocean model (Bernsen et al., 2010), Plasma Physics (Mousseau and Knoll, 1997) and radiation diffusion (Mousseau et al., 2000).
In recent years, one of the topics in which the JFNK method has been widely used is the modeling of the nuclear reactor core. The nuclear reactor core is a complicate, multi-physical system in which highly nonlinear neutronic, thermal–hydraulic, and heat conduction equations are coupled together. Many attempts have been made to use the Newton-Krylov method to deal with the multi-physics coupling. Zhang et al. (2018a), solved the coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics equations in PWR core transient calculation. In this work, the Jacobin matrix is obtained analytically, and an incomplete LU factorization (ILU) scheme is used to precondition the Krylov solver GMRES. Knoll et al. (2011), presented a JFNK algorithm for k-eigenvalue/criticality calculations. In this study, they used the power iteration and Wielandt shift to construct a block preconditioner. Also, Mousseau (2006) developed more accurate algorithms for the simulation of a nuclear reactor by using the second order in time physics-based preconditioned JFNK method.
A brief description of the JFNK scheme to solve a set of nonlinear algebraic equations follows. Newton's method is used to solve the systems of nonlinear equations (Saad, 2003) of the form,
@(18)
where F is the nonlinear residual for the unknown vector . Newton’s method solves Eq. (18) iteratively by solving a series of linear correction equations defined by:
@(19)
where
@(20)
and
@(21)
The matrix  is the Jacobian matrix, the superscript k is the Newton iteration index and  is the correction vector. The linear Eq. (19) is solved inexactly using the iterative Krylov solver GMRES (Saad and Schultz, 1986). The mth Krylov iteration is defined as follows:
@(22)
where
@(23)
where  is the initial guess of the linear solution. By using the preconditioner, the convergence of the GMRES algorithm is expected to be faster; therefore, to achieve a converged solution, fewer Krylov vectors are needed.
The computation and storage cost of the Jacobian coefficient matrix are significant and expensive for solving a large system of equations. One method to reduce the computational cost is to approximate the Jacobian matrix in Eq. (19) efficiently. In this procedure, the Jacobian matrix can be estimated by (Saad, 2003):
@(24)
where  can be formulated as (Pernice and Walker, 1998):
@(25)
In this study, thermal hydraulic performance of annular fuels has been investigated, therefore, modifications for reducing the condition number of the Jacobian matrix such as scaling technologies (Zhang et al., 2018b, Park et al., 2010), do not have much effect on the performance of the JFNK method. Hence, scaling technologies are not used. To reduce the condition number of the Jacobian matrix and improve the convergence rate of the numerical methods, instead of solving the linear system in Eq. (19), equations are solved using the iterative Krylov solver restarted GMRES with a right preconditioning (Hu et al., 2017). Using the right preconditioner, Eq. (19) can be written as follows:
@(26)
where P is the preconditioner and actually P−1 estimates J−1; therefore, if P ≈ J (P is closer to J), then solving the equations will be simpler. In this study, P is the preconditioning matrix that will be defined and constructed in the next section. The new matrix is now,
@(27)
where
@(28)
and
@(29)
Finally, the vector  is calculated in an iterative process from the restarted GMRES solver as:
@(30)
There are several preconditioning procedures to the JFNK scheme discussed by Knoll and Keyes (2004). Lately, much attention has been paid to the physics-based preconditioner (PBP) and JFNK methods with PBP developed by some researchers. To solve the coupled boiling two-phase fluid and heat transfer problems, Mousseau (2004) employed the JFNK method with PBP. Mousseau stated that any solution scheme that linked with a reasonable estimation of a time step for the problem could be utilized as a preconditioner. A PBP can be obtained from the semi-implicit discretization of the governing equations (Elman et al., 2008). Hu et al. (2017) proposed the JFNK method with an efficient PBP for the 1-D subcooled boiling two-phase flow in a vertical channel. They showed that a PBP could be obtained from the semi-implicit temporal discretization of the governing equations for one-dimensional DFM. They concluded that the JFNK method for the 1-D subcooled flow boiling shows good robustness and accuracy.
An adequate selection of the PBP can considerably decrease the number of Krylov vectors, thus reducing both the storage requirement and the computational time. In this paper, PBP is used to precondition the Krylov solver GMRES. This method has been successfully applied for a vertical boiling channel modeling (Hu et al., 2017). We will now show in detail how to construct the pre-conditioner matrix, P.
3.3. Construction of the preconditioner
Remember that the correction equation for Newton’s method is defined as follows:
@(31)
Usually, the linear discretization of the governing equations for a semi-implicit scheme on a staggered grid can be shown in the matrix form as:
@(32)
In this study, PBP is used, which requires to write the semi-implicit method compatible with Eq. (31) (Reisner et al., 2001, Reisner et al., 2003, Reisner et al., 20055; Mousseau et al., 2002). The “delta” form of the semi-implicit scheme is as:
@(33)
Regardless of the transverse momentum equation (Downar and Joo, 2001) and employing the semi-implicit method on the staggered grid, the discretization of the governing equations used in the preconditioning for each channel is as follows:
@(34)
@(35)
@(36)
@(37)
where, the superscripts n and n + 1 represent the old and new time steps, and Δt is the time step size. In Eqs. (34), (35), (36), (37), the convective terms and the pressure term in the continuity, momentum, and energy equations are evaluated at the new time level. In contrast, transverse flow and turbulent mixing terms, the enthalpy and axial momentum that transported by the diversion cross-flow (starred parameters), the wall friction term, and the wall heat source term are evaluated at the old-time level. These equations are obtained after substituting velocity correction equation, Eq. (38), into the mass equation and using the linear combination of mass and energy equations with simplifications.
@(38)
where
@(39)
@(40)
To write Eqs. (33), (34), (35), (36) in a form analogous to Eq. (31), the following relations will be used:
@(41)
@(42)
@(43)
@(44)
where  and  in Eqs. (41), (42), (43), (44) denotes the current solution of the linear equations. Eqs. (41), (42), (43), (44) are substituted into Eqs. (33), (34), (35), (36) to obtain the following equations:
@(45)
@(46)
@(47)
@(48)
Because the delta form of the semi-implicit preconditioner is used, therefore, for each channel Eqs. (44), (45), (46), (47) can be demonstrated in the vector form as:
@(49)
Eq. (49) is compatible with Eq. (31). As already mentioned, the coefficient matrix P in Eq. (49) is an approximation of the Jacobian matrix J in Eq. (31). Thus, the matrix P is employed for the preconditioning of the Jacobian matrix of Eq. (31). The detailed derivation of the components of the matrix P can be found in Appendix A.
3.4. Numerical solution scheme and flow distribution model
Fig. 2 shows the solution diagram. In this study, (1) the inlet temperature, (2) the inlet void fraction (usually αg = 0 at the inlet), (3) the output pressure, and (4) the inlet mass flow rate are applied as boundary conditions. The values of the initial-boundary condition parameters for the 13 × 13 fuel rod design benchmark calculation and sub-channel analysis are given in Table 2, Table 4, respectively.
Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of the calculation.
Table 1. Heat transfer fraction with different methods for the MIT 15 × 15 annular fuel design.
Table 2. Operating conditions for the 13 × 13 fuel rod design benchmark calculation.
Eqs. (45), (46), (47), (48) can be solved by the semi-implicit numerical solution method (Liles and Reed, 1978, Talebi et al., 2012) and then use this solution as a preconditioner as well as the initial guess of the Newton-Krylov iterations. In this paper, to improve the numerical stability as well as the convergence rate of the JFNK method, at the beginning of each time step the semi-implicit PBP method is used as preconditioning. Also, at the first time step, the semi-implicit method is only used to obtain an appropriate initial guess for the Newton-Krylov iterations. In the next time steps, the results at the last time step are used as the initial guess.
The following steps are performed at each channel to apply the semi-implicit method as a preconditioner:
In the new time step, the coefficients and right hand side of Eqs. (45), (46), (47), (48) from the values of the previous time step are calculated.
Tridiagonal pressure equation is solved to obtain the pressure distribution at each channel using a linear solver such as Krylov method or Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA).
Using the values obtained from pressure distribution, mixture velocity by Eq. (45) is calculated.
Using the new values of pressure and mixture velocity, hm and α are calculated from Eqs. (46), (47), respectively.
The newly updated vector , including  and  are transferred to the Krylov solver GMRESAfter construction of the semi-implicit PBP, Eqs. (13), (14), (15), (16) are then solved in a full-implicit manner. At this stage, the Eqs. (13), (14), (15), (16) are solved channel-by-channel. That is, for each subchannel, the above equations are solved simultaneously along the channel for all the axial levels.
In this paper, only Eqs. (13), (14), (15), (16) are fully implicitly solved for each channel, so for the construction of PBP consistent with these equations, the transverse momentum equation is neglected and the terms of the transverse flow are calculated in the previous time step (Downar and Joo, 2001). In the next step, for the external channels with new values obtained for pressure, enthalpy, vapor fraction, and axial flow rate for each cell, the transverse momentum equation is solved Plane-by-plane. In the plane-by-plane method, also called the level-by-level method, in contrast to the channel-by-channel method, the transverse momentum equation is solved simultaneously at a defined axial level for all the external subchannels. The axial velocity terms at the higher level (j + 1) are computed from the old iteration step, and the terms at the lower levels are calculated from the new values of the solution at the current iteration step.
In the next step, using the annular fuel model developed by Esmaili et al. (2019), the temperature distribution inside the fuel, as well as the surface temperature of the fuel rod and the heat transfer coefficients between the clad and coolant are calculated. In the next step, after calculating the heat transfer fraction of each channel and the pressure drop between the internal and external channels, their convergence is investigated. If convergence is not achieved, then the fully implicit solution of the equations is used, and the process is repeated until convergence criteria is achieved (the error in the calculation of the flow distribution and the heat split is within the acceptable range of error levels). After convergence, the above calculations are repeated for the next time step until tfinal is reached. It is worth mentioning that Eq. (49) is calculated only once at any time step, this means that, the preconditioning matrix P is calculated at the first Newton iteration only, or reused during other Newton iterations if needed.
For dual-cooled annular fuels, how the flow is distributed among the channels is of great importance and needs to be determined. The coolant flow distribution is such that it results in an equal pressure drop for all the subchannels. In this paper, the flow distribution model applied by Han and Chang (2003) is used. In this model, first, the pressure drop of each channel, as well as the mean pressure drop of all channels, is calculated. The total pressure drop for each channel consists of the acceleration pressure drop, the gravitational pressure drop, and the frictional pressure drop. For external channels, the pressure drop caused by the grid spacers is also considered. In the next step, the pressure drop of each channel is compared with the mean pressure drop, and their convergence is investigated. If the error of equal pressure drop across all channels were within the permissible range, the calculation would be moved to the next time step. Otherwise, the computation is repeated assuming a new flow distribution. This loop is repeated until it reaches a mass flow distribution that results in equal pressure drop across all channels.
3.5. Heat transfer fraction (Heat split model)
To find the heat split, thermal–hydraulic equations are first solved with an assumed heat flux. The temperature distribution inside the annular fuel is calculated by the orthogonal collocation method (OCM) (Esmaili et al., 2019) and then the heat transfer coefficients of the coolant are obtained. After that, the heat transferred to the inner and outer channels is calculated as follows:
@(50)
@(51)
where hi and ho are the heat transfer coefficient between the clad and coolant in the inner and outer channels, respectively. Also, Tw and Tb are the wall and fluid temperatures, respectively. Next, the convergence of qin and qout is examined. If the convergence criteria is achieved, the calculations will be moved to the next time step. Otherwise, the values of the parameters at this step will be used as the initial value for the next iteration. This process continues until convergence is achieved.
4. Verification of the code
To validate the present model, the numerical results of the MIT 15 × 15 annular fuel design (Fig. 3) modeling are compared with the results of THAF and RELAP5 code performed by Han and Chang (2003). In this study, the Korea Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNPP) was selected as the reference for the core operating conditions. In Fig. 4, Fig. 5 axial distribution of the heat flux in the inner and outer surfaces of the annular fuel rod obtained from the different methods is compared. Table 1 also presents the heat transfer fraction to the internal and external channels. The results show good agreement with different methods.
Fig. 3. Geometries in the 15 × 15 annular fuel unit cell.
Fig. 4. Comparison of axial heat flux of the outer channel.
Fig. 5. Comparison of axial heat flux of the inner channel.
In this study, in addition to 15 × 15 annular fuel design, the results of the VIPRE-01 code (Feng et al., 2007) for the 13 × 13 arrays with the geometry and operation conditions shown in Table 2 is used in the validation. Table 3 compares the total pressure drop and mass flow rate obtained from the VIPRE-01 code and the present method. Comparing the results of Table 3 shows that the external channel has a higher pressure drop due to the grid spacers, but, the internal and external channel pressure drop must be the same, so less mass flow rate is driven toward the external channel. As seen in Table 3, the results are in good agreement with a difference of less than 1%.
A comparison of the DNBR profiles calculated by the present method and VIPRE-01 code along the internal and external channels using the W-3 CHF correlation is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the results of the present methods and the VIPRE-01 code have small differences. The small differences are due to the application of different constitutive correlations, different two-phase flow models, as well as applying different thermodynamic properties of water/steam tables in each code.

5. Analysis of hot fuel assembly
In the core, due to the connection between the external channels and the transverse flow exchange, subchannel analysis of the hot fuel assembly is essential. In the following, the present method is applied to modeling the MIT 13 × 13 annular fuel assembly (Feng et al., 2007) operating at 150% power and flow rate using the parameters presented in Table 4. In this study, due to the symmetry and computational efficiency, 1/8 of the assembly is modeled. Fig. 7 illustrates the power distribution and numbering scheme of subchannels and rods in the hot fuel assembly. Summary of the design data and closure correlations used in subchannel analysis are given in Table 4 and Feng et al. (2007).
Fig. 7. Power distribution (left) and numbering scheme (right) in the hot fuel assembly with 1/8 symmetry.
The axial distribution of the pressure drop in the hot inner and outer channels is shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen in the Fig. 8, the pressure drop variations in the internal channel are uniform, but for the outer channel, there are fluctuations due to the grid spacers. Fig. 8 shows that the results of the different methods are in good agreement. However, slight differences are due to the application of different correlations to calculate the pressure drop coefficients.
Fig. 8. Comparison of pressure drop in the inner and outer channel.
Table 5 compares the total pressure drop and MDNBR results obtained by the present method, and VIPRE-01 code for the hot fuel assembly. The results are in good agreement and the difference in total pressure drop and MDNBR values obtained by different methods is less than 2% and 5%, respectively. Table 5 shows that the MDNBR on the external channels is significantly larger than the internal channels. The reason will be discussed next.
Table 5. Comparison of the MDNBR and pressure drop results.
Fig. 9 shows the comparison of the axial coolant temperature distribution in the internal and external channels. Also, Fig. 10 shows the axial distribution of the heat flux for the inner and outer surfaces of the hottest fuel rod. It can be seen that the cooling temperature in the outer channel is higher than that in the inner channel. This is due to the fact that, the hydraulic diameter of the inner channel is larger than that of the outer channel, as can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table 4, also the outer channel has a higher pressure drop due to the grid spacers, but the inner and outer channel pressure drop should be equal. Therefore, for the outer channel, the mass flow rate is lower. Furthermore, although the inner surface has a higher heat flux than the outer surface, most of the heat is transferred to the outer channel. Thus, the temperature of the outer channel is larger than that of the inner channel and reaches saturation temperature faster. The heat flux of the inner channel is 1.41 times that of the outer channel. This result is obtained when the internal and external gap conductance are equal (hgi = hgo = 6000 W/m2.K).

Fig. 10. Comparison of axial heat flux of the inner and outer channels.
Fig. 11 illustrates the axial distribution of the mass flux in the inner and outer hot channel of the fuel assembly. In the inner channels, because of their isolation, the mass flux is constant along the channel and is higher than that of the outer channel. The mass flux for the outer hot channel is reduced due to the lateral flow along the channel, and the net flow to the hot channel is outward. The net outward flow of the outer hot channel is positive, because the thermal expansion of coolant reduces the density along the hot channel (Output lateral flow density is less than that of the input lateral flow) and the pressure drop reduces the flow rate along the heated channel. Therefore, the hot channel has a higher pressure drop due to the subcooled boiling along most of the length of the hot outer channel than the other channels. On the other hand, the boundary condition of equality of total pressure drop for all channels leads to a decrease in mass flux along the hot outer channel.
Fig. 11. Distribution of axial mass flux in the hot inner and outer channels.
Fig. 12 shows the axial distribution of the void fraction versus equilibrium quality for the hot inner and outer channels of 13 × 13 annular fuel at 150% power. It is apparent that for the hot outer channel, subcooled boiling started earlier, and the void fraction of the hot outer channel is higher than that of the hot inner channel. Because more of the heat transfer is directed to the outer channel. On the other hand, the mass flux of the outer channel is lower than that of the inner channel, and the coolant temperature in the outer channel is higher than that of the inner channel. Therefore, in the upper portion of the channel, the void fraction and equilibrium quality of the outer channel is higher than that of the inner channel.

The radial temperature distribution for the four annular fuel rods in the axial position where the maximum power is generated is shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen that due to the higher heat flux and larger power peaking factor, the temperature of the annular fuel rod, No. 8, is higher than the other rods.
Fig. 13. Radial temperature distribution of some fuel rods.
Fig. 14 shows the axial distribution of the cooling temperature for four different rods. It is clear that the temperature of the outer channel is higher than the inner channel temperature due to more heat generation in the fuel pellet that is transmitted to the outer channel, and the lower mass flow of the outer channel than the inner channel.

Fig. 15 shows the axial distribution of the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) for the NO. 8 and NO. 19 annular fuel rods using W-3 correlation. In annular fuel rods, the DNBR for the outer channel is higher than that of the inner channels. Due to the inter-channel mixing occurring in the outer channels, and the lower heat flux of the outer channels (DNBR = q″CHF/q″actual) the DNBR of the outer channels is higher than that of the inner channels which is consistent with the previous results.
Fig. 15. DNBR of rod 8 and rod 19.
To illustrate the benefits of annular fuels, the MDNBR results of the inner and outer channels of the MIT 13 × 13 annular fuel assembly operating at 150% power are compared with that of the hot channel of the reference solid fuel at 100% power (Feng et al., 2007) in Fig. 16. It can be seen that the results of the different methods are in good agreement, and the annular fuel has higher MDNBR than the solid fuel for most of the core length. Only at the end of the channel, the MDNBR of the annular fuel less is than that of the solid fuel, but it remains above the 1.3 limit.
Fig. 16. Comparison of MDNBR of annular fuel and solid fuel.
Inlet and outlet temperatures and pressure of the annular fuel core are almost equal to the reference reactor, so the DNBR is mostly determined by the difference in mass flux and quality along the channels. At the lower section of the core, the cooling quality for the reference reactor and the annular fuel core are close. Therefore, the mass flux has more significant effect on the DNBR determination. The MIT 13 × 13 annular fuel core operating at 150% power also has 50% more mass flux, so its DNBR is higher. But at the upper section of the annular fuel core, as the cooling quality increases, the effect on the DNBR increases. The upper part of the annular fuel core has higher quality at 150% power, so the DNBR is reduced.
6. Conclusions
Modeling two-phase flow is a fundamental topic in terms of the safety and operation of nuclear reactors. Extensive research has been dedicated to the improvement of the current methods and models used for thermal–hydraulic simulations. In this study, a JFNK scheme with the semi-implicit PBP preconditioning was developed for the subchannel analysis of annular fuel assembly in a PWR based on the DFM. This study is the first successful application of the JFNK method with the semi-implicit PBP preconditioning for the subchannel analysis of the annular fuel assembly. The staggered grid finite volume method is used for spatial discretization, and the fully-implicit backward Euler time integration scheme is used for the temporal discretization of the governing equations.
Considerable emphasis is put on the verification of the present method by comparing the numerical results with the available data in the literature, for different arrays under different operating conditions, and reasonable agreement is observed. Differences between the computational results using different methods were also recognized and discussed. The following is the summary of the main findings:
@(1)
In the 13 × 13 annular fuel design, about 56% of the heat generated in the fuel is transferred to the outer channel and 44% to the inner channel. Therefore, the heat flux ratio of the inner wall to the outer wall is approximately 1.4.
@(2)
In the annular fuels, the mass flux of the inner channels remains constant due to the isolation and absence of the interchannel mixing. However, for outer channels, the mass flux varies along the channel due to the cross-flow (mixing effects) and the subcooled boiling along the channel.
@(3)
The inner channel has a higher mass flux than the outer channel due to the presence of the spacer grid on the outer channel.
@(4)
At the channel outlet of the 13 × 13 annular fuel operating at 150% power, the MDNBR is less than that of the reference solid fuel at 100% power. However, it remains above the 1.3 safety margin.
@(5)
A Comparison of the results showed that the JFNK method with a semi-implicit physics-based preconditioner can predict the subchannel parameters of the annular fuel assemblies with sufficient accuracy within 5%.
