Abstract
Silver-111 (111Ag, t1/2 = 7.47 d) is a β− emitter suitable for targeted cancer therapy due to favourable decay properties. The production of no-carrier added 111Ag via Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique is being investigated at the Legnaro National Laboratories of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (ISOLPHARM project). Stable Cadmium-111 (111Cd) is co-produced as isobaric contaminant, hence a chemical separation process must be developed to selectively harvest 111Ag. In this study, a chromatographic procedure employing the commercially available CL resin was investigated by using stable Ag+ and Cd2+. Results indicate that CL resin allows to efficiently separate Ag+ from Cd2+ and recover the former with high yields.

1. Introduction
In recent years, targeted radionuclide therapy has become an effective strategy for cancer treatment (Malcolm et al., 2019; Ramogida and Orvig, 2013), because it allows the delivery of ionizing radiation directly to the disease site while sparing the surrounding healthy cells. Silver-111 (111Ag, t1/2 = 7.47 d) is regarded to be promising for radiotherapy, as it emits low-energy β− particles (βmax = 1.04 MeV), and two low energy γ-radiation (Eγ = 245.4 keV, Iγ = 1.24%; Eγ = 342.1 keV, Iγ = 6.7%) suitable for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging (Mastren et al., 2018a). The current production methods for 111Ag include thermal neutron irradiation of palladium targets and deuteron-induced reactions but are not fully satisfactory (Hermanne et al., 2004; Mastren et al., 2018a), so that the Legnaro National Laboratories of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics are investigating a cyclotron-based method for the production of no-carrier-added 111Ag via Isotope Separation On-Line technique (ISOL; ISOLPHARM project) (Andrighetto et al., 2019; Borgna et al., 2018, 2017). By this method, stable cadmium-111 (111Cd) is expected as isobaric contaminant of 111Ag in the collected beam (Andrighetto et al., 2019). As any metal ions impurities may act as a competitor of 111Ag during the subsequent radiolabelling, a chemical separation process, suitable to be automatized, must be developed to remove 111Cd and selectively harvest 111Ag.
In this work, a chromatographic strategy was chosen, and the commercially available CL resin was considered as stationary phase. This resin carries an organic solution of alkyl phosphine sulphides (R3Pdouble bondS) and oxides (R3Pdouble bondO), and it was primarily designed and marketed for the separation of chloride and iodide from aqueous solutions (Mastren et al., 2018b; Zulauf et al., 2010). The CL resin was recently proposed by Mastren et al. for Ag+ recovery and preconcentration (Mastren et al., 2018a), so that it was considered herein to separate Ag+ and Cd2+. As the ISOL facility is currently not yet operating, stable Ag+ and Cd2+ solutions were used in place of 111Ag and 111Cd.
2. Materials and methods
All reagents (Sigma Aldrich, Baker, Merck) were analytical grade purity and were used without further purification. CL resin bottle (particle size 50–100 μm) and pre-packed 2 mL cartridges (particle size 100–150 μm) were provided by Triskem International and used without further processing.
The weight distribution coefficients (Dw) of Cd2+ onto the CL resin were determined using thebatch mode reported in the literature (Mastren et al., 2018a) and by analyzing the Cd2+ content in solution via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (7700x ICP-MS, Agilent Technologies International Japan, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Three trials of column separations were performed by using CL resin cartridges. The cartridges were preconditioned with a liquid phase (trials 1 and 2: 0.1 M HNO3, 5 mL; trial 3: 1 M H2SO4, 5 mL) before the introduction of the load solution containing Ag+ (AgNO3, 10 ppb) and Cd2+ (Cd(NO3)2, 5 ppb) (trials 1 and 2: 1 mL; trial 3: 5 mL). Subsequent wash (trials 1 and 2: 0.1 M HNO3, 5 mL; trial 3: 1 M H2SO4, 25 mL) and elution steps (trial 1: 10 M HNO3, 5 mL; trial 2: 7 M NH3, 5 mL; trial 3: 0.1 M thiourea, 10 mL) were performed to elute Cd2+ and Ag+, respectively. Fractions of 1 mL were collected in trials 1 and 2, whereas 1 mL, 3 mL, and 5 mL fractions were collected during the load, wash and elution steps in the third trial, respectively. Each fraction was analyzed via ICP-MS to determine the content of Ag+ and Cd2+.
3. Results and discussion
A literature survey and batch experiments were at first performed to choose suitable solvents for the wash step, which should allow to separate Ag+ from Cd2+. Mastren et al. have measured the weight distribution coefficients (Dw) of Ag+ onto CL resin and in various aqueous HNO3 solutions, showing that this metal ion was more retained in the resin by diluting HNO3 (Mastren et al., 2018a). In the present study, similar experiments were performed for Cd2+, which showed no sorption independently on HNO3 concentrations. Values of Dw for both Ag+ and Cd2+ are available in 1 M H2SO4 (Zulauf et al., 2010), suggesting that also this solvent would allow Ag+ retention and Cd2+ elution. For the subsequent elution step of Ag+, literature data (Mastren et al., 2018a) suggest that concentrated HNO3 may be a suitable solvent. In the present work, also solutions containing known Ag+ ligands, like NH3 or thiourea, were tested.
The elution profiles of the chromatographic experiments were determined by loading the CL resin with a solution containing Ag+ and Cd2+ (concentrations and volumes were chosen to resemble those expected from the ISOL beam collection (Andrighetto et al., 2019)), and by collecting several fractions of the eluting solution and analysing their Ag+ and Cd2+ content. Results from trials 1 and 3 are shown in Fig. 1 as examples. With trial 1 (Fig. 1, left), Cd2+ was quantitatively removed in the wash step (0.1 M HNO3), whereas Ag+ was retained and subsequently eluted using 10 M HNO3, giving a 90% (±5%) total recovery. NH3 was tested as Ag+ eluent in trial 2: the metal ion was not eluted with diluted NH3 (0.1 M), but it was quantitatively recovered (99%) using an increased concentration (7 M). In trial 3 (Fig. 1, right), 1 M H2SO4 was considered for the wash step, and Cd2+ was again completely removed. Furthermore, 1 M H2SO4 avoided some Ag+ loss observed with 0.1 M HNO3 in trials 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1 left, where 12% of Ag+ coeluted with Cd2+). The elution of Ag+ was then performed using 0.1 M thiourea, and a very good recovery (92%) was attained.

4. Conclusion
Our results indicate that CL resin holds promise for efficient isolation of 111Ag from 111Cd. Several solvents were tested: the best results were obtained using 1 M H2SO4 for the wash step, whereas all the considered eluents (10 M HNO3, 7 M NH3 and 0.1 M thiourea) allowed a nearly quantitative Ag+ recovery. Noticeably, the whole procedure was also fast, as it required around 15 min from the precondition start to the elution end. The suitability of the proposed method will be validated by testing these conditions with irradiated materials.
