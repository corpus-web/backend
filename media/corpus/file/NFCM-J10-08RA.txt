Abstract
47Sc radioisotope with beta particle emission can be used for targeted radionuclide therapy in nuclear medicine and can be produced by nuclear reactor (with high activities) and accelerator. In this work, the specific activity of 47Sc with the isotopic impurities produced through irradiating the enriched 47Tio2 and natural TiO2 targets have been calculated by the MCNPX-2.6 and the TALYS-1.8 codes and also theoretical approach in a fast neutron flux 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1 in the reactor. In addition, the cross sections of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reaction have been interpolated in the 1–10 MeV energy range and compared with the corresponding experimental data, as well. Moreover, the average cross sections of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc, 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc reactions were reproduced. Acceptable agreement between the experimental data and calculated results confirms the ability of the used methods to design and predict the production process in reactor.

1. Introduction
The radionuclides with beta particle emission used for targeted radionuclide therapy emit radiation with a relatively short path length which can radiate tissue volumes with multicellular dimensions and causes the destruction of damaged cells (UNSCEAR, 2000, Bakht et al., 2012). 47Sc radioisotope with a half-life of 3.35 days and beta particle emission (E max, β1 = 600 keV (32%); E max, β2 = 439 keV (68%); Eγ = 159 keV) could be an alternative to carrier added 177Lu for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) (Majkowska-pilip and Bilewicz, 2011). Scandium radionuclides can be produced by nuclear reactor and accelerator. 47Sc with high activities can be produced by fast neutron irradiation on the enriched 47TiO2 and natural TiO2 targets via 47Ti(n,p)47Sc reaction in a nuclear reactor (Mausner et al., 1998, Kolsky et al., 1998, Pietrelli et al., 1992). Other methods of producing of 47Sc were based on proton irradiation of natural Ti (Kopecky et al., 1993) or γ irradiation of 48Ti in an electron linear accelerator (Yagi and Kondo, 1977). Bartoś et al. in 2012 reported the activity of 47Sc radionuclide and isotopic impurity via irradiating of enriched and natural TiO2 targets with fast neutron flux 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1 in irradiation time 140 h in the nuclear reactor Maria at Świerk, Poland. Also, they experienced the new separation method of no-carrier-added 47Sc from titanium target (Bartoś et al., 2012). In 2016 Deilami-nezhad et al. (Deilami-nezhad et al., 2016) measured the specific activity of 47Sc radionuclide and the produced isotopic impurity (46Sc, 48Sc) by irradiation of natural TiO2 target in Tehran Research Reactor with fast neutron flux 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1 in irradiation time 4 days and the cooling time of 7 days.
In this work, the obtained products from probable reactions of TiO2 target in reactor were investigated. The specific activity (yield) of 47Sc through irradiating the enriched 47TiO2 and natural TiO2 targets via 47Ti(n,p)47Sc reaction in a fast neutron flux 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1 have been calculated by the MCNPX-2.6 and the TALYS codes and also theoretical approach. Moreover, the yields of the produced isotopic impurities were calculated using the theoretical and simulation methods. The results were compared with the experimental data of Bartoś et al. and Deilami-nezhad et al., as well. Also, the cross sections of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reaction have been interpolated in the fast neutron energy range. The average cross sections of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc, 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc reactions were estimated using the theoretical approach. Acceptable agreement between the calculated results and experimental data confirms the ability of the used methods to design and predict the production process in reactor.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Assessment methods based on the theoretical approach
In the evaluation by the theoretical approach, pay attention to probable reaction channels for target is essential. The reactions with the low occurrence probability can be ignored due to the low cross section and or the threshold energy greater than 10 MeV (because of the low neutron flux). In Table 1, the probable reactions for the TiO2 target in reactor have been summarized. Among the mentioned reactions, three reactions of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc, 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc is noticeable which can lead to the production of scandium radioisotopes. The candidate reactions have the cross sections and the production yields (specific activity) greater than the other reactions and create the major radioactive products.

Since the TiO2 target has the different abundances of isotopes 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti and 50Ti therefore, the percent abundance plays a significant role for the product specific activity (SA). The product specific activity at the irradiation time t will be counted as follows (IAEA, 2003):
@(1)
where M is the molar mass of the target, λ - the decay constant of radioisotope, H - the abundance fraction of isotopic, φ and σ are the neutron flux and the activation cross section for the production of radioisotope. Since, the scandium production reactions are via (n,p) reaction and having the significant cross section in the fast energy region (0.5–10 MeV) therefore, the neutron flux at the target site has been approximated to the fast neutron flux. The fast neutrons distribution produced in the fission process is known as the fission spectrum. One of the empirical relations to describe the fission neutron spectrum was presented by Cranberg et al. fission spectrum (normalized to 1 from 0 MeV to infinity) as follows (Cranberg et al., 1956, Omar et al., 2011):
@(2)
where E is energy in MeV. The average cross section using the cross section data and the fission spectrum is defined as follows:
@(3)
̅
where the integral is solved in 0.5–10 MeV fast region for the selected reactions. The theoretical calculations have been done in two methods. In the first method, using the average cross sections reported by Durham et al. (Durham et al., 1962), the specific activity (SA) of 46Sc, 47Sc and 48Sc radioisotopes has been calculated as direct. In the second method, the production yields of scandium radioisotopes have been calculated by using the experimental cross section data and Cranberg fission spectrum. Moreover in this method, the average cross sections have been estimated for the studied reactions.
2.2. The definition of target geometry and the simulation method by the MCNPX code
The Monte Carlo codes are widely used to simulate the reactor core because of their capability to treat complex geometries and the fact that they represent more accurately in the cross section data by using a continuous energy scale (Bakkari et al., 2009, Plaschy et al., 2009; Sunil et al., 2008; Sadeghi et al., 2013a). MCNPX is a general Monte Carlo radiation transport code that is used to track 34 particle types and more than 2000 heavy ions over broad ranges of energies. It utilizes the latest nuclear cross-section libraries and uses physics models for particle types (Sadeghi et al., 2013b, Sadeghi et al., 2012a, Sadeghi et al., 2012b, Sadeghi et al., 2009).
In other to investigate the production of 47Sc via the irradiation of natural titanium dioxide in the Tehran Research Reactor using the MCNPX code, the first step is the detailed modeling of the core including fuel rods, control rods, graphite and irradiation boxes. The reactor is the pool type with the light water and non-homogeneous and the power of 5 MW. Fig. 1 shows the reactor core which includes 28 sets of fuel packages and 14 packages of graphite. The target containing 5 mg of natural TiO2 in the irradiation-box is located inside a capsule (a quartz ampoule with dimensions 41.6 mm long, 8 mm outside diameter, 6.4 mm inner diameter that is placed within an aluminum can with dimensions 70 mm long, 24.8 mm outside diameter, 23.4 mm inner diameter). By using the f4 card, the distribution function of the flux per unit energy has been calculated according to the fission spectrum in the fast neutron energy region as follows:

Constant coefficients of a, b and c is determined by using the results of the MCNPX code.
On the other side, the cross sections of the studied reactions have been obtained by the TALYS-1.8 code (Koning et al., 2013) and have been compared with the TENDL-2014 library and experimental data.
By the energy distribution function φ(E) and the cross sections achieved from TALYS-1.8 code and TENDL-2014 database, the specific activity of radioisotopes have been calculated through applying the results of the numerical integral the following:

The calculated results have been compared with the corresponding experimental values as a benchmark data.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Theoretical calculations
In the 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reaction, the cross sections in the energy range of 1–3 MeV are not available sufficiently. Thus, as can be seen in Fig. 2(b), the polynomial function of 5th degree was fitted on the experimental cross sections. The interpolated data are in agreement with the empirical results and listed in Table 2. Collected results were used to estimate the SA of 46Sc radioisotope.

Comparison between the cross sections of the TALYS-1.8 code together with the TENDL-2015 library and the experimental values (Dashdorj et al., 2007, Dezso and Csikai, 1977, Fabry and Deworm, 1965, Fatima et al., 2002, Maidana et al., 1994, Molla et al., 1990, Nasyrov and Stsiborskii, 1968, Qaim et al., 1990, Smith and Meadows, 1975) for excitation functions of the production reactions of scandium by titanium target.

By solving Eq. (3) using the experimental cross sections (from EXFOR database and interpolated values for 46Sc) along with the Cranberg spectrum (Eq. (2)) and with substituting in Eq. (1), the SA of radioisotopes were calculated that are in good agreement with the experimental data (see Table 3, Table 4). Also, from Eq. (3), the average cross sections for 47Ti(n,p)47Sc, 46Ti(n,p)46Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc reactions were obtained and are 21 mb, 16.2 mb and 0.44 mb, respectively.
3.2. Simulation results
As can be seen in Fig. 3, the values obtained for the flux distribution of fast neutron at the irradiation site by the MCNPX code have been shown. The best fitted function was obtained based on the fission neutron spectrum (by Eq. (4)) as follows:
@(6)
Fig. 3. Fast neutron energy spectrum in reactor by the MCNPX code at the target site and the best fitted function.
The above function in the fast region results the flux of 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1. In Fig. 2, the excitation functions of 46Ti(n,p)46Sc, 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc reactions by TALYS-1.8 code have been plotted together with the experimental values and TENDL-2014 data. The SA of scandium radioisotopes were calculated by the values of TALYS code and the neutrons distribution at the target site (Eq. (6)) in Eq. (5) and substituting the results in Eq. (1). The similar work was done by the experimental cross sections and TENDL data. The achieved results based on MCNPX code in order to compare with the experimental values by Bartoś et al. and Deilami-nezhad et al. were listed in Table 3, Table 4, respectively. About 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reaction, the interpolated values were used as the experimental cross sections.
4. Discussion
As can be seen in Fig. 4, the obtained results by the simulation method are in a good agreement with the data of Bartoś et al. and Deilami-nezhad et al. The average cross sections 21 mb, 16.2 mb for 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reactions can offer a prediction closer to production yield. The calculation on the basis of the MCNPX code offers a better value than theory. The difference of calculated and experimental results can be caused by several factors such as: secondary reactions due to subsequent neutron-capture of the radioisotopes, reduction of neutron flux due to the absorption of neighboring cores, error in the laboratory values. However, the MCNPX code can be used as a tool for the production assessment in the reactor.

5. Conclusions
In this work, the specific activity of 47Sc together with the isotopic impurity (46,48Sc) through irradiating the enriched 47TiO2 and natural TiO2 targets in a fast neutron flux 3×1013 n cm−2 s−1 in the reactor were calculated via the theoretical and simulation methods. The results were achieved in a good agreement with the experimental data of Bartoś et al. and Deilami-nezhad et al. and can be used as an acceptable way to estimation of the production process in reactor. About the 46Ti(n,p)46Sc reaction, the cross sections in the 1–10 MeV energy range by fitting the polynomial function of 5th degree were interpolated which provide a better estimate of the reaction. As well as, the average cross sections of 21 mb, 16.2 mb and 0.44 mb were estimated for 47Ti(n,p)47Sc, 46Ti(n,p)46Sc and 48Ti(n,p)48Sc reactions respectively, which predict a nearly value to experiment. Thus, these methods can be used as a tool for the production assessment in the reactor.
