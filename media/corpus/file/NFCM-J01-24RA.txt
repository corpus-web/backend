Abstract
In order to immobilize high-level radioactive graphite, silicon carbide based composite materials{ (1-x) SiC· x MgAl2O4 (0.1 ≤ x≤0.4) } were fabricated by solid-state reaction at 1370 °C for 2 h in vacuum. Residual graphite and precipitated corundum were observed in the as-synthesized product, which attributed to the interface reaction of element silicon and magnesium compounds. To further understand the reasons for the presence of graphite and corundum, the effects of mole ratio of Si/C, MgAl2O4 content and non-stoichiometry of MgAl2O4 on the synthesis were investigated. To immobilize graphite better, residual graphite should be eliminated. The target product was obtained when the mole ratio of Si/C was 1.3:1, MgAl2O4 content was x = 0.2, and the mole ratio of Al to Mg in non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 was 1.7:1. In addition, the interface reaction between magnesium compounds and silicon not graphite was displayed by conducting a series of comparative experiments. The key factor for the occurrence of interface reaction is that oxygen atom is transferred from magnesium compound to SiO gas. Infrared and Raman spectrum revealed the increased disorders of graphite after being synthesized.

1. Introduction
As is known, a key factor of nuclear industry sustainable development is the proper disposal of nuclear wastes [1]. Irradiated graphite, which is produced heavily from decommissioned graphite reactors, needs to be dealt with special waste management strategy [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Moreover, high-level radioactive graphite is that of being contaminated, corroded, and radiated at a serious degree. In addition to high Wigner energy, it has a high radioactivity due to numerous long-lived radionuclides (such as 14C (half-life is 5730 years), 41Ca (103000 years), 63Ni (76000 years)) [7]. High-level radioactive graphite is urgent to be disposed properly because its hazards have become a global threat of human health. Treating methods mainly involve incineration [8,9], steam pyrolysis [10], cement fixation [11,12], ceramic solidification [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. Although incineration and steam pyrolysis can reduce the volume of wastes and avoid Wigner energy, the emissions of 14C and volatile radionuclides cannot be avoided during incineration. In addition, steam pyrolysis is mainly for surface decontamination. So far, cement fixation has not been popularized by engineering. Because the danger of long-lived radionuclides in high-level radioactive graphite can be minimized only by deep geological disposal after hundreds of millions of years. These methods excluding ceramic solidification are more suitable for the solidification of low and medium-level radioactive graphite. Due to excellent chemical and physical stability in extremely adverse condition, ceramics have been suggested as potential wasteforms for immobilizing high-level radioactive graphite [24].
A few works about ceramics solidification can be concluded: Titanium carbide (TiC), TiC matrix, silicon carbide (SiC), and SiC matrix ceramics are always candidates for immobilizing graphite [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. TiC matrix ceramics for immobilizing radioactive graphite have been studied by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) using aluminum, graphite, and titanium dioxide as raw materials. Finally, an inhomogeneous TiC-Al2O3 ceramic solidified body was acquired [7,13,15,[19], [20], [21]]. In addition, inevitable presence of residual graphite means the low curing efficiency. Carbide (CO and CO2) released, which leads to increased porosity of ceramic. In economic, high cost makes this method fit for the disposal of extremely high activity radioactive graphite [22]. The other is silicon carbide ceramic. It has attracted considerable attentions to being a promising matrix for immobilizing 14C due to its exceptional chemical stability, high-temperature mechanical properties, and radiation stability [14,16,17,23]. To immobilize 14C better, SiC ceramic has been prepared by direct reaction of silicon and graphite. However, it is too difficult for the reaction between Si and graphite without additive at low thermodynamic values [17]. In order to decrease sintering temperature and avoid volatile radionuclide pollution, mechanochemical alloying method was adopted to synthesize SiC for immobilizing 14C by Mehul A. Chavda et al [23]. In addition, boron (B), carbon (C), Al2O3, and Mg + PTFE were selected as additives to promote the sintering of SiC [17,25,26]. Based on previous improvement of SiC sintering, continuous experiments were conducted by adopting the system (Ti, Si, C) for immobilizing 14C. A magnesium plus polytetrafluoroethylene mixture was used as an activated additive as well as chemical oven to assist the synthesis of SiC by R. M. Ayral and his colleagues [14,17]. It showed that the residual graphite decreased and the volume of wasteform reduced when an abundant silicon was added to the system (Ti, Si, C). So far, all SiC ceramics only aim at immobilizing 14C, and the solidification of other long-lived nuclides (41Ca, 63Ni, 243Am) from radioactive graphite is not mentioned.
Therefore, a second phase, which can not only improve the sintering of SiC ceramic but also immobilize long-lived nuclides (41Ca, 63Ni, 243Am), needs to be proposed to obtain SiC matrix composites. Due to excellent chemical stability, high-temperature mechanical properties, and radiation stability, magnesium aluminum spinel (MgAl2O4) has been suggested as a potential wasteform [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. On one hand, MgAl2O4 is more easily sintered than SiC because high purity translucent MgAl2O4 ceramic can be prepared by hot pressed sintering at 1400 °C [32]. On the other hand, Mg atom site in MgAl2O4 can be occupied by 41Ca, 239Pu, 243Am, and 63Ni [28, [33], [34], [35]]. Therefore, long-lived nuclides (41Ca, 239Pu, 243Am, 63Ni) can be immobilized in MgAl2O4. In this paper, MgAl2O4 can play a role of improving the sintering of SiC as well as immobilizing other long-lived nuclides. SiC matrix composite materials by adding MgAl2O4 were fabricated by solid-state reaction in vacuum. To obtain a uniform SiC-MgAl2O4 composite material, the molar ratio of Si/C, MgAl2O4 content, and non-stoichiometry of MgAl2O4 were comprehensively studied using XRD. In addition, it is complemented with FTIR and Raman spectrum.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis procedure
Silicon (Si, 99.99 wt%, 2∼5 μm, Beijing Hong-yu new material Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China), graphite (C, 99.95 wt%, 8000 mesh, AR), aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) and light magnesium oxide (MgO, 98.5 wt%, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used as raw materials. (1-x) SiC·x MgAl2O4 composite materials (0.1 ≤ x≤0.4, x is MgAl2O4 content) were synthesized by solid state reaction method. To obtain magnesium aluminum spinel, the mixture of Al(OH)3 and MgO was ball-milled in ethanol for 5 h, dried at 80 °C in a drier, and then calcined at 1400 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace (heating rate was 5 °C/min before 1000 °C while heating rate was 2.5 °C/min in the range of 1000–1400 °C). Simultaneously, the mixture of Si and C was ball-milled in ethanol for 5 h, and then dried by two stages (55 °C for 12 h followed by 108 °C for 8 h) in a vacuum. Finally, the mixture of Si, C, and MgAl2O4 was ball-milled for 6 min, dried by two stages (55 °C for 12 h followed by 108 °C for 8 h) in a vacuum, and then calcined at 1370 °C for 2 h in a graphite vacuum in the range of 2.0–30 Pascal. The experimental parameters varied as follows: (a) the molar ratio of Si/C was 1.05:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, and 1.4:1 (from SC-1 to SC-5 sample); (b) MgAl2O4 content was x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4; (c) the molar ratio of Al/Mg (ν is the molar ratio of Al/Mg) in non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 was 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2.0:1, 2.1:1, 2.2:1, 2.3:1, and 2.4:1 (from SCM-9 to SCM-1 sample). To further investigate and understand the interface reaction between silicon and magnesium, additional contrast experiments were conducted, and the detailed formulas were shown in Table 1.

2.2. Analytical procedure
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of SiC matrix composite material were conducted with X'Pert PRO Roentgen diffractometer system using Cu Kα rays (λ = 1.5418 Å) with the step size of 0.03° and 2θ from 10° to 70°. The MDI Jade 6 software (Materials Data Inc., USA) using the powder diffraction files (PDF) database of the international centre for diffraction data (ICDD) was adopted to identify XRD patterns [36]. And the microstructure of synthesized product was observed using a FESEM (Ultra 55, ZEISS Company). The magnesium content of raw material and calcined product of S3 was measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF, Axios, Wavelength dispersion type) using Rh target (The analysis element ranges from 9F to 92U). And infrared absorption spectrum of samples (IR, Spectrum One autoima) was presented in the spanning range of 400–4000 cm−1. Simultaneously, laser Raman spectrum (Raman, InVia) of samples was recorded at room temperature with argon 514 nm excitation.
3. Results
As shown in Fig. 1, β-SiC (ICDD PDF No. 75–0254) and MgAl2O4 (ICDD PDF NO. 99-0098) were observed in as-synthesized products. As expected, (1-x) SiC· x MgAl2O4 (x = 0.2; ν = 2.0:1) composites have been prepared by this method. However, graphite was left and silicon was not observed when the mole ratio of Si/C was just 1:1. Without enough silicon, graphite failed to be immobilized completely in SiC ceramic. By increasing the mole ratio of Si/C from 1.05:1 to 1.4:1 corresponding to SC1 to SC5 sample, the intensity of main diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.611° of graphite tended to reduce. Therefore, graphite appeared to be immobilized better by supplementing adequate silicon. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1) showed the intensity of main peak at 2θ = 28.433° of silicon increased sharply when the molar ratio of Si/C increased to 1.4:1. Silicon was already overdosed under this given reaction condition. To immobilize graphite as much as possible and reduce the volume of wasteform, the better molar ratio of Si/C was 1.3:1 corresponding to SC4 sample.
Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the samples synthesized at a various molar ratio of Si/C: SC1 to SC5 corresponding to the value of Si/C of 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 respectively at 1370 °C for 2 h.
Furthermore, corundum (α-Al2O3, ICDD PDF NO. 99-0036) was presented in as-synthesized products. From Fig. 2, the intensity of α-Al2O3 peak increased with increased MgAl2O4 content from 0.1 to 0.4 (the molar ratio of Si/C was 1.2:1; ν = 2.0:1). So more MgAl2O4 led to more α-Al2O3. And α-Al2O3 is the decomposition product of MgAl2O4. Simultaneously, it should pay attention to increased graphite caused by the increment of MgAl2O4 content. Therefore, residual graphite is not only related with the molar ratio of Si/C (Fig. 1) but also influenced by MgAl2O4 content (Fig. 2). In addition, the intensity of β-SiC peak decreased with increased MgAl2O4 content. And the synthesis of (1-x) SiC· x MgAl2O4 was discouraged by adding excess MgAl2O4 content. Silicon peak intensity gradually reduced when x increased from 0.1 to 0.4. It is clear that silicon is reacted with MgAl2O4. At this moment, a few silicon was consumed by the reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4, which led to increased graphite. Therefore, the reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4 has a significant effect on the synthesis of the target product.

However, magnesium oxide (MgO) was not observed by XRD when α-Al2O3 precipitated from MgAl2O4. This is correlated with the segregation of MgAl2O4. Inspired by Le Chatelier's principle, the reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4 seems to be suppressed by compensating MgO. Fig. 3 showed that non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 was fabricated at various mole ratios of Al/Mg. From MA-1 to MA-9 sample, no α-Al2O3 was precipitated even when ν increased to 2.4:1. However, MgO (ICDD PDF No. 77–2364) was presented clearly when ν reduced to 1.6:1. And the main peak located at 36°–38° of MgAl2O4 was magnified and presented in Fig. 3b. The main diffraction peak shifted to high diffraction angle when ν increased from 2.0:1 to 2.4:1. And the diffraction peak shifted to low diffraction angle when ν reduced from 2.0:1 to 1.6:1. Therefore, non-stoichiometry resulted in changes of lattice parameters of MgAl2O4. From Fig. 4, SiC based composite materials were synthesized by adding non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 corresponding to Fig. 3a. The precipitation of α-Al2O3 increased when ν was from 2.0:1 to 2.4:1. On the contrary, silicon peak intensity decreased when ν was from 1.6:1 to 2.4:1. Interestingly, α-Al2O3 was not observed when the mole ratio of Al/Mg was less than 2.0:1. At this moment, the reaction between Si and MgAl2O4 can be suppressed by replenishing with magnesium (Mg or MgO). It is worth noting that an extremely slight degree of stoichiometric segregation of MgAl2O4 can eliminate corundum. Finally, the photograph (Fig. 5a) and SEM image (Fig. 5b) of target product (SCM-8) were shown in Fig. 5. The appearance of SCM-8 is gray green powder. And the aggregates consisting of nano-size SiC particles and SiC nanowires were observed in the microstructure. The presence of SiC nanowires can improve performance of SiC matrix composites [37].

4. Discussion
4.1. The reasons for the presence of graphite and corundum
The presence of β-SiC indicated the occurrence of the reaction between silicon and graphite. Residual graphite in SC1 sample can be attributed to two aspects. On one hand, the calcined temperature is close to the melting point of silicon (1410 °C), and a few silicon volatilized. This led to insufficient silicon for reacting with graphite when the mole ratio of Si/C was 1:1. On the other hand, silicon can react with MgAl2O4 due to the strong affinity for oxygen. At this moment, silicon monoxide (SiO) appeared to form because silicon combined with oxygen atom in MgAl2O4. As a result, a few silicon was consumed by MgAl2O4, leading to inadequate silicon for the synthesis of SiC. Based on the vapor-solid (VS) mechanism for the synthesis of SiC [38], reversible reaction of silicon and graphite seems to occur, described as Eq. (1). Residual graphite reduced by increasing the mole ratio of Si/C (Fig. 1), which is in line with the principle of chemical equilibrium. Because the amount of one reactant (silicon) increased, Eq. (1) can be moved in the positive direction. However, the sharp silicon peak in SC5 sample (Fig. 1) indicated that the reaction probably achieved balanced under the given reaction condition. Finally, residual graphite can be eliminated and immobilized better by adjusting the mole ratio of Si/C.

α-Al2O3 is suggested as the product of the reaction between silicon and MgAl2O4. W.T. Donlon et al considered that the precipitation of α-Al2O3 was attributed to the evaporation of MgO from the surface of the specimen, resulting in non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 [39]. Moreover, the reaction of silicon and dolomite (magnesium compounds) in high-temperature vacuum has been used for producing metallic magnesium by Pidgeon [40]. It can be inferred that magnesium gas probably produced in the reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4. Therefore, the reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4 can be represented as Eq. (2). The reduced intensity of silicon peak and increased intensity of α-Al2O3 peak (Fig. 2) suggested the positive reaction rate of Eq. (2) increased when MgAl2O4 content increased. At this moment, the insufficient silicon for Eq. (1) was attributed to the consumption of silicon in the Eq. (2), leading to the increment of residual graphite and the decrease of SiC. It indicates that the reaction represented by Eq. (2) is competing with that described by Eq. (1). The phenomenon demonstrates that excessive MgAl2O4 appears to accelerate the decomposition of MgAl2O4 into α-Al2O3 and discourage the reaction of Si and graphite.
Eq. (2) revealed that magnesium loss could accelerate the precipitation of corundum. This undesirable phenomenon can be minimized by packing the sample in MgO powder [39]. In non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 (Fig. 3a), the precipitation of MgO rather than α-Al2O3 was observed in all samples. It is related with that the solubility ability of MgO is poorer than that of α-Al2O3 in the non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 [41]. In Fig. 3b, the shift of main peak of non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 is attributed to a slight change of the lattice parameter. The shift to high diffraction angle means decreased lattice parameter when ν increases from 2.0 to 2.4. It can be suggested as that Al3+ ions may occupy A sites of tetrahedral interstices. Similarly, the shift to low diffraction angle represents increased lattice parameter when ν decreases from 2.0 to 1.6 because Mg2+ ions may occupy B sites of octahedral interstices [42]. Slight increment of the shift when ν decreased from 1.9 to 1.6 may ascribe to the precipitation of MgO. Comparing with Fig. 3a, α-Al2O3 decreased and disappeared when ν decreased from 2.4 to 1.6 in Fig. 4. It can be interpreted by Eq. (2) that the concentration of the product (magnesium) increased, the reaction moved in the negative direction.
4.2. The characteristic of interface reaction
In previous work about selecting the second phase additive, it is found that graphite can react with metal oxide to produce metal carbides. Moreover, the multi-component system is complex. So it needs to be confirmed that the interface reaction is between element silicon and magnesium. Phase components of products were shown in Table 2 corresponding to the raw materials in Table 1. In S1, S2, and S3 sample, raw material is only different in additives (such as MgAl2O4, Al(OH)3, MgO) by maintaining silicon and graphite the same. Comparing S1, S2, with S3 sample, MgO was not detected in S3 sample. It indicates that magnesium not aluminum appears to be reduced in vacuum. And α-Al2O3 only plays a role of promoting the formation of SiC [43]. Simultaneously, S4 and S5 sample are different in non-metallic raw materials ( such as silicon, graphite) by keeping MgAl2O4 the same. Compared to S5 sample, MgAl2O4 decomposed into α-Al2O3 in S4 sample. It is clearly suggested that magnesium seems to be reduced by silicon instead of graphite. This can be interpreted that the electronegativity of Si (1.90) is smaller than that of C (2.55). In addition, the appearance of minor SiC phase in S4 sample is attributed to abundant graphite vapor produced from the graphite heater at high temperature. Comparing S1 with S6 sample, α-Al2O3 was not observed in S6 sample. It is likely related to that the reducing activity of silicon is higher than that of SiC. Because SiC is the reduced product of Si in the synthesis of SiC.
Table 2. The phase composition obtained from calcining the sample in Table 1
In Fig. 6, MgO was not detected in MS-2 sample. It can be suggested that Mg may change into cordierite (Mg2Al4Si5O18) or magnesium gas [44]. Moreover, the magnesium content decreased sharply from 11.77 wt% to 0.39 wt% corresponding to from MS-1 to MS-2 sample by XRF analysis. Therefore, the possibility of the glass phase was denied and the fact of magnesium changing into magnesium gas was affirmed.

IR and Raman spectrum are considered as one of the preferred methods for investigating graphite [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. From Fig. 7, the absorption bands centered at 954.95 cm−1 and 821.96 cm−1 belong to β-SiC. And the absorption bands around 688.61 cm−1 and 522.91 cm−1 correspond to the Al-O stretching vibration of the isolated AlO4 tetrahedra [50,51]. This may be due to the main intrinsic defects within the spinel structure. It can be suggested that Al3+ ions may occupy A sites in tetrahedral lattice, which leads to the precipitation of MgO (Fig. 3) [42]. Moreover, the bands centered at 590.92 cm−1 and 452.47 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of AlO6 octahedra [50,51]. It indicates that there are no anti-site pairs where Mg2+ and Al3+ ions exchange sites when α-Al2O3 precipitated (Fig. 4) [42]. Above information was in agreement with the results presented by Table 2. In addition, the bands around 3432.92 and 1629.33 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration and bending vibration of O-H, respectively [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. And the bands centered at 2918.17, 2850.08, and 1463.67 cm−1 are attributed to antisymmetric stretching vibration, symmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration of C-H, respectively [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. The band around 1384.51 cm−1 is associated with the stretching vibration of C-O of carbonyl while the band around 1121.03 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of C-OH of alcohol. The presence of these bands suggested that graphite was oxidized into the middle-compound containing abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, epoxide [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49],52]. These oxygen-containing functional groups may make the intermolecular force between graphite and silicon intensive and promote the formation of SiC. It is noted that the signals for the carboxylic groups became stronger from S1-0 to S3 sample, which owes to the more intense oxidation of graphite [49]. It cab be inferred that graphite appeared to be oxidized by capturing the oxygen atom from MgO, resulting in the production of magnesium gas.
Fig. 7. The infrared spectrum (IR) of the samples (S1-0 are the raw materials of S1).
Raman spectrum (Fig. 8) also showed the bands around 790 cm−1 and 960 cm−1 corresponding to the transverse optical (TO) vibration mode and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon at the Г point of β-SiC, respectively [53]. The significant red shifts of 4 and 8 cm−1 for the TO and LO modes are attributed to the size confinement effect, residual stress, and surface disorder [53]. And the shift of 520 cm−1 is associated with Si-Si bond. The Raman spectra of residual graphite revealed three major peaks: D-band around 1350 cm−1, G-band around 1580 cm−1, and 2D-band around 2725 cm−1 [45]. The intensity ratio of D to G ( I(D) /I(G) ) was an index of the disordering degree of graphite [47]. And the values of I(D)/I(G) of S1-0 to S3 samples were calculated as 0.2071, 0.6986, 0.6633, and 0.6852, respectively. It is clear that the disordering degree of graphite of S1, S2, and S3 samples were more severe than that of S1-0 sample. This indicated that graphite appeared to be more unordered after calcined especially when oxides additives existed. Fig. 9 could be proposed to vividly display the involved process in the synthesis of (1-x) SiC·x MgAl2O4. As shown in Fig. 9, the oxygen of MgAl2O4 would be captured by graphite. At this time, this oxidized graphite surface structure may be attractive for silicon since oxygen has a greater affinity towards silicon than graphite. Therefore, the Si-Si bond would break easily because it combined with oxygen into silicon monoxide (SiO) [38,54]. Simultaneously, SiC appeared to produce due to the broken silicon bond. As a consequence, Mg gas released while α-Al2O3 precipitated. Therefore, the interface reaction of Si and MgAl2O4 is probably profitable for decreasing activation energy of the production of SiC. It suggests that MgAl2O4 can be a promising additive for the sintering of SiC matrix ceramics for immobilizing irradiate graphite in future.

For interface reaction, the kinetics as well as thermodynamics model need to be considered. However, to maintain the necessary vacuum for synthesis, furnace gas needs to be withdrawn with a pump. Gas products (SiO, Mg) escape the system into surroundings. At this time, this system does not belong to closed system. It seems difficult to calculate correctly using thermodynamics empirical model. In addition, the model appears reliable only when all factors are revised by introducing correction factors. Therefore, a proper simulated method needs to be proposed for this reaction in future.
5. Conclusion
SiC based composite materials { (1-x) SiC· x MgAl2O4 (0.1 ≤ x≤0.4) } for immobilizing high-level radioactive graphite were well fabricated by solid-state reaction at 1370 °C for 2 h in vacuum using silicon, graphite, Al(OH)3 and MgO as the raw materials. The mole ratio of Si/C, MgAl2O4 content, and non-stoichiometry of MgAl2O4 play a vital role in the synthesis of composite materials. In order to reduce residual graphite and promote the production of SiC, the mole ratio of Si/C was selected as 1.3:1. Further relieving the decomposition of MgAl2O4 into α-Al2O3, MgAl2O4 content is fit for 0.2 and the mole ratio of Al/Mg was 1.7:1. Slight non-stoichiometric MgAl2O4 has a significant influence on the elimination of α-Al2O3. The characteristic of interface reaction of silicon and MgAl2O4 in vacuum revealed that the addition of MgAl2O4 may make the surface structure of graphite change a little. As a result, intermediate products of graphite were produced, which decreased the activation energy of the reaction and promoted the formation of SiC. Hence, (1-x) SiC· x MgAl2O4 (0.1 ≤ x≤0.4) composite materials can be potential wasteforms for immobilizing irradiated graphite (14C) and its radioactive contaminants.
