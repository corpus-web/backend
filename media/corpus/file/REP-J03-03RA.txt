ABSTRACT
The lead element or its salts are good radiation shielding materials. However, their toxic effects are high. Due to less toxicity of bismuth salts, the radiation shielding properties of the bismuth salts have been investigated and compared to that of lead salts to establish them as a better alternative to radiation shielding material to the lead element or its salts. The transmission geometry was utilized to measure the
mass attenuation coefﬁcient (m/r) of different salts containing lead and bismuth using a high-resolution
HPGe detector and different energies (between 81 and 1333 keV) emitted from point sources of 133Ba, 57Co, 22Na, 54Mn, 137Cs, and 60Co. The experimental m/r results are compared with the theoretical values obtained through WinXCOM program. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with their
experimental ones. The radiation protection efﬁciencies, mean free paths, effective atomic numbers and electron densities for the present compounds were determined. The bismuth ﬂuoride (BiF3) is found to have maximum radiation protection efﬁciency among the selected salts. The results showed that present salts are more effective for reducing the intensity of gamma photons at low energy region.

1.Introduction
The contributions of nuclear power and nuclear technology in different areas of everyday life like the production of electricity by nuclear power stations, the world of dentistry and medicine via dental imaging and radiotherapy, food irradiation, inspection and instrumentation, desalination, sterilization, and industry have been signiﬁcantly improved.
Although nuclear technology has different applications in our life, it also has several disadvantages. One of the major disadvan- tages of the nuclear technology is the contamination caused by the radiation to the environment and to a massive area of surrounding land. Therefore, it is important to reduce the leakage of the radia- tion by using some materials that can attenuate the radiation,  which is known as shielding materials [1e5]. In this regard, different investigators developed several types of concrete which posses excellent radiation attenuation parameters [6e8]. In addi- tion, recently some researchers try to prepare different glasssystems that can be used as radiation shielding materials [9e12]. Besides, several investigators have developed polymer composites for the radiation shielding purposes [13e15].
Lead (Pb, Z 82) and its derivatives are the most common ra- diation shielding materials since they have high value of the mass attenuation coefﬁcient for gamma radiations and provide best shield against gamma radiations. Also, they have other applications in various ﬁelds such as lead salt have been widely utilized as sensors for infrared (IR) radiation, optoelectronic devices, solar cells and photo-resistors [16]. However, recently, due to the toxicity of the lead, the investigators are now focused on developing alter- natives to the lead and its derivative that can be employed for high- energy radiations such as gamma radiation.
In this context, bismuth (Bi, Z 83) is one of the less toxic heavy metals. The bismuth compounds are attractive for use indifferent applications. For example, they used as catalysts, in addition to the pharmaceuticals industry via the substitution of toxic Pb to the electronics industry [17]. Also, recently bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) is used in the preparation of different glass systems that used for radiation shielding.
Accurate values of some quantities such as mass attenuation coefﬁcient (m/r), effective atomic number (Zeff), and mean free path,

which estimate the absorption and scattering of gamma radiation with matter, are important to judge a material's practical applica- tion in radiation protection. Frequently, photon interaction is dependent on many factors like the energy of the photon, the density of the material, and the atomic number of elements present in the materials [18e20].
The main aim of the current work is to investigate the photon attenuation parameters of different lead and bismuth salts. The mass attenuation coefﬁcients (m/r) for the selected lead and bis-
muth salts have been measured experimentally using the trans- mission geometry in the energy range of 81 keVe1333 keV. Besides, the m/r values have been calculated theoretically using WinXCOM
program [21]. Furthermore, the radiation protection efﬁciencies, mean free paths, effective atomic number and electron densities of the present samples were determined.
2.Materials and method
In the present work, the transmission geometry was utilized to measure the m/r of the following compounds containing lead and bismuth: bismuth chloride oxide, bismuth bromide, bismuth ﬂuo- ride, bismuth iodide, lead sulfate, lead chloride, lead bromide and lead iodide. The various Pb and Bi salts have been purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Each sample was prepared with the help of hydraulic press by applying 15-ton press per cm2. The samples were disc shaped having 13 mm diameter and different masses. The mass per unit area values were determined as 0.504e1.067 g/cm2 for Bi salts and 0.410e0.748 g/cm2 for Pb salts. The chemical for- mula and the density of the selected samples are listed in Table 1. The experimental setup used in the experiments is given in Fig. 1. In the experiments, 81, 161, 276, 303, 356 and 384 keV from 133Ba, 122 and 136 keV from 57Co, 511 and 1275 keV from 22Na, 835 keV from
54Mn, 662 keV from 137Cs, 1173  and 1333  keV from 60Co  photon
energies were used. Besides, an HPGe detector (Ortec trademark, GEM-SP7025P4-B model) with an active crystal diameter of 70 mm and an active crystal length of 25 mm, with a resolution of 380 eV at
5.9 keV, 585 eV at 122 keV and 1.8 keV at 1.33 MeV was used in the experiments. The experimental measurements were repeated three times to determine the selected parameters. For sufﬁcient statisti- cal accuracy, the spectrum of each source (with and without absorber) was recorded for 1000 s. The detailed experimental procedure can be found in our recent paper [22]. The radiation protection efﬁciency results were determined using the initial and transmitted gamma intensities (i.e. I0 and I). The mean free path, effective atomic number and electron density results were calcu- lated with the help of the obtained mass attenuation coefﬁcients.
3.Results and discussion
The values of linear attenuation coefﬁcient (m) have been measured at several photon energies from the measured incident
and transmitted photon intensities (I0 and I) for the samples in a narrow beam geometrical setup. The experimental values of m/r
have also been obtained from the above measured values by dividing with the densities of the respective compounds. These values are enlisted in Table 2 together with the estimated uncer- tainty in experimental measurements obtained with the following formula:
@1
where, DI0 and DI are the uncertainties in the measurement of I0 and I, respectively and Drx is the uncertainty in the measurement
of mass per unit area of the sample. These uncertainties are due to the uncertainties in the measurements of the areas under the related g-ray peaks, mass per unit area of the samples and statis- tical uncertainties in the measurements of incident (I) and trans- mitted (I0) intensities. The maximum uncertainties are 4.39% in BiClO, 4.76% in BiBr3, 4.96% in BiF3, 4.64% in BiI3, 4.45% in PbSO4,
3.84% in PbCl2, 3.95% in PbBr2 and 3.96% in PbI2, respectively. The

measured m/r values are also compared with the theoretical values of mass attenuation coefﬁcients obtained through WinXCOM, and
are represented in Table 2. The maximum difference between the experimental and theoretical values of m/r is 3.79% in BiClO, 4.63% in BiBr3, 4.00% in BiF3, 4.52% in BiI3, 4.55% in PbSO4, 4.73% in PbCl2,
4.01% in PbBr2 and 4.61% in PbI2, respectively. Hence, we can conclude that the experimental ﬁndings are in good  agreement with their theoretical ones. The variation of mass attenuation co- efﬁcients as a function of energy is represented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,
respectively for the compounds containing Bi and Pb, respectively. The m/r values increases to maximum at 122 keV and thereafter decreases  exponentially  with  increasing  energy.  It  is  due  to the
dominance of the photoelectric and Compton radiation interaction process respectively in different energy regions. Similar results were also obtained by Obaid et al. [23] and Gaikwad et al. [24].
The radiation protection efﬁciency (RPE) is a very important parameter to establish the effectiveness of a shielding material. The initial and transmitted intensities (i.e I0 and I) are related to the radiation protection efﬁciency (RPE) through equation (2) [25]:@2
The radiation protection efﬁciencies for the selected compounds are obtained and summarized in Table 3. The BiF3 was found to have maximum RPE among the compounds under study. It indicates the better shielding performance of Bismuth ﬂuoride (BiF3). Also, from Table 3 it is clear that more gamma photons being transmitted as the energy increases. On the other words, the present compounds are more effective for reducing the intensity of gamma photons at

low energy. Therefore, to improve the shielding properties for the compounds under study we must increase the thickness of the sample.
The mean free path (MFP) is another parameter to compare the shielding competence of a material. If the material has a lower mean free path, it is a better shielding material [26]. The MFP is the reciprocal of m. The experimentally measured and the theoretical values of MFP are represented in Table 4 and are found to be in good agreement. The variation of the MFP as a function of energy is represented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively for the compounds containing Bi and Pb. Based on the MFP, BiClO has the lowest MFP values thus has a good shielding performance. In general, the MFP value of any sample decreases with increasing the density, and according to Table 1, BiClO has the highest density so it is expected to possess low MFP. It is found that the mean free path is low at low energies and is increasing at higher energies. Thus, the selected compounds have good shielding properties at low energies and their shielding competence  decreases  with  energy.  Generally, Figs. 4 and 5 show that the MFP increases versus the photon energy for all the compounds containing Bi and Pb. This means that more
photons can penetrate the present compounds as the energy in- creases, and the compounds under study can attenuate more gamma radiation at low photon energy.
The other parameters are the effective atomic number and effective electron density. The large values of effective atomic number and electron density are indicative of good radiation shielding properties of the material. Since the selected compounds containing Bi and Pb are composed of more than one element, it is useful to characterize the properties of the compounds in terms of equivalent elements, which is known as the effective atomic number (Zeff) [27]. The details of the Zeff calculations are available elsewhere [28,29]. The Zeff values are determined experimentally, and the experimental Zeff values along with the theoretical ones are represented in Table 5 and it is observed that they are in good agreement. The values of Zeff range from 40.231 to 78.176 for BiClO, 49.291 to 70.787 for BiBr3, 31.347 to 76.224 for BiF3, 61.630 to
68.371 for BiI3, 24.414 to 71.118  for PbSO4, 42.397 to 76.964 for
PbCl2, 53.168 to 73.072 for PbBr2 and 63.877 to 70.533 for PbI2, respectively. It is clearly seen from Table 5 that Zeff increases to maximum at 122 keV and thereafter decreases with increasing energy. It is obvious that the Zeff values for all compounds are high for the photon with low energy. The photoelectric interaction (PE) normally dominates in the lower gamma radiation energy values and for the high atomic number of the absorbing materials. The probability for the PE (known as the cross section) to occur is dependent upon Z4—5/E3.5 [30].
The Zeff is related to another parameter known as the effective electron density (Ne), which represents the number of electrons per unit mass of the interacting materials [31]. The determined experimental and theoretical values of electron density are repre- sented in Table 6 and they are in good agreement. The values of Ne range from (2.791e5.423) x1023 for BiClO, (4.110e5.903) x1023 for BiBr3, (3.312e8.054) x1023 for BiF3, (4.420e4.904) x1023 for BiI3, (3.456e10.067) x1023 for PbSO4, (3.157e5.730) x1023 for PbCl2, (3.346e4.598) x1023 for PbBr2, (3.454e3.814) x1023 for PbI2,
respectively. Table 6 revealed that the dependence of the Ne of the compounds containing Bi and Pb versus the energy is similar to that obtained for Zeff. This trend was also observed for several materials such as rocks [5], biological compounds [24], amino acids [32], plants [33], soils [34] and triazoles samples [35].

It is generally observed that there is a good agreement between experimental and theoretical data. The following conclusions were reached; the highest mass attenuation coefﬁcients, radiation protection efﬁ- ciencies, effective atomic numbers and electron densities have BiI3, BiF3, BiClO and PbSO4 salts, respectively. In addition, the lowest

According to the these results, the above-mentioned radiation shielding pa- rameters depend on the atomic number, weight fraction, and atomic weight of elements in the material and the density of ma- terial. The obtained results are undoubtedly very important for radiation physics, health physics, radiation shielding and space studies.
