Abstract
The work was devoted to study the recycling process of the unirradiated defective uranium dioxide pellets stored during 10 years. The effect of the temperature on the kinetics of the oxidation and reduction of dioxide uranium was investigated, respectively, in the range 250 °C–600°C and 300 °C–800 °C. For the oxidation process, the kinetics is low below 350 °C, and is fast at higher temperatures. The same phenomenon is observed for the reduction process, where the rate accelerates at above 500 °C and the reduction completed in shorter time. Using a laser particle size analyzer and a Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) analyzer, it was determined that the oxidation at 400 °C gives a triuranium octoxide powder with an adequate particle size (33 μm) and a specific surface area of 0.9 m2/g in reasonable time (210 min). Reducing the triuranium octoxide to uranium dioxide powder at 600 °C in pure hydrogen was completely achieved after only 16 minutes, without affecting its characteristics. To ameliorate the specific surface area, several oxidation–reduction cycles were performed on the obtained uranium dioxide powder. It is found that after five cycles, the specific surface area of uranium dioxide was improved to more than 2.5 m2/g, minimum value required to the powder sinterability.

1. Introduction
In the UO2 manufacturing process, defective UO2 pellets that do not meet fuel specifications of density, diameter and microstructure are produced. Such defective pellets are generally recycled in order to produce new UO2 pellets. A common recycling method is to oxidize them in the range of 400 °C–500 °C to make U3O8 powder which is then added to UO2 powder [1]. The mixture of UO2 and U3O8 powders can be pressed and sintered in the same way as UO2 powder. However, the fraction of the recycled U3O8 powder is generally not higher than 10wt% in the UO2 powder [2,3]. Another way of dry recovery process is that defective UO2 pellets were treated through many oxidation–reduction cycles to have a suitable UO2 powder sinterablility [4].
It is well known that UO2 oxidizes to U3O8 in the presence of air. This oxidation has been extensively studied because of its importance in the dry storage of spent fuel, recycling of the UO2 ceramic fuel and storage of UO2 powders [5–7].
Transformation from UO2 to U3O8 undergoes two different mechanisms: (1) oxygen spreads along the grain boundary oxidizing UO2 to U4O9/U3O7 with a slight volume reduction. (2) U3O8 is finally obtained through a nucleation-growth mechanism [7]. The oxidation at temperatures lower than 200 °C show an extremely slow oxidation rate of the intermediate U3O7 phase [8–10]. However, at higher temperatures (>250 °C) the oxidation to the orthorhombic U3O8 phase occur at easily measurable rate [5,7,8,11,12]. During the oxidation mechanism, the UO2 defective pellets are spontaneously pulverized due to the stress involved by the large lattice volume of the orthorhombic U3O8 phase (30% larger than the cubic UO2 phase) [7].
Several studies have also investigated the reduction kinetics of U3O8 to UO2 powder [13–20]. The reduction of U3O8 is thermodynamically favored by reductants like ammonia, hydrogen and CO. Hydrogen is widely used as an efficient reducing agent [13]. Yang et al. [14] reported that the reduction reaction occurs in the temperature range between 400 °C and 600 °C. Some authors have indicated that the reduction kinetics depends also on several other parameters: gas composition or partial pressure, and physical properties of the powder, such as Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) surface area and size [15–18]. Numerous works have been published about the recycling of defective spent fuel [21–25]. Whereas, as known to the authors, there are no studies about the recycling of unirradiated aged UO2 pellets. It is well known that ambient-air storage influences dramatically the oxidation kinetics, see reference [7] and references therein. In this work, the dry recycle route was used to recover, through numerous cycles, defective UO2 pellets stored for 10 years. Our aim is to determine the adequate oxidation and reduction conditions and the number of repeated cycle to get UO2 powder with a required specific surface area allowing its sinterability.
2. Experimental
Defective sintered UO2 pellets used in this study are taken from batches stored in ambient air for about 10 years. They were originally obtained by compacting UO2 powder and sintering green pellets in hydrogen at 1700 °C during 4 hours. These pellets (∼12 mm diameter and ∼13 mm height) have a density of 10.5 g/cm3 as measured by a water immersion method and the grain size is about 9 ± 1.5 µm determined by a linear intercept method.
Isothermal dry oxidation treatments were carried out under static air atmosphere (0.2 atm O2) in a muffle furnace (BWF11/13, carbolite) in the temperature range 250 °C to 600 °C up to 54,720 min. The relative humidity, during the experiments is lower than 20%. The isothermal reductions of U3O8 to UO2+X powder were made in 100% pure hydrogen (5N) flowing at 2.5 l/h through the drying filter in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG96, Setaram). The sample was first heated under pure argon until the desired reduction temperature. Then, maintained at this temperature for 10 min before introducing hydrogen. At the end, the cooling was achieved under argon. The stoichiometry (O/U ratios) of the UO2 pellets and the elaborated U3O8 and UO2 powders were determined using spectrophotometer UV/visible (UV/VIS 918, GBC). The properties of the prepared U3O8 and UO2 powders as a function of temperature were investigated using several techniques. The surface area of the powders was measured with a BET analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics). The phase identification was performed using X-ray diffraction (D8 diffractometer, Bruker). The gain weight was determined using an analytical balance of accuracy ±0.1 mg and the moisture content was determined by thermogravimetry (TG96, Setaram). The mean particle size of the powder was measured using a laser particle size analyzer (Mastersizer-micro, Malvern).
The textural characteristics (surface area, pore size and pore volume) of powders were determined by measuring the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K using surface area analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics). The sample was degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 24 h prior to the measurement in order to remove any residual moisture.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Oxidation kinetics
Figure 1(a) and 1(b) show the oxidation kinetics in the temperature range 250 °C–600°C. Each point on the curves was obtained in a separate experimental run, in which a pellet was oxidized at the mentioned temperature for a particular time. All reaction curves reveal sigmoidal nucleation-and-growth kinetics for the formation of U3O8 powder. The induction time and the weight gain corresponding to each temperature are reported in Table 1. The induction time is defined as the intersection of the tangent at the maximum oxidation rate with time axis of the sigmoidal reaction curve [25]. As can be seen, the kinetics observed at low temperatures (250 °C and 300 °C) (Figure 1(a)) are very low, where the induction time is about 20,010 minutes and 2880 minutes, respectively. At these temperatures, the integrity of UO2 pellets is maintained during these times as demonstrated by the photo shown in Figure 2(a) for the sample oxidized at 300 °C. Subsequently, the fragmentation of UO2 pellets starts at the sharp angles where the stress concentration is very high. Then the UO2 pellets start powdering gradually at the surface with increasing oxidation time until the complete formation of U3O8 powder (Figure 2(b)). This is achieved after oxidation times of 51,840 min and 12,240 min at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively, at which the O/U ratio is 2.67. This means that at low temperature (<300 °C), the formation of U3O8 powders requires a long time. This is due to the very slow oxygen diffusion through the U4O9/U3O7 product layer and to the slow cracking and fragmentation of the initial pellet, known as chemical fragmentation mechanism. However, at high temperature (350 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C) (see Figure 1(b)), the oxidation rate is very high. Figure 2(c) and 2(d) show an example of the pellets oxidation evolutions observed at 400 °C. One can see that the local powdering (see Figure 2(c)) starts after an induction time of 25 min (weight gain of 0.2%) and the specimen is completely powdered (see Figure 2(d)) after 180 min (weight gain of 3.7%). This explains that the bulk oxidation appears to proceed directly to U3O8 as already suggested [25–29]. A similar induction time (23 min) was reported in earlier findings [29], whereas Tucker [30] found 80 min at the same temperature. Above 500 °C (Figure 1(b)) the oxidation rate does not change significantly. Such behavior may be attributed to the plasticity increase of U3O8. The formed U3O8 does not readily spall from the UO2 surface but instead forms a barrier to retard further oxidation [27,29,31]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the recycled U3O8 powders obtained by oxidizing the UO2 pellets at 350 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C. The spectra reveal that all the identified peaks correspond to U3O8 phase according to the JCPDS Card N° 00-047-1493. The intensity of the peaks increase and the peaks width decrease with the increasing oxidation temperature of the UO2 pellets. This implies that the crystallite size of the U3O8 powder increases with the increasing oxidation temperature. The mean crystallite size deduced from the Scherrer formula (Equation 1) is about 57.2 and 123.2 nm at 350 °C and 500 °C, respectively.

The particle size distributions, using laser-diffraction-size analyzer, of the U3O8 powders obtained at different oxidation temperatures are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, the particle size increases with the increase in temperature. This is most likely due to the agglomeration effects at high temperatures as reported in the literature [27,29,31], and a possible increasing of U3O8 plasticity [27]. However, the small particle observed at 350 °C may be attributed to the presence of internal stresses, which promotes the pulverization of the UO2 pellet into fine U3O8 powder [12]. By raising the temperature, the stress involved in the oxidation is so relieved that cracks are less developed in a pellet and the particle size of U3O8 powder increases [19]. The BET surface area of the obtained U3O8 powder decreases linearly with the increasing oxidation temperature (Figure 5) indicating that the particle size increases in accordance with the laser granulometric measurements.

The N2 gas adsorption/desorption isotherm for the U3O8 powder at 77 K are shown in Figure 6 for 350 °C and 500 °C. The isotherm curves can be classified as Type V (20 < d < 500 Å) in accordance with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification [32]. The isotherms system has the characteristic type IV shape indicating that they are mesoporous materials. At 350 °C, the hysteresis is relatively large and the fraction of mesopores is important while at 500 °C the isotherm exhibits very small hysteresis, indicating the presence of only few mesopores. The pore volume distributions expressed according to the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model are presented in Figure 7 for 350 °C and 500 °C. The BJH pore diameters and pore volumes confirmed that U3O8 obtained at 350 °C was a porous material, which explained its relatively high surface area in agreement with the earlier findings [12,33].

For the oxidation and reduction cycles, the choice of the conditions for recycling of defective UO2 pellets is very important. According to the above results, the adequate surface areas (about 1 m2/g) is obtained at oxidation temperature of 350 °C and 400 °C. Nevertheless, at 350 °C or lower temperatures, the total U3O8 formation requires very long time (18 h). While it takes only 210 min at 400 °C. Thus, for the rest of this work, the oxidation temperature at 400 °C was adopted. The U3O8 powder obtained using the latter condition was reduced by pure hydrogen under isothermal treatment during 30 min.
3.2. Reduction kinetics
Figure 8 shows the kinetic curves for the reduction of U3O8 obtained in pure hydrogen at 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C. It can be seen that the process of U3O8 reduction begins between 300 °C and 400 °C but is not completed even after 240 min. This agrees with the results of Sidorov and Sofronov [20]. At 500 °C and beyond, the reduction rate increases significantly and the reaction is completed in less than 154 min. Le Page and Fane [15] found that the U3O8 was reduced to the UO2 phase in the temperature range 500 °C–600 °C in hydrogen in less than 60 min.
Figure 8. Curves of weight loss vs. time in isothermal reduction condition (T = 300 °C–800 °C), in pure H2.
At 600 °C, the complete transformation to UO2+X is achieved after 16 min. This is in agreement with Aronson and Clayton results [34] where they found that the full conversion to UO2 takes only 15 min at 575 °C.
The analysis of the UO2+X powder obtained at 600 °C shows an O/U atomic ratio of 2.10 and a specific surface of 0.8 m2/g. Such surface area value is not suitable for sintering. Thus, in order to improve the specific surface area of the produced UO2.1 powder, an alternating oxidation–reduction cycle is needed. For this purpose, we suggest the following oxidation–reduction conditions: oxidation of UO2 at 400 °C for 4 hours, and then reduction of the produced U3O8 powder at 600 °C for 30 minutes. Five cycles have been performed and the specific surface area of the obtained UO2 powder was measured after each cycle. The results are presented in Figure 9. It can be seen that the specific surface area increases with the repetition of the oxidation–reduction cycle. It increases to 2.5 m2/g after five cycles; a minimum value required for UO2 powder sinterability according to Costa [35].
