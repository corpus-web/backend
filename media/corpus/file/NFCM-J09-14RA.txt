Summary
The discovery of new eutectic phase change materials (PCMs) will overcome the current PCM challenges such as nonbiodegradability, super-cooling, and limited thermal stability. This paper reports on the development of new bio-based PCMs composed of binary mixtures of fatty acid esters and fatty alcohols at their eutectic compositions, which provide potential solid-liquid PCMs for building applications. Six binary systems, namely 1-dodecanol (DD) + methyl stearate (MES), DD + methyl palmitate (MEP), DD + methyl laurate (MEL), 1-tetradecanol (TD) + MES, TD + MEP, and TD + MEL were prepared and their thermal behaviours were deliberated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), long-term thermal stability test, and mass loss analysis. Amongst the studied systems, phase change transition temperature and latent heat of fusion of the eutectic mixtures of DD-MES, DD-MEP, TD-MES, and TD-MEP were found to be suitable for the building application with values of 22.46°C/201.91 J/g, 20.34°C/224.45 J/g, 32.05°C/209.38 J/g, and 26.72°C/210.15 J/g, respectively. The average degree of super-cooling for all PCMs was below 2°C, and no significant changes in thermophysical properties of the developed PCMs were observed after 1000 thermal cycles.
1 INTRODUCTION
Phase change materials (PCMs) integrated in building walls can enhance the thermal mass of lightweight buildings and thus contributes to reducing indoor temperature fluctuation, lessening heating and cooling loads, and lowering energy consumption. Therefore, this is an effective way to use solar energy and improve energy efficiency of buildings.1 A proper PCM for building applications should meet a number of criteria related to the desired thermophysical, kinetic, and chemical properties as well as economics. A PCM impregnated into building walls must have a high latent heat and high thermal conductivity.2, 3 They should also have a melting temperature slightly above 20°C to meet the need of thermal comfort of the building. According to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the recommended comfort room temperature is 21.0°C to 23.0°C in winter and 23.5°C to 25.5°C in summer. Besides, the PCM must have minimum super-cooling and must have sufficient crystallization rate to form crystals when the heat energy is released. The PCM must have a long lifetime, be compatible with building materials, noncorrosive, nontoxic, and show no degradation after numerous cycles.2, 3
Solid-liquid PCMs are preferred due to their capability of storing and releasing large amounts of heat within a narrow range of temperature. Solid-liquid PCMs used in buildings can be classified into three major groups: inorganic compounds, organic compounds, and eutectics of inorganic and/or organic compounds.4
Metal salts and hydrated salts are examples of inorganic PCMs while organic PCMs include paraffin and nonparaffin compounds. Inorganic PCMs are inexpensive compared with organic PCMs, nonflammable, and having high thermal conductivity and latent heat of fusion. The main disadvantages of the inorganic PCMs are super-cooling and phase segregation.5 The super-cooling and phase segregation of inorganic PCMs could be improved by adding nucleating and thickening agents; however, these agents decrease their latent heat significantly.6, 7 Paraffin is the common name of alkane hydrocarbons and their general formula is CnH2n+2. The latent heat of paraffin depends on its (CH3)–chain length, which is capable of releasing a large amount of latent heat.8 Besides the drawbacks of paraffin PCMs (eg, low thermal conductivity, flammability), paraffin PCMs are derivable from crude oils.9 Fatty acids and their derivatives (eg, fatty acid esters and fatty alcohols) lie under nonparaffin PCMs. They have some advantages over inorganic PCMs such as high chemical stability and being nontoxic. In comparison with paraffin PCMs, the nonparaffin PCMs are less flammable and also they are readily biodegradable. The nonparaffin PCMs can be manufactured from bio-sourced feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats (eg, lard, beef tallow, palm, coconut, and soybean).10 Hence, nonparaffin PCMs can be considered as a suitable substitute for paraffin PCMs.5
A eutectic PCM could be a mixture of different constituents including organic-organic, organic-inorganic, and inorganic-inorganic which has specifically designed properties such as melting point and latent heat of fusion.11 Therefore, there is no limit to the number of eutectic PCMs that can be synthesized from available organic and inorganic chemicals. The phase transition temperature and latent heat of fatty acids can be tuned through the formation of eutectic mixtures of fatty acids.11-13 Amongst eutectic compositions, organic-organic mixtures have some advantages over inorganic-inorganic and inorganic-organic mixtures. The principal advantages are high phase change enthalpy, long-term stability, and ease of impregnating into porous solid support due to their high surface tension and good chemical compatibility.14 Organic-organic eutectic PCMs can be made from mixtures of paraffin-paraffin,15-18 paraffin-fatty acid,19-22 fatty acid–fatty acid,23-26 fatty acid-fatty alcohol,27-30 and fatty acid ester-fatty acid ester.31-35
Generally, suitable PCMs for building applications must have specific thermal properties such as having a melting point in the range of the human comfort zone (20°C-25°C) and a high latent heat of fusion. Although a large number of eutectic PCMs have been widely investigated as solid-liquid PCMs and suggested for building application due to their desired melting temperatures, the latent heat of reported eutectic PCMs was almost within the scope of 100 to 180 kJ/kg. Hence, the discovery and characterization of new eutectic PCMs with high latent heat and thermal stability will overcome the current challenge thereby enabling a path forward for their widespread implementation, particularly in buildings. One of the possible eutectic PCMs with an excellent latent heat is a binary mixture of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported studies on these binary mixtures. Therefore, this study aims to introduce new binary mixtures of fatty alcohols (ie, 1-dodecanol [DD] and 1-tetradecanol [TD]) and fatty acid esters (ie, methyl laurate, methyl palmitate, and methyl stearate) as bio-based PCMs for building application.
This study has two main objectives: the first one is the determination of eutectic ratio for six binary mixtures of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters and the second is the investigation of their thermophysical properties as solid-liquid PCMs.

2.2 Preparation of bio-based binary mixtures PCMs
Six binary mixtures, DD-MEL, DD-MEP, DD-MES, TD-MEL, TD-MEP, and TD-MES were prepared in different mole fractions of the fatty acid ester (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). The binary mixtures were prepared by weighing each pure compound using an analytical balance with a precision of ±0.002 mg. The amounts weighed were placed in a glass tube and heated above the highest melting point of the pure components on a hot plate in atmospheric pressure with constant stirring (400-500 rpm). The mixtures were stirred for 1 hour to achieve homogeneity.
2.3 Characterization of new bio-based binary mixtures PCMs
2.3.1 Differential scanning calorimetry analysis
Phase change properties of the prepared bio-based binary mixtures and the pure constituents (such as melting/solidification temperatures and phase change enthalpies) were determined using a Shimadzu DSC-60 differential scanning calorimeter. The measurements were performed by varying the temperature from 0°C to 40°C with a heating rate of 1°C/min. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are performed under a dry air environment with a volume flow rate of 100 ml/min. Each sample was analysed three times and the average was taken. Before conducting the DSC analysis, the samples are heated up to 60°C to 70°C to make sure they are totally melted and deposited at the bottom of the pans. Tetradecane and octadecane were used to calibrate the DSC instrument, which allowed latent heat to be measured with uncertainty better than ±2 J/g. The uncertainty in melting temperature measurements was found to be ±0.1°C.
2.3.2 Long-term thermal stability test
For practical application, PCMs are required to work for many melting and freezing cycles without any significant changes in their thermophysical properties. Accelerated thermal cycling experiments of new PCMs were accomplished in a controlled heating/cooling water bath at temperatures cycling between 4°C and 40°C. These experiments were conducted by using 10 g of PCM in a 20-ml sealed cylindrical glass container with K-type thermocouple immersed in the centre of the PCM and connected to a data logger and PC to measure the PCM temperature during cycling. The heating/cooling cycle is composed of four steps: (a) temperature stabilization at 40°C for 30 minutes, (b) slow cooling at 0.2°C/min to 4°C, (c) temperature stabilization at 4°C for 30 minutes, and (d) slow heating at 0.45°C/min to 40°C. Following this accelerated thermal cycling (1000 cycles), DSC measurements were performed on the new PCMs to observe any changes in its thermophysical properties.
2.3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis
The thermal stability against degradation of the new binary mixtures PCMs was analysed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (SHIMADZU TGA-50). Analyses were performed by raising the temperature from room temperature to 300°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min under argon environment. The weight of prepared samples for TGA analysis was in the range of 9 to 12 mg, and they were placed on an open alumina pan. All the samples were analysed in triplicates to ascertain the measurement reliability.
2.3.4 Mass loss
To simulate real-life applications of PCMs in buildings, a simple mass loss analysis was conducted. This test was done by placing a known mass of each PCM into an aluminium pan and then loaded onto a tray in a drying oven at 50°C. The samples were removed from the drying oven and weighed every 24 hours for a period of 9 days. The percentage of mass loss was calculated using the following equation:

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this work, six bio-based binary systems were prepared and studied: (a) DD-MES, (b) DD-MEP, (c) DD-MEL, (d) TD-MES, (e) TD-MEP, and (f) TD-MEL. Phase transition temperatures, latent heat of fusion, and thermal stability of new designed alcohol-ester–based binary mixtures PCMs were measured using DSC, TGA, accelerated thermal cycling test, and mass loss analysis.

One or two endothermic peaks were observed in all prepared alcohol-ester–based binary mixtures (Tables 2, 3, and 4). In all mole fractions of MES, two endothermic peaks were observable except for the mole fraction of MES at 0.10. However, two endothermic peaks were observed in all mole fractions of MEP except for mole fractions of MEP at 0.20 and 0.30. In both systems, the first endothermic peak occurred in the temperature range lower than the melting temperature of both constituents, while the second endothermic peak appeared in the temperature range between the melting temperatures of both constituents. Two endothermic peaks appeared due to the weak intermolecular interactions between the two components. In other words, the strength of intermolecular forces between the components is weak, whereas intermolecular interaction at the eutectic mixture is in the maximum point and a single endothermic peak can be observed in the DSC melting curve. Figure 1 shows the phase transition temperatures and heat storage capacities of the DD-MES and DD-MEP at their eutectic points. The melting temperatures of 22.46°C and 20.34°C were found to be the eutectic points for DD-MES at 0.1 mole fraction of MES and DD-MEP at 0.3 mole fraction of MEP, respectively. The latent heat of fusion at the eutectic point of DD-MES and DD-MEP binary mixture was 201.91 and 224.45 J/g respectively. The eutectic mixtures of DD-MES and DD-MEP systems are considered as suitable PCMs for the building application.

Binary mixtures of DD-MEL were prepared at different mole fraction of MEL (Table 4). The binary mixture with MEL mole fraction in the range of 0.70 to 0.90 has just one endothermic peak. The melting temperature of the eutectic point was found to be 3.97°C at 0.70 mole fraction of MEL with the latent heat of melting 177.44 J/g. DSC melting curve of the eutectic mixture at 0.70 mole fraction of MEL is presented in Figure 2. The eutectic mixture of DD-MEL can be considered as a proper PCM for cold storage applications such as on farm cooling of milk and for air-conditioning (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC]) systems.

3.2 Binary mixtures of TD and fatty acid ester
Pure single component of MES, MEP, and MEL were mixed with TD at different mole fractions (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) to form TD-MES, TD-MEP, and TD-MEL binary mixtures. The thermal properties of binary mixtures were determined by DSC and the results are reported in Tables 5, 6, and 7.

Intermolecular forces between MES and TD at MES mole fractions of 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 were higher than the other mixtures which led to the formation of one endothermic peak. The eutectic point of the TD-MES binary mixture appeared at 0.30 mole fraction of MES. The peak melting temperature of this eutectic mixture is 32.05°C with the latent heat of melting of 209.38 J/g as shown in Figure 3. However, the eutectic point of the TD-MEP binary mixture occurred at MEP mole fraction of 0.60 with peak melting temperature and latent heat of melting of 26.72°C and 210.15 J/g, respectively (Figure 3). DSC results of the TD-MEL binary mixtures listed in Table 7 reveal that two endothermic peaks for all mixtures were obtained. There is no eutectic point for this binary system. A weak intermolecular interaction between MEL and TD leads the observation of two separate endothermic peaks. Therefore, each component melts and crystallizes separately, which can cause phase separation.

Phase diagrams of all studied binary mixtures were presented in Supporting Information (Figures S1 to S6). In addition, to validate the reliability and accuracy of obtained eutectic points for all binary mixtures in this study, a thermodynamic model, Wilson model, was employed to estimate the eutectic point of each binary mixture.36 The methodology of eutectic point prediction by Wilson model is given in Supporting Information, and the predicted results by the thermodynamic model were in very good agreement with the measured eutectic points.
3.3 Thermophysical characterizations of selected eutectic binary mixtures PCMs
Table 8 summarized the selected eutectic binary mixtures and their abbreviations, mole fractions, and thermophysical proprieties. The selected binary mixtures at their eutectic points provide melting temperatures in the range of the human comfort temperature, so they can be considered as suitable PCMs for building applications. In addition, DSC thermograms (melting and crystallization curves) of PCM18, PCM21, PCM23, and PCM30 were provided in Supporting Information (Figures S7 to S10). For all selected alcohol-ester–based PCMs, only one endothermic/exothermic peak can be observed, which are sharp and well-defined and indicating a successful preparation of eutectic mixtures.

3.3.1 Long-term thermal stability test
Long-term life of the PCM and the number of cycles they can withstand without any significant changes in their thermophysical properties such as latent heat, phase transition temperatures, and the super-cooling are the key parameters that will decide the market adoption of PCMs for use in the building. The stability of the developed alcohol-ester–based PCMs in terms of phase change transition temperatures against long-term thermal cycling test is presented in Figure 4. The results reveal insignificant changes in the phase change temperature of the selected PCMs during 1000 thermal cycles.
Figure 4
Phase change temperature of the selected alcohol-ester based phase change materials (PCMs) at different number of cycles
Figure 5 shows DSC melting curves of the selected alcohol-ester–based PCMs (PCM18, PCM21, PCM23, and PCM30) following first and 1000 thermal cycles. The DSC results revealed a minor change between 1% and 2% in the phase transition temperatures after 1000 thermal cycles for all samples. These changes are small and acceptable. However, slight changes in latent heats were observed. These changes could be due to an error in the sample weight used for DSC sample preparation.
Figure 5

Figure 6A,B shows thermal energy storage and release performance of the selected alcohol-ester–based PCMs for the first thermal cycle and 1000 thermal cycles. No significant changes were observed in phase transition temperatures of the PCM following 1000 cycles. By comparing the obtained phase change temperatures from the DSC and thermal cycling, it can be comprehended that the detected phase change temperatures based on thermal cycling method were lower than the peak melting temperatures obtained from DSC. The heating rate in the DSC analysis (1°C/min) was higher than the thermal cycling heating rate (0.45°C/min) which led to the formation of a gap between the phase transition temperatures obtained by using these two methods. However, obtained phase transition temperatures via the thermal cycling method were similar to onset melting temperatures of DSC results.

The super-cooling is a state where liquids solidify below their normal freezing point. The PCM must have low super-cooling, otherwise it cannot be used in any latent heat applications. Figure 6 indicates the degree of super-cooling of the developed new alcohol-ester–based PCMs at first and following 1000 thermal cycles. The average degree of super-cooling for PCM18, PCM21, PCM23, and PCM30 was 1.55°C, 1.43°C, 1.86°C, and 1.09°C, respectively. The average degree of super-cooling for each PCM was below 2°C, which is considered small and acceptable for application of PCMs. Table 9 summarized the degree of super-cooling of the selected alcohol-ester–based PCMs through 1000 cycles.

3.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermal stability of the developed alcohol-ester–based PCMs was tested by TGA. The measurements were performed by varying the temperature from room temperature to 300°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. The onset and decomposition temperatures of the developed alcohol-ester–based PCMs were determined and listed in Table 10. The thermal stability of the new alcohol-ester–based PCMs were compared with commercial PCMs: PureTemp 20 (Tp, melting = 20°C and ΔH = 171 J/g) and PureTemp 24 (Tp, melting = 24°C and ΔH = 184 J/g). Figure 7 shows the TGA curves of the PCM18, PCM21, PCM23, and commercial PCMs. It can be observed that all PCMs samples decomposed in one step, which proves the uniformity of these PCMs; however, commercial PCMs provide higher thermal stability than new alcohol-ester–based PCMs. This is due to the other additives which have been added to these PCMs such as fire retardants and thickening agents. These additives enhanced the PCM thermal stability but on the expense of heat storage capacity. TGA results also revealed that the new PCMs cannot be used in applications that require temperature above 100°C because degradation will occur. However, the thermal stability of PCM18, PCM21, and PCM23 may be suitable for building applications. The developed alcohol-ester–based PCMs provided higher latent heat of melting in compared with commercial PCMs. Furthermore, they have some advantages over paraffin-based PCMs such as being noncorrosive, nontoxic, and less flammable.

3.3.3 Mass loss
Mass loss measurements were performed by placing the four selected PCMs at 50°C in an oven over a period of time. The mass of each PCM was measured every 24 hours for a period of 9 days. Figure 8 revealed that the percentage mass loss of PCM 18 and PCM 21 follow the same trend and the same manner of mass loss can be seen from PCM 23 and PCM 30. This similarity in mass loss could result from the type of fatty alcohols that exist in PCM 18 and PCM 21 (DD), and PCM 23 and PCM 30 (TD). PCM 18 and PCM 21 lost approximately 52 wt.% from their initial masses; however, PCM 23 and PCM 30 lost only 10 wt.%. This is due to the different vapour pressure of fatty alcohols-based PCMs. The developed alcohol-ester–based PCMs are heat-sensitive, and they have the tendency to alter their fatty alcohol content, which leads to change the thermophysical proprieties. Hence, similar to any PCM, these new alcohol-ester–based PCMs must be encapsulated before incorporating into building materials to avoid PCM evaporation and leaking when it is melted. Encapsulation process should be performed at a temperature lower than the onset degradation temperature of the developed PCMs. With the advances made over the last few decades in the fields of PCM microencapsulation, it is now possible to control this adverse property to a large extent. Adding thickening agents to increase the viscosity and reinforce the molecular binding of PCMs which leads to prevention of huge mass loss is another option. However, the heat storage capacity of the PCM will decrease depending on the adding amount of thinking agent.

4 CONCLUSION
In this study, six binary mixtures of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters were prepared and their thermal behaviours were studied. DSC results revealed that the eutectic point of DD-MEL, DD-MEP, DD-MES, TD-MEP, and TD-MES binary mixtures occurred at methyl ester mole fractions of 0.70, 0.30, 0.10, 0.60, and 0.30, respectively. No eutectic point was observed for the TD-MEL binary system. Phase change transition temperature/latent heat of fusion of eutectic mixtures of DD-MEL, DD-MEP, DD-MES, TD-MEP, and TD-MES were found to be 3.97°C/177.44 J/g, 20.34°C/224.45 J/g, 22.46°C/201.91 J/g, 26.72°C/210.15 J/g, and 32.05°C/209.38 J/g, respectively. Long-term thermal cycling test showed a minimum change in the phase change temperatures of new alcohol-ester–based PCMs following 1000 thermal cycles. In addition, the average degree of super-cooling for PCM18, PCM21, PCM23 and PCM30 was found to be 1.55°C, 1.43°C, 1.86°C, and 1.09°C, respectively. The TGA results indicated that all new alcohol-ester–based PCMs decomposed in one step, which proves the uniformity of these PCMs, but commercial PCMs provide higher thermal stability than the new PCMs. Current findings of this study indicate that the eutectic mixtures of methyl esters (MEP and MES) with fatty alcohols (DD and TD) are potential PCMs for building applications due to their desirable thermal properties.
