Abstract
161Tb, which emits low-energy β−- and γ-particles in addition to conversion and Auger electrons, has aroused increased interest for medical imaging and therapy. To support the use of this radionuclide, a161Tb solution was standardised using the β-γ coincidence technique, as well as the TDCR method. The solution had 4.5·10−3% of 160Tb impurities. Primary coincidence measurements, with plastic or liquid scintillators for beta detection, were carried out using both analogue and digital electronics. TDCR measurements using defocusing, grey filtering and quenching for varying the efficiency were also made. Monte Carlo calculations were used to compute the detection efficiency. The coincidence measurements with analogue electronics and the TDCR show a good consistency, and are compatible with the digital coincidence results within uncertainties. An ampoule of this solution was submitted to the BIPM as a contribution to the international reference system.

1. Introduction
161 Tb decays to the ground and excited states of 161Dy via nine β branches, with endpoint energies ranging between 43 and 593 keV (Reich, 2011). Its decay scheme is shown in (Durán et al., 2020bb). 161Tb emits a considerable number of conversion and Auger electrons per decay, typically about ten times more than those emitted in 177Lu decay for example, which gives it a high radiotherapeutic efficiency (Champion et al., 2016). Its most intense γ-ray emissions, which are below 75-keV energy, can be used for SPECT imaging (Müller et al., 2012, 2014). All these features make 161Tb attractive for targeted radionuclide therapy (Hindié et al., 2016; Lehenberger et al., 2011).
As an initial step towards standardising the activity of 161Tb, we recently re-measured its half-life using the decay method with two ionisation chambers and a CeBr3 gamma spectrometer (Durán et al., 2020b). We determined a value of 6.953 (2) days in which the uncertainty was significantly improved while remaining compatible with both the power moderated weighted mean of all earlier measurements (Reich, 2011) and the Nucleide-LARA and ENSDF reference value (Nucléide-LARA, 2011, and NNDC).
In this work, we report the first activity standardisation of 161Tb by IRA-METAS, the designated national metrology institute in Switzerland. The primary standard was realized by β-γ coincidence counting, involving liquid and plastic scintillation for beta detection, using both analogue and digital electronics. Back-up measurements with the liquid scintillation triple to double coincidence ratio (TDCR) technique and integral gamma counting with Monte Carlo computed efficiencies were also carried out. This standardisation was taxing, due to the rather dense low-intensity low-energy gamma spectrum of 161Tb and its strong electron conversion contribution that introduces marked nonlinearities in the efficiency extrapolation. When estimating the Monte Carlo detection efficiencies for the gamma integral counting method, significant discrepancies questioned the accuracy of the published γ-ray emission probabilities. The solution and activity standardisation were, therefore, used to measure them again; this work will be published elsewhere.
161Tb's half-life is fairly long for nuclear medicine applications and, thus, smoothens the shipping of standards to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris. Aliquots of the standardised solution were sent to the BIPM as part of a contribution to the Système International de Référence.
2. Material and methods
The measurements described below were performed in two sequences.
2.1. 161Tb solution and dilutions
161Tb was produced at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) as described in (Gracheva et al., 2019). A 1 mL aliquot of product was provided in an Eppendorf vial, with a nominal activity of 390 MBq on the date of receipt. The solution consisted of 0.1 mol L−1 HCl solvent with a Tb3+-ion concentration of 25 μg g−1. The density of the solution was 1.000 (6) g cm−3.
This solution was diluted by a factor of about 26 to prepare a master solution (M161Tb3). Two 3 g aliquots were dispensed into 5 mL IER (Institut d’Électrochimie et de Radiochimie) ampoules for activity measurements in our reference ionisation chamber (CIR). Two BIPM ampoules were each filled with 3.6 mL of this solution, one of which was sent to the BIPM in Paris after both were measured in our CIR. Two 5 g aliquots were also allotted for two penicillin vials for radionuclide calibrator measurements.
A 1.7 g aliquot of the master solution was diluted by a factor of about 9.4 to prepare the M161Tb4 solution. The latter was dispensed into two IER ampoules (3 mL each), in order to check the dilution factor at the CIR, and into three Wheaton vials reserved for sample preparation for primary standardisation.
The gravimetric dilution factor was first confirmed by ionisation chamber measurements, and later by primary measurements.
2.2. Sources
2.2.1. Liquid scintillation sources
To perform 4πβ(LS)-γ coincidence measurements, aliquots of the diluted M161Tb4 solution were dispensed gravimetrically into two sandblasted glass vials using a pycnometer weighed with a Mettler balance traceable to a primary mass standard. These 20 mL low-potassium high-performance borosilicate vials were prefilled with 14.5 mL Ultima Gold cocktail, and topped up with variable volumes of ultrapure water to achieve a 6.5% aqueous fraction, which was found to be necessary for the stability of samples over extended periods (Nedjadi et al., 2016). After each sample was prepared, the vial was agitated for 2 min with a vortex shaker, and then centrifuged at 15 revolutions per second for 150 s to settle down the liquid on the cap and walls. A compositionally-matched blank was also prepared for background subtractions.
With regard to using the M161Tb4 solution for TDCR measurements, twelve liquid scintillation sources were prepared using the same process. Aliquots of carbon tetrachloride were added incrementally to nine of these samples to alter the detection efficiency by chemical quenching. Background blanks with identical composition and aqueous fraction were also prepared.
After three and half weeks of standardising this diluted solution, the M161Tb3 solution had decayed enough to enable the preparation of sources with reasonable count rates. Aliquots taken from it were used to produce a set of three sources and one of twelve sources, for coincidence and TDCR measurements respectively, using the same procedures described above.
2.2.2. Plastic scintillation sources
A pycnometer with approximately 2 g of the diluted M161Tb4 solution served to deposit weighed drops (~ 43 and 90 mg) of 161Tb onto two plastic scintillators – which had been ultrasonically cleaned beforehand – for 4πβ(PS)-γ coincidence measurements. We used UPS-923 A plastic scintillators machined into two pieces which fit together to form a 25 mm height and 25 mm diameter cylinder, inside which there is a centred cylindrical cavity (3 mm × 12 mm) housing the radioactive deposit. Drops of Ludox colloidal silica (Sigma-Aldrich GmbH, Germany) with a concentration of 0.03% wt were subsequently added to the depositions for homogenising the crystallisation process when drying. After drying, the top and bottom plastic pieces were glued together with optical grease such that the pieces could be recovered once the Terbium decayed away.
Similarly, two plastic scintillator sources from the master solution were prepared with the exception that Ludox was not used to check the extent of its effect on the efficiency.
2.2.3. Gamma spectrometry and integral counting sources
Aliquots of the diluted M161Tb4 solution were used to prepare nine sources in three geometries for integral gamma counting. Three sources were gravimetric depositions onto disk-shaped Mylar films, each supported by a stainless steel ring (‘disk’ geometry). The rest were depositions into three 15 mL Ultima Gold-filled glass scintillation vials (gsv) and into three 20 mL carrier-filled polyethylene vials (pev). Two extra sources in the latter geometry were prepared for HPGe gamma spectrometry.
For the master solutions, only two sources were prepared for corroborating the HPGe measurements.
2.3. Methods
2.3.1. 4πβ(LS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting
The detection in the beta-channel is performed using an optical chamber, made with a fluoropolymer with a high diffuse reflectance, which houses two facing 2″ photomultiplier tubes. Only one photomultiplier tube (PMT), the one with the lowest background noise and best signal/noise ratio, was used. The beta detection efficiency was varied by electronic discrimination (and optical filtering for one source). Large beta-detection efficiencies were achieved. Right under the 1.5 mm thick aluminium floor of the optical chamber, we positioned a 2″x2″ CeBr3 detector. This detection system is accommodated within a large shielding enclosure with 5 cm-thick lead walls.
Analogue electronics was used to shape the pulses in both channels. The signals from the amplifiers were fed into Canberra 2037A single-channel analysers with pulse lockout logic that minimises out-of-channel event deadtime. An in-house digital coincidence selector was used to choose variable non-extending deadtimes and set the resolving times. A non-extending deadtime of 29 μs was used, as a safeguard against PMT afterpulses or scintillator phosphorescence. The delay spectra between the beta and gamma channel pulses had typical full width half maxima of 20 ns, but a coincidence window of 1.0 μs was used to capture all coincidences.
Efficiency variation was realized essentially by low-level discrimination; grey filtering was used only once. The counting times ranged from 120 s to 1 h per efficiency point, depending on the gamma setting and discrimination level, so that the relative standard deviations of the counting rates were always lower than 0.1%. Each of the four sources from the diluted and the mother solutions were measured at three gamma settings (thresholds before the first and second peaks and a window around the third peak).
2.3.2. 4πβ(PS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting
Beta-channel detection consists of a UPS-923 A plastic scintillator optically coupled to a selected low-noise one-inch diameter photomultiplier tube. The light-tight thin capsule that encloses this beta detector rests directly on the top of a 2″x2″ CeBr3 gamma detector. This setup is housed at the bottom of a 50-cm-diameter 5-cm-thick cylindrical lead shielding covered with an armour-plated sliding square 6 cm-thick.
The analogue electronics used is similar to the one discussed in section 2.3.1. The non-extending deadtime and resolving time were 29 μs and 1 μs, respectively. The beta detection efficiency was changed by electronic discrimination. Source measurement times per efficiency point varied between 120 s and 40 min, thus, ensuring the relative standard deviations of the counting rates were all lower than 0.1%.
2.3.3. Digital coincidence counting (DCC)
Both coincidence-counting systems described in the precedent sections can also be implemented with digital electronics. The digital electronics consists of a National Instruments (NI) equipment composed of a high-bandwidth chassis (NI PXIe-1085) with an embedded processor (NI PXIe-8880). The chassis accommodates a double-input digitizer adapter module (NI 5772) linked to a Kintex-7 FPGA (NI PXIe-7975 R) that samples both β- and γ-input channels at 100 MS/s sampling frequency with 12 bit resolution each. The acquired data are streamed to a RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) external hard-drive for storage (NI HDD-8266) until further processing configuring an “offline analysis” operation scheme. This transfer is made through a high-bandwidth connection (NI PXIe-8384). A timing and synchronization control card (NI PXIe-6672) ensures operating synchronicity and high precision timing due to a 10 MHz oscillator clock calibrated using a 100 MHz traceable frequency. More details about the digital system can be found in (Durán et al., 2018, 2020).
The control of the digital electronic system, data processing and analysis software are coded in LabVIEW™ (NI). The digital pulse processing (DPP) of the stream of pulses is made using Gaussian filters following the approach described by (Young and van Vliet, 1995 and Bobin et al., 2014) with pulse height analysis (PHA) and digital constant fraction discrimination (dCFD) algorithms to obtain amplitude and timestamp information (Durán et al., 2020a).
Data analysis for coincidence counting was also performed with a LabVIEW™ application. It consists of a series of modules that carry out the different steps in the calculation process: energy and time spectroscopy, energy threshold selection, deadtime application, search of β-γ coincidences, Cox-Isham formulation and efficiency extrapolation (Durán et al., 2018).
2.3.4. TDCR counting
This technique was implemented with our TDCR system (Nedjadi et al., 2015) using a MAC3-module (Bouchard and Cassette, 2000) with variable resolving time. The TDCR electronic system was adjusted for an optimal response for 161Tb. The thresholds were set at the valleys of the single-electron responses of the three PMTs. A study of the variation of the double and triple coincidence rates with the coincidence window, for Terbium sources, resulted in an optimal resolving time of 80 ns. The deadtime was set at 90 μs
Four sources, prepared as indicated above, were measured by voltage defocusing varying from 560 to 340 V in 20 V decrements. The sandblasted vials were measured by grey filtering, using 22 self-adhesive films of varying optical densities. These vials, and those reserved for the quench method, were measured with a constant focusing voltage set at 560 V.
The counting times ranged from 600 s to 1200 s and were chosen so that the relative standard deviations of the triple coincidence count rates remain lower than 0.1%. The observed triple-to-double coincidence ratio varied between 0.994 and 0.997 for defocusing measurement, between 0.963 and 0.996 for quenching, and 0.942 and 0.997 in the case of grey filtering.
2.3.5. Integral gamma counting
For gamma integral counting measurements, the nine sources in three geometries were placed into the well of a 127 × 127 NaI(Tl) single crystal produced by Quartz & Silice detector with 99.1% of 4π solid angle subtended from the bottom of the well. Contrary to usual practice, the threshold was not set at 22.6 keV, since this would cut the 25.7 keV peak of 161Tb, but was placed at about 13.5 keV. Measurements were carried out with both 15 and 25 μs deadtimes, for durations long enough to ensure the relative standard uncertainty was always lower than 0.1%.
2.3.6. Ionisation chamber
The three IER ampoules, two filled with the M161Tb3 solution and one with the M161Tb4 solution (see 2.1), and the two BIPM ampoules, filled with the M161Tb3 solution, were measured 3 times within a week after their preparation. The measurements were performed using the usual CIR procedure described above. Before each measurement, the ampoule was centrifuged to ensure optimal efficiency and reproducibility. A typical measurement cycle corresponds to the time needed to collect the charge produced by the ionisation in the chamber, and load a given capacitor up to 0.1 V six times. The final ionisation current is given by the mean and its standard deviation obtained from 20 consecutive readings of the current. A measurement sequence starts with a background measurement using a small 503 pF capacitor. A typical background value is 0.057 ± 0.002 pA. Two reference Caesium sources were measured with larger capacitors (30090 pF), after which the Terbium ampoules were measured with the same capacitor. Finally, another background measurement was performed with the small capacitor to complete the sequence. The results were used to calculate a CIR calibration factor for 161Tb. The ratio of the measured currents for the mother and diluted solutions can be compared with the gravimetric dilution factor.
2.3.7. HPGe gamma spectrometry
Spectrometric measurements were carried out with an n-type HPGe detector calibrated with an efficiency curves obtained using reference source traceable to international standards. Three polyethylene vials, two filled with aliquots of the diluted M161Tb4 solution and one with an aliquot of M161Tb3, were measured to assess gamma-emitting impurities. They were measured for 144, 119 and 25 live-hours respectively. Only one impurity of 160Tb was observed and the activities were calculated based on the 48, 57, 74, 87, 103, 106 and 292 keV gamma-lines for 161Tb and 298, 879, 966, 1177 and 1271 keV gamma-lines for 160Tb, respectively. Emission probabilities were from Nucléide-LARA database (Nucléide-LARA, 2011). The half-life used for 160Tb is 72.3 (2) days while that of 161Tb is 6.953 (2) days (Durán et al., 2020b, Durán et al., 2020a).
3. Results
3.1. Gamma spectrometry
A160Tb impurity was found in the gamma spectra acquired in the three separate measurements. The values of the ratio between 160Tb and 161Tb activities at the reference date were found to be consistent. The mean ratio is (4.533 ± 0.196)·10−5. Although this value is rather small, the 160Tb contribution cannot be neglected, as the ratio grows with time, so it requires correcting for in all the primary and secondary measurements.
3.2. Primary standardisations
3.2.1. 4πβ(LS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting
The 161Tb β-spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. Typically, the β-channel detection efficiency (εβ) was decreased from a maximum of 98.5% down to around 60%. Countrates in this channel varied from 15 to 12 kcps. The beta-background countrate is 0.3–1.5 cps, a mark of the selected low-noise photomultiplier tube used.

The gamma-ray spectrum is presented in Fig. 2. The three most intense gamma emissions at 25.7, 48.9 and 74.6 keV, respectively, are well separated. Here, the 25.7 keV peak is well attenuated by the aluminium base of the optical chamber. The measurements were performed with three-gamma channel settings: a discrimination threshold at 18.6 keV, before the first peak, a second one at 32.6 keV, before the 48.9 keV gamma emission, and a window around the third peak, between 63 and 157 keV. The γ-detection efficiencies for these three settings were around 4.0%, 3.5% and 0.7%, respectively. These comparatively low efficiencies partially reflect the low intensity low-energy gamma emission spectrum of this nuclide.

Fig. 3 displays typical efficiency extrapolations at these three gamma regimes. The upper curve fits the data for a window around the third peak. The green squares concern a threshold before the second peak, while the blue circles are for the threshold before the first peak. The golden curve also fits the data for a threshold before the first peak, but with grey filtering as the beta efficiency modifier. All the fits are cubic polynomials with non-zero quadratic terms. Linear fits and quadratic fits might be adequate for quite narrow regions at high efficiency, but are obviously not suitable for the efficiency range covered by the measurements.
Fig. 3. 161Tb 4πβ(LS)-γ(CeBr3) efficiency extrapolation curves. Black diamonds stand for a window around the third peak, green squares represent a threshold before the second peak and blue circles refer to measurements with a threshold before the first peak. The golden triangles also designate a threshold before the first peak, but here the efficiency variation is performed by grey filtering. The solid lines are cubic fits. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
The marked non-linearity of the extrapolation functions reflects the strong electron conversion (CE) present in the decay of 161Tb. In linear efficiency extrapolations, the slope accounts for the sensitivity of the beta detector to the gamma emissions, as well as its internal CE detection efficiency. When CE have energies higher than the range covered by electronic discrimination, the CE detection efficiency does not vary with εβ and contributes just a constant to the slope. However, 161Tb emits a significant amount of conversion and Auger electrons (~ 2.2 ē per beta particle per decay) (Lehenberger et al., 2011). It yields 39.3 keV of CE energy per decay spread in the 3.3–98.3 keV range (Champion et al., 2016). Hence, altering the threshold level and εβ inevitably changes the CE detection efficiency, thereby, giving rise to the non-linearity observed in the extrapolation function.
The relative residuals of the cubic efficiency extrapolation least-square fit, for the 18.6 keV threshold in the gamma channel, are displayed in Fig. 4 as an example. There are 63 degrees of freedom in this measurement. The residuals are shown merely to illustrate the spread of the data. In practice, this kind of fit is not used for determining the radioactive concentration. What is done, instead, is a Monte Carlo fit that takes the uncertainties of both εβ and ρβργ/ρc into account (Nedjadi et al., 2012). Ten thousand fits are performed by varying stochastically (1-εβ)/εβ and ρβργ/ρc within their distributions assumed to be Gaussian. The average of the intercept distribution is then taken to be the actual intercept while the standard deviation of the distribution is estimated to be the intercept uncertainty.
Fig. 4. Relative residuals of the 4πβ(LS)-γ(CeBr3) efficiency extrapolation curve for a gamma threshold at 18.6 keV.
The left side of Table 1 summarises the intercepts obtained for the four sources from the two solutions measured in the three gamma settings. The degrees of freedom of the thirteen efficiency extrapolations range from 46 to 68, with an average of 56. The uncertainties listed are the standard deviations of the intercept distributions, as explained above. The intercepts for the gamma window have the largest uncertainties, because of the poor gamma detection efficiency. The intercepts of each source for all gamma settings are compatible within 0.1%–0.6%. The arithmetic mean activities of the two sources from the diluted solution agree within 0.03% while the corresponding values for the two sources from the mother solution are compatible within 0.08%. The mean M161Tb3 activity concentration deviates by 0.34% from the equivalent quantity for M161Tb4 scaled by the gravimetric dilution factor. Combining the extrapolated activities of the four sources measured in the three gamma settings gives an arithmetic average of 16984.24 kBq g−1 at the date of reference.

Table 2 spells out the uncertainty budget assumed for this coincidence measurement. The background contribution is ΔBγ/Rγmin where ΔBγ is the maximum dispersion of the γ-background rate during the campaign, while Rγmin is the smallest γ-countrate measured at the three gamma settings. The half-life uncertainty refers to the maximum value of the propagation of the half-life uncertainty to the decay correction factors (latter measurements). The deadtime uncertainty is assumed to be Δτ × ρβ, where Δτ is the uncertainty of the deadtime and ρβ is an average beta countrate for the campaign. The resolving time uncertainty was estimated as uτR·(ρacc/ρcmax) where uτR is the relative standard uncertainty of the resolving time and ρacc the accidental coincidence countrate, while ρcmax is the largest measured true coincidence countrate. The weighing uncertainty listed is that of the lightest source of the whole set used. The counting statistics refers to a typical standard deviation of the mean of ρβ∙ργ/ρc. A median value of the relative standard deviations of the intercept distributions of all the measurements was used as the extrapolation uncertainty. The largest component accounts for reproducibility, i.e. it is the relative standard deviation of thirteen efficiency-extrapolated activities obtained with four sources from two dilutions, and three gamma settings. The combined uncertainty obtained from the quadratic sum of type-A and type-B uncertainties is 0.48% (k = 1).

3.2.2. 4πβ(PS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting
The β-spectrum for 161Tb generated by the UPS923A plastic scintillator and one-inch PMT is similar to the one shown in Fig. 1. For the two sources from M161Tb4, for which we used Ludox, εβ was lowered from a maximum of 95.4% down to about 65%. For the two sources from M161Tb3, prepared without Ludox, they produced lower efficiencies than the latter (one by only ~ 1% and the other by ~ 11%). Beta counting rates ranged from 18 to 12 kcps during the acquisitions. The low-noise PMT used had a background rate of 0.3–1.2 cps.
The resulting gamma-ray spectrum is also analogous to the profile displayed in Fig. 2 except that, in this case, the 25.7 keV peak is not depleted because the source sits directly on top of the Ce–Br3 detector. It has the same profile as the spectrum shown in Fig. 7 for DCC below. Here, a discrimination threshold at 19.1 keV was used, a second one at 31.8 keV, and a window ranging from 61 to 153 keV. The γ-detection efficiencies for these settings were about 9.0%, 7.1% and 1.6% respectively.
An example of efficiency extrapolations is shown in Fig. 5. Linear and quadratic fits might also be satisfactory, within limited intervals at small inefficiencies, but only cubic polynomials are adequate for covering the whole efficiency range.

Blue circles depict measurements with a threshold before the first peak, green triangles stand for a threshold before the second peak, while black diamonds represent a window around the third peak. The solid lines are cubic polynomial fits. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
Fig. 6 illustrates the relative residuals of the cubic efficiency extrapolation least-square fit, for the 19.1 keV threshold in the gamma channel. There are 55 degrees of freedom for this measurement. However, we do not use this method and we perform instead Monte Carlo fits that accommodate the uncertainties on both εβ and ρβργ/ρc, as explained in 3.2.1.

The left half of Table 3 lists the intercepts obtained for the four sources from the two solutions measured in the three gamma settings. These twelve efficiency extrapolations involve degrees of freedom ranging from 40 to 77, with an average of 54. The tabulated uncertainties include only the standard deviations of the intercept distributions, as explained above. Since the gamma gate results in the lowest detection efficiency, its associated intercepts have the largest uncertainties. The intercepts for different gamma settings cohere within 0.04%–1.1%. The mean activities of the two M161Tb4 sources match within 0.23%, while those for the two M161Tb3 sources are consistent within 0.6%. The average M161Tb3 activity concentration deviates by only 0.16% from that of the M161Tb4 solution normalised by the gravimetric dilution factor. Pooling the extrapolated activities of the four sources measured in the three gamma settings yields an arithmetic average of 17042.37 kBq g−1 at the date of reference.

Table 2 breaks down the uncertainty budget. The various components are defined as above. The biggest component is reproducibility, i.e. the relative standard deviation of twelve efficiency-extrapolated activities obtained with four sources from two dilutions and three gamma settings. The combined uncertainty obtained from the quadratic sum of type-A and type-B uncertainties is 0.70% (k = 1). The larger uncertainty compared to 4πβ(LS)-γ(CeBr3) reflects the larger dispersion of results using plastic scintillation for which the beta detection efficiency is comparatively lower.
3.2.3. Digital coincidence counting
Fig. 7 shows typical β and γ spectra obtained from a digital pulse processing of the 4πβ(PS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence measurements. They are consistent with the profiles presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2.
Fig. 7. 161Tb β (left) and γ (right) spectra measured with the 4πβ(PS)-γ(CeBr3) DCC system.
Three γ-energy conditions were selected: an 18 keV threshold (immediately before the first peak), and 32–62.5 keV and 63–157 keV windows around the second and third peaks respectively. εβ efficiency was varied by software between 90% and 70%, giving twenty data points for each γ-energy condition. The deadtime was set at 5 μs and the resolving time at 1 μs
Fig. 8 displays the data sets for each γ-energy condition obtained for one of the two plastic scintillation sources, the other yielding similar data. Third degree polynomials were adopted for the fits, which were performed by the least-squares method using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The justification for choosing cubic polynomials was discussed above. For the 63–157 keV window, the relative narrowness of the range of efficiency covered, in addition to the dispersion of the data, due to the much lower number of events for some sources, made a proper fitting unfeasible. As a result, this γ-energy condition was discarded altogether.

Table 3 (right side) tabulates the intercepts obtained for the four sources from the diluted and master solutions at various gamma conditions. The intercepts for different gamma settings are consistent within 0.05%–0.38% for the same source. The average activities of the two sources from the diluted solution concord within 1.04%. The two sources from the master solution have mean activities that deviate by 2.58%. However, the mean M161Tb3 activity concentration differs from that of the M161Tb4 solution multiplied by the gravimetric dilution factor by only 0.04%. The arithmetic average of all the intercepts from the four sources is 17001.05 kBq g−1 at the date of reference.
The uncertainty budget of this measurement is detailed in Table 2. The main contribution stems from the relative standard deviation of the eight extrapolated intercepts for the four sources in the two gamma settings. The combined uncertainty obtained with the quadratic sum of type-A and type-B uncertainties is 1.46% (k = 1).
When examining 4πβ(LS)-γ digital coincidence counting, the β- and γ-spectra obtained with this detection system were similar to those presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 εβ was varied in the 70 %–90% range. Compared to the γ spectrum in Fig. 7, this presents a depleted 25.65 keV γ-emission peak. This stems from the aluminum bottom of the chamber, which shields the CeBr3 detector surface, to some extent, from the rays emitted from the liquid scintillation vial.
Here, the offline analysis also focused on three gamma settings: 20 keV and 32 keV thresholds in the flat regions before the first and second peaks, and a 65–160 keV window, demarcating the third peak. Fig. 9 presents the data and extrapolation curves at these gamma conditions for a source from the master solution. As found above, the window on the third peak suffers of a larger extrapolation gap because of the lower maximum efficiency (0.8656 in this case), and more data dispersion, both of which lead to unreliable intercepts. This gamma setting was therefore excluded.

The DCC intercepts found for three sources from the M161Tb4 solution and three sources from the M161Tb3 solution, in the two gamma thresholds, are outlined in the right side of Table 1. The intercepts for the two gamma settings are consistent within 0.01%–0.2%. The sources from the diluted solution have mean activities that match within 0.5–1%, while those of the sources from the mother solution are compatible within 0.1–1.9%. The average activity concentrations of the M161Tb4 and M161Tb3 solutions differ by around 1%. Averaging the intercepts of the six sources calculated in the two gamma settings yielded 16944.69 kBq g−1 at the date of reference.
Table 4 displays the uncertainty budget of this measurement. The largest input comes from the relative standard deviation of the twelve extrapolated intercepts for the six sources in the two gamma conditions. The total relative uncertainty is 1.24% (k = 1).

3.2.4. TDCR method
The efficiencies and activities were calculated with our own Fortran code which takes the PMTs asymmetry and the micelle effect into account (Nedjadi et al., 2017). This code computes the efficiencies using the stochastic approach, in which the multimillion sampled energies of the beta particles or the conversion, Auger and photoelectrons produced in the vial are obtained from Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulations involving the Radioactivity and Atomic relaxation modules. Nuclear and atomic data used are from DDEP and ENSDF.
Fig. 10 sums up the activity concentrations predicted by the measurements and the model. A kB value of 0.011 cm MeV−1 was used throughout. The effect of the ionisation quenching factor kB on the activities was found to be inconsequential. For instance, the relative difference between using 0.0075 and 0.012 cm MeV−1 for kB was 0.02%, 0.04% and 0.03% for defocusing, grey filtering and quenching measurements, respectively. Each displayed activity is the average of 12, 22 or 11 counting points in the case of defocusing, grey filtering or quenching – in that order. The activities determined by defocusing are self-consistent within 0.1%, while their averages deviate by only 0.1% and 0.2% from the grey filtering and quenching values, respectively. Shown as a red line, the average TDCR activity concentration of the master solution agrees with that of the diluted solution, scaled by the gravimetric dilution factor, within 0.17%. Combining the activity concentrations of the two solutions gives an arithmetic mean of 17019.36 kBq g−1 at the date of reference.
Fig. 10. TDCR measurements of the master and diluted solutions. The empty stars and the full one represent the defocusing activity values and their average, respectively, for the diluted solution, while the empty squares and the full one stand for the corresponding measurements in the case of the master solution. Red lines are arithmetic averages per solution. Standard uncertainties (k = 1) are given in all cases. The measurements uncertainties displayed here include only the standard deviations of the activities entailed by the counting points constitutive of a single measurement. The dashed lines indicate the full standard uncertainty combining all components for each solution. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
The full uncertainty budget is detailed in Table 5. The background component was estimated using a defocusing measurement. One thousand sets of correlated random Gaussian background coincidence counting rates were generated for each counting point. The simulated rates have mean values, standard deviations of the means and covariance matrices in agreement with the measured background rates. Corresponding net counting rates were generated by subtracting the Monte Carlo background rates from the measured gross counting rates. The 103 defocusing data sets were then fed into the code that computes the efficiencies and activities. The standard deviation of the distribution of the activities thus obtained was assumed to be the propagation of the background uncertainty on the activity.

The half-life contribution was computed conservatively as the propagation of the half-life uncertainty to the decay correction factors for the latter measurements. The uncertainties of the intensities of the four main beta branches, 65(4) %, 25.7(16) %, and twice 5 (5) % were focused on as the decay scheme uncertainty. The activities of a sample, measured with defocusing, were computed using beta intensity sets in which the intensities of these branches took their maximal and minimal values while keeping the sum constant. The decay scheme uncertainty was then assumed to be the relative standard deviation of the consequent activities assuming a rectangular distribution.
Since both kB and the stopping power correlate through partaking in the Birks formula, one cannot propagate their uncertainties separately. With regard to the propagation of the uncertainties of the ionisation quenching function and parameter, the procedure used was as follows. Separate sets of 2 × 103 uniform deviates of kB lying between 0.0075 and 0.0120 cm MeV−1 were randomly generated, assuming a rectangular distribution, and then coupled with five ionisation quenching functions to compute altogether 104 activities. Four of these ionisation quenching functions are obtained from the ESTAR stopping powers (Berger, 1993), and those of (Gümüs et al., 2010) and (Tan et al., 2012), whereas the fifth is that of (Grau Malonda et al., 1999). This calculation was made for the defocusing measurement discussed above. The relative standard deviation of the 104 activities thus generated is 0.2%.
With regard to the counting statistics contribution, one thousand sets of correlated random Gaussian net coincidence counting rates were generated for each of the counting points of a defocusing measurement. These sets of Monte Carlo simulated rates were generated in such a way as to reproduce the corresponding experimental moments and covariance matrices. These rates were then fed into the code that computes the efficiencies and activities. The ESTAR stopping powers were used and kB was fixed at 0.011 cm MeV−1. The standard deviation of the distribution of the activities thus obtained was assumed to be the propagation of the rates’ pdfs on the activity.
The last component is that of reproducibility, computed here as the relative standard deviation of 12 activities obtained with the sets of sources from two solutions using three efficiency variation methods. The combined relative standard uncertainty obtained from the quadratic sum of these contributions is 0.33%.
3.2.5. Gamma integral counting
Integral counting with a well-type NaI(Tl) detector and efficiencies calculated with GEANT Monte Carlo simulations was also used to standardise the activity concentration.
The Geant 4 Monte Carlo efficiency calculations were made using the Radioactivity module for sampling various nuclear decay paths of 161Tb, and the Atomic relaxation module for simulating the generation of X-rays and Auger electrons by Dy atoms. Using the ENSDF data, the calculations yielded 0.5540(7), 0.4684(6), and 0.4923 (8) for the efficiencies in the disk, gsv and pev geometries, in that order. The activities determined with this set of efficiencies yielded activities lower by about 23% than the expected results in the three geometries.
We are certain that the discrepancy originates from the efficiency calculations, because independent gamma measurements were performed in parallel with a different preamplifier, with digital electronics and signal processing, using different sets of deadtimes. When combining these measurements with the Monte Carlo efficiencies, one gets the same discrepancies as those obtained with analogue electronics.
We explored the possibility that slight variations, within tolerances, in the geometries of the samples may produce large efficiency changes, which would mean that this technique does not have the accuracy required for the measurement of this low-energy photon-emitting nuclide. However, the efficiencies calculated varied by merely 2–3% from those predicted using the proper geometries.
To explore whether the alternative sets of gamma emission probabilities may account for the discrepancies, we are in the process of computing the efficiencies with the Nucléide-LARA data, the JEFF data (JEFF, 2017) as well as with a set of gamma emission probabilities we determined ourselves. Since the X-ray emissions contribute about half the detection efficiency, we plan to explore the extent to which variations in the X-ray emissions may account for the discrepancies.
3.3. Reference ionisation chamber measurements
The measurements of the currents produced in our reference ionisation chamber by the M161Tb3 solution in the form of IER and BIPM ampoules are shown in Fig. 11. The contribution of the 160Tb impurity is corrected for with a calibration factor obtained with the response curve of the CIR chamber (Juget et al., 2020). This contribution is around 0.06%. Good agreement is found between the measurements of each ampoule type. The average normalised current is 58.705 ± 0.063 pA/g for IER ampoules and 57.474 ± 0.060 pA/g for BIPM ampoules. The difference between these two values, about 1.23 pA/g, is explained by the different geometry of the two ampoules, their glass wall thicknesses and their filling level.
Fig. 11. Current value for the three measurements in the ionisation chamber for the IER (left) and BIPM (right) ampoules. The current is normalised with the mass of the solution contained in each ampoule.
Using these currents and the activity concentration obtained from the primary measurements, a calibration factor, called equivalent activity Ae, can be calculated for our chamber, for both the IER and BIPM ampoule geometries. It was determined that Ae IER = 219.05 ± 1.32 (0.602%) MBq and Ae BIPM = 223.40 ± 1.33 (0.595%) MBq.
In a previous exploratory standardisation, we had used the tentative estimated activity concentration to calibrate the chamber. The solution used in that exercise contained an HCl and α-hydroxyisobutyric acid mixture, with a larger density than that of the solution used in this standardisation. The new equivalent activity deviates by 5.3% from the tentative value we had determined earlier, so this rather low-energy photon emitter underscores the need to pay attention to the consistency between the chemical form and density of the solution used for calibration and those of the solution to be standardised secondarily. The same holds true for the consistency and homogeneity of the containers used in such secondary standardisations.
The three measurements of the IER ampoules containing the diluted solution M161Tb4 yield an average activity concentration of 1.8095 ± 0.0111 MBq/g. Using this value and its counterpart for the M161Tb3 solution gives a dilution factor of 9.4167 ± 0.0814, which is in agreement with the gravimetric dilution factor.
4. Discussion
Fig. 12 compares the activity concentrations determined by the primary standardisations performed in this study. The red line refers to the arithmetic mean of the activity concentrations predicted with 4πβ(PS or LS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting with analogue electronics. Analogue coincidence counting measurements with plastic or liquid scintillants are in good agreement; they deviate by 0.34%. The DCC results also display a comparable consistency, with a relative difference of 0.33%, though, in this case, the uncertainty bars are quite large. The analogue and digital coincidence counting activity concentrations are compatible within standard uncertainties, but the average of the plastic and liquid scintillation DCC activities is 0.23% lower than its analogue counterpart. All the β-γ coincidence determinations match the TDCR prediction. The TDCR value differs by only 0.04% and 0.27% from the analogue and digital coincidence counting means, respectively.

The red line is the arithmetic average of the activity concentrations predicted with 4πβ(PS or LS)-γ(CeBr3) coincidence counting with analogue electronics. The black dashed lines represent the standard uncertainties (k = 1) of this average. The square and circle refer to plastic and liquid scintillation coincidence values respectively, while the diamond and triangle denote their digital counterparts in that order. The facing triangles refers to the TDCR measurement. The error bars in the plot are also standard uncertainties. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
Using high precision balances gives a dilution factor with a very low relative standard uncertainty, determined to be lower than 0.01% in this case. This factor, thus, provides a useful test to check the internal coherence of the various standardisations. Fig. 13 shows the ratios of the activity concentrations of the M161Tb3 solution divided by those of the M161Tb4 solution, for the β-γ coincidence measurements and the TDCR determination. Other than the 4πβ(LS)-γ DCC dilution factor, the rest of the factors are in good agreement with the gravimetric dilution factor.

An ampoule of the M161Tb3 solution was submitted to the BIPM as a contribution to the Système International de Référence. The activity concentration supplementing the contribution was calculated as the average of the analogue plastic and liquid scintillation β-γ coincidence counting activity determinations, i.e. the mean of twenty five efficiency extrapolated activities obtained with eight sources, from two dilutions, and three gamma settings, with degrees of freedom ranging from 40 to 77. It was estimated to be 17012.14 kBq g−1, with a total relative standard uncertainty of 0.58%. The DCC β-γ coincidence determinations were not included in this mean, despite their compatibility with their analogue counterparts, because of the narrow efficiency domain they cover and their rather smaller degrees of freedom. As for excluding the TDCR result from the average, even if it is in excellent agreement with the analogue coincidence measurements, it is justified by the dependence of the double and triple efficiencies on the decay scheme, which is yet to be corroborated robustly. Although the main uncertainties in the decay scheme parameters were taken into account in the TDCR uncertainty budget, the TDCR value was not included in the final average by way of precaution.
5. Conclusion
As part of a larger project to support the use of 161Tb for nuclear imaging and radionuclide therapy, a solution of this nuclide supplied by the Paul Scherrer Institute was standardised using coincidence counting, with plastic and liquid scintillation in the beta channel, as well as the TDCR method. The solution had impactful traces of 160Tb impurity.
The β-γ coincidence measurements achieved high beta detection efficiencies but comparatively low efficiencies in the gamma channel, in part because of the low-intensity low-energy gamma emission spectrum of 161Tb. Cubic efficiency extrapolations were required for all the gamma settings. This non-linearity of the extrapolation functions reflects the strong electron conversion and its wide energy spread in the decay of 161Tb. Analogue coincidence counting measurements with plastic or liquid scintillants were found to be self-consistent and mutually compatible. Their DCC counterparts also presented a satisfactory internal coherence and agreed with each other. The analogue and digital coincidence counting activity concentrations were reciprocally consistent within standard uncertainties. All the β-γ coincidence measurements were found to be congruent with the TDCR determination. The gravimetric dilution factor was found to be consistent with those predicted by most standardisation methods.
The gamma integral counting standardisation of this radionuclide was not successful. Geant4 Monte Carlo calculations of the detection efficiency using the Radioactivity and Atomic relaxation modules that correctly treats the generation of all X-rays and Auger electrons yield large activity discrepancies. Alternative sets of gamma-emission probabilities and X-ray emissions are being investigated as possible sources of the large discrepancies.
An ampoule of the standardised solution was submitted to the BIPM as a contribution to the Système International de Référence.
