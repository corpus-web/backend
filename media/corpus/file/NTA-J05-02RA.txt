Abstract The objective of this study was to compare the radionuclidic product profiles of the primary source 99Mo- sodium   molybdate   (99MoO42-)   solution   obtained   after dissolution of nuclear reactor-irradiated sintered molybde- num discs with the profiles obtained for linear accelerator- irradiated discs. Radionuclidic analysis was performed by high-purity germanium c-ray spectrometry. Samples were analyzed at multiple time points and radioactivity levels in order to observe short lived and low activity radionuclidic long-lived impurities. Results obtained showed that the radionuclidic profiles from the two technologies are con- sistent between samples, and are unique for either pro- duction technology.

Introduction
A vast majority of medical radioisotope 99mTc is currently produced in nuclear reactors with an indirect method (99Mo-99mTc generator) in which 99Mo is a fission product. Unfortunately, this production technique has a number of disadvantages. First of all, the facility is not available around the world and also expensive. Second, fission pro- duction also requires very complex separations of the final product from highly toxic products [1], and the need for complex management and treatment processes of the highly radioactive products and wastes, including volatile nuclides like 131I and 133Xe [1]. Also, facilities for pro- duction and purification require heavy shielding due to high energy c-rays emitting products like 140La. Last, nuclear waste produced by reactors raises numerous safety and security concerns.
Recent shutdowns of nuclear reactors have caused glo- bal shortages of vital radioisotopes, including 99mTc, resulting in cancellation of critical medical procedures, and leading to research and development of alternate sources of 99Mo production by various global institutions [2, 3].
99mTc could be produced directly using proton bom-
bardment via the 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc nuclear reaction [4]. The cyclotron production [5, 6] of 99mTc by using a natural molybdenum as a target material is very advantageous, because molybdenum is metallic form, has a good thermal and electrical conductivity, it is very high melting point (2896 K), and of its low buying cost. Also, hospital-based location of cyclotrons gives much secured delivery of pharmaceuticals to patients, bringing the risk of transport accidents is practically zero.
However, the very short half-life of 99mTc (6.02 h) means that the isotope must be used quickly after pro- duction, limiting its use geographically to the area close to the cyclotron facility. Also, depending on proton energy and nature impurities in the target, irradiation could lead to isotopic impurities of technetium as a result of cross-re- action (natMo(p,xn)99m, 96(m?g), 95g, 95m, 94g Tc) [5, 6].
The processes of neutron capture, 98Mo(n,c)99Mo, molybdenum-100 transmutation, 100Mo(c,n)99Mo, have been also has been proposed as an alternatives to traditional 99Mo/99mTc generators [3]. Together with cyclotron pro- duction, these methods have advantageous in utilizing stable molybdenum as the starting materials, as opposed to the use of highly radioactive and security-risk uranium-235 (235U) in nuclear reactor fission 99Mo production. Also, volume of radioactive waste produced by these methods is far less and much less hazardous than the radioactive waste of research reactors. For mentioned above alternative methods, the risks due to nuclear-power accidents are zero, because there is no need for controlled chain reactions. Finally, accelerators do not pose a nuclear weapon prolif- eration risk.
With neutron capture where is a higher cross-sections that results in higher yields and also higher potential impurities; besides, separating the product nuclides from the targets is challenging since the chemical properties of parent and daughter nuclides are identical.
Even though the yields of (c,p) reactions are typically lower than for (c,n), these proton-rich isotopes have the advantage that target and product nuclides belong to dif- ferent chemical species allowing for more straightforward chemical separation.
The Canadian Light Source (CLS)1 in Saskatoon, Sas- katchewan in collaboration with Prairie Isotope Production Enterprise in Winnipeg, Manitoba are developing linear accelerator technology for the production of 99Mo [7]. The Missouri University Research Reactor (Columbia, MO) is the major proponent of the neutron capture production of 99Mo in the United States; in partnership with other insti- tutions for process optimization, purification and com- mercialization [8]. The major challenge with the two alternative methods of production is that they produce low-
to-medium specific activity 99Mo and therefore the tech- nologies cannot use currently established methods which employ alumina separation for 99mTc extraction from 99Mo [9].
It is logical to expect, and it has been reported, that the radionuclidic purity and impurity profiles (including pres- ence of other molybdenum radionuclides) formed during irradiations are affected significantly by the production technology used, the isotopic composition of the molyb- denum starting material and the specific irradiation parameters employed in the production process [1, 8, 9].
This study set out to perform high purity germanium (HPGe) c-ray spectroscopy on irradiated products and to evaluate the impurity profiles of the 99Mo produced during the irradiation of natural Mo targets using the two alter-  native methods.Experimental
Reagent grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (Oakville, ON) and unless otherwise stated were used as received. Procedures for the production of 99Mo by linear accelerator irradiation of the natural Mo discs at Canadian Light Source (CLS, Saskatoon, Canada) and nuclear reactor-irradiation at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR, Columbia, MO) have been previously described [10, 11]. Five neutron capture sam- ples and three from linear accelerator-irradiated (LINAC) were analyzed. Hydrogen peroxide (30 %, Sigma-Aldrich Oakville, ON) was used to dissolve the irradiated Mo. On completion of dissolution, the solvent was evaporated to constant weight, and the resulting powder was dissolved in sodium hydroxide (5 M NaOH) to produce 99Mo–Na2MoO4 solution from which samples were obtained for HPGe c-ray spectroscopy.
Radioactivity was determined in a dose calibrator (CRC®-55tR, Capintec, Ramsey, NJ) calibrated with cobalt-57 (57Co) and cesium-137 (137Cs) sealed reference
sources. Off-line HPGe spectroscopy measurements were performed on CANBERRA at fixed 5 and 45 cm distances from the detector. The longer distance was used for the higher activity samples. The detector was calibrated at the fixed 5 cm geometry using standard sources of 57Co, 60Co, 137Cs (Eckert and Ziegler, Berlin-Germany). To capture shorter and longer lived radionuclides, samples were ana- lyzed on multiple days—days 4, 7, 10, 17 and 39 after the end of irradiation (EOI) for neutron capture samples, and days 4, 6, 9, 16 and 37 after the end of bombardment (EOB) for LINAC discs.
Results and discussions
Due to similar results for HPGe analysis of the five neutron capture samples and three from LINAC that were analyzed, we presented the representative spectra of multiple data  points for one sample from each source. As seen in Figs. 1 and 2, all samples (both from neutron capture and LINAC) display peaks on their spectra that have energies charac- teristic  of  99Mo  and  99mTc  at  140.51;  181.06;  366.42;
739.50; 777.92; 822.97; and 960.75 keV [12]. In addition
to these characteristic 99Mo/99mTc peaks, the neutron capture samples (Fig. 1; Table 1) displayed peaks attributable to 187W (479.53 and 685.77 keV respectively, half-life 23.72 h), 95Nb (765.79 keV, half-life 34 days).
Also starting on day 17, a peak attributable to 92mNb (934. 46 keV, half-life 10 days) was observed (Fig. 1; Table 1).
In [9] the authors showed that the tungsten (W) impurity found in the molybdenum target used for the neutron capture method can lead to formation of 187W, and

subsequent decay of 187W to 188Re. Due to the short half- life of 187W, the peaks associated with this radionuclide on the spectra clearly disappear after day 7.
Although there is significant similarity in chemical properties between 188Re and 99mTc with the potential of co-elution of the former as a radioactive impurity in sub- sequent 99mTc extractions from parent 99Mo, we have not detected by HPGe spectroscopy any traces of 187W as an impurity in our product 99mTc solutions [11]. The levels of radionuclidic impurities that could be present in 99Mo prepared by the neutron activation process of an enriched 98Mo target have been discussed in [9, 11, 13, 14]. These are mainly 92mNb, 187W, 95Nb, 182Ta and 60Co.
For the linear accelerator-irradiated natural Mo samples a number of energy peaks were observed in the HPGe spectroscopy (Fig. 2; Table 2). Significantly, these peaks were predominantly due to radionuclides of niobium and the observed peaks appeared for all three of the LINAC  samples. The latter shows great consistency in the irradi- ation process of natural Mo targets using linear accelerator technology. The distinguishable peaks were identified as radionuclide impurities with both shorter and longer half- life and include 91mNb, 92mNb, 95mNb, 95Nb and 96Nb  (Table 2). The impurities and subsequent reactions that occur in molybdenum for the nuclides of interest have also been reported in [15–17]. Impurity peaks for 96Nb show up initially, but disappear rapidly due to the shorter half-life (23.35 h). By day 16, 96Nb peaks are undetectable and peaks for 91mNb, 92mNb, 95mNb and 95Nb are clearly prominent (half-life 60.86 days, 10.15 days, 86.6 h, and
35.15days, respectively).
Similar results for sintered natural molybdenum disc were reported in [10] with 99Mo production at a different facility and with irradiation in an electron linear accelerator of different configurations (Mevex, Stittsville, ON).
As expected, as the samples decayed, all the peaks decreased in intensity and on days 37–39, only the peaks

with initial high intensity and long half-lives were seen on the HPGe spectra for both neutron capture and LINAC samples irradiation (Fig. 3). The spectra for the LINAC samples on day 37 had fewer impurities. The 182Ta, 60Co and 124Sb peaks produced from 181Ta(n,c) 182Ta, 59Co(n,c) 60Co, 123Sb(n,c) 124Sb [13] reactions were observed in the neutron capture samples on day 39 are not observed in the LINAC irradiation spectra (Fig. 3). The presence of the tantalum is most likely due to the fact that niobium and tantalum are found together in the nature and both have
strong chemical similarity which makes it difficult to refine either metal from the other.
such as niobium and tungsten in the spectra must be taken into consideration when designing methods for the effi-  cient extraction of the clinically relevant 99mTc radioiso- tope in order to satisfy USP requirements when making radiopharmaceuticals.
Given the consistency of these results, data obtained for multiple batches can be used to create a unique c-ray spectrum library for each source of 99Mo isotopes (nuclear reactor or linear accelerator), as well as results for reaction conditions (beam, target and holder characteristics, and irradiation and cooling times) optimization in order to maximize the amount of 99Mo obtained and minimize impurities produced.
