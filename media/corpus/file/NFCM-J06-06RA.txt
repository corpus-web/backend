Abstract
A new U(VI) complex with methanesulfonic acid was obtained [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)]. Its crystal structure was determined using X-ray single crystal diffractometry. The compound crystallizes in P21/n space group. Main crystallographic data: a = 8.6825(6) Å, b = 8.0551(6) Å, c = 8.9298(7) Å, β = 102.162(1)˚, V = 610.52(8) Å3, Z = 4. Compound has a layered structure, with hydroxyl ions being bridging bidentate ligands and anions of methanesulfonic acid playing the role of bridging tridentate ligands. Np(VI) complex [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)], was also obtained and found to be isostructural to previously studied 1D polymorph of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)]. Main crystallographic data: space group P21/c, a = 11.2415(3) Å, b = 7.9174(2) Å, c = 10.8772(3) Å, β = 99.656(1)˚, V = 954.39(4)Å3, Z = 4. IR and UV–VIS–NIR spectra confirm structures of the compounds.
Introduction
There are several actinide complexes with methanesulfonic acid described in the literature. In the structure of [NpO2(CH3SO3)(MeIm)(H2O)], methanesulfonate-ion plays the role of a bridging bidentate ligand connecting neighbouring Np(V) atoms into infinite chains, while 1-methyl-imidazole molecules (MeIm) act as monodentate ligands coordinating to metal atoms via N atom [1]. Chains formation is also supported by the presence of cation-cation bonds so that neptynyl O atoms coordinate adjacent Np atoms. In the structure of Np(IV) oxalate (HIm)2[Np(C2O4)(CH3SO3)2(H2O)2], methanesulfonate-ion acts as a monodentate ligand, and the chains are formed due to the coordination of metal atoms by tetradentate oxalate ions [2]; protonated imidazole (Im) molecules play the role of outer sphere cations. Presence of bi- and tridentate bridging methanesulfonate-ions in the structure of [UO2(CH3SO3)2] results in the formation of layers where each of U atoms is connected to five different methanesulfonate-ions [3]. One of the polymorph modifications of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)] also exhibits layered structure. In this structure, methanesulfonate-ion functions as a bridging bidentate ligand [4]. In the second polymorph structure, methanesulfonate-ions also coordinate metal atoms in bidentate mode, but the compound has one-dimensional structure [5].
In this paper, we present synthesis, crystal structure and spectral properties of new U(VI) complex with methanesulfonate-ion [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)], as well Np(VI) complex [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)], which is isostructural to β-polymorph of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)].
Experimental
Synthesis
For synthesis of neptunyl methanesulfonate [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)] (1), NpO2(OH)2 was dissolved in ~ 0.1 M water solution of methanesulfonic acid, then imidazolium methanesulfonate was added up to Np:Im ratio of 1:2. Evaporation at room temperature of this solution resulted in the formation of crystals of compound 1.
For synthesis of uranyl methanesulfonate [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)] (2), UO3 was dissolved in a minimal amount of ~ 0.1 M water solution of methanesulfonic acid, then isonicotinic acid was added up to U:Isonic ratio of 1:2. Evaporation at room temperature of this solution resulted in the formation of crystals of compound 2.
X-ray diffractometry
The data were collected on a Bruker KAPPA APEX II with a CCD area detector using graphite monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. A single crystal was mounted on a glass fiber and transferred to the goniometer for data collection. The crystal was cooled to 100 K under a cold nitrogen gas stream. Data collection was handled using the APEX 2 software [6]. Frame integration, including Lorentz-polarization corrections, and final cell parameters were handled using SAINT + software [7]. The data were corrected for absorption using redundant reflections using the SADABS program [8]. The structure was solved using direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXL program [9]. All non-hydrogen atoms were readily located, and their positions were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of water molecule (1) were also located. Hydrogen atoms belonging to methyl groups were placed in calculated positions. Main crystal data and details of final refinement calculations are presented in Table 1. Main interatomic distances are listed in Table 2. Crystallographic data are deposited to CSD (CCDC 1,563,371 and 1,563,372).

Spectroscopy
UV–VIS–NIR and IR spectra of the crystalline complexes were measured at room temperature using Shimadzu UV3100 and Shimadzu IR Prestige 21 spectrometers, over the ranges of 4000–400 cm−1 (resolution 1 cm−1, 60 scans) and 400–1300 nm (resolution 1 nm, slit width 1 nm), respectively. Samples of ~ 2 wt% of the solids were prepared by the common procedure: pressing of a finely dispersed mixture of the compound with melted NaCl.
Results and discussion
Neptunium complex [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)], is isostructural to the described earlier β-polymorph of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)]. Coordination polyhedron of Np atom is a pentagonal bipyramide with the equatorial plane occupied by oxygen atoms of one water molecule and four different methanesulfonate anions (Fig. 1). The neptunyl group is near linear and symmetrical with Np-O distances equal to 1.747 and 1.753 Å, O-Np-O angle is equal to 179.7˚. Methanesulfonate anions acting as bidentate bridging ligands links adjacent Np atoms with the formation of infinite chains parallel to [100] (Fig. 2).

The equatorial Np-O distances are equal to 2.374–2.379 and 2.454 Å for oxygen atoms of CH3SO3− anions and water molecule, respectively. These values are in agreement with corresponding values found in the isostructural uranyl methanesulfonate (2.377–2.386 and 2.467 Å, respectively). The S–O distances corresponding to methanesulfonic acid anions are also similar for Np and U compounds. For β-[UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)] they are equal to 1.436–1.439 and 1.468–1.479 Å for free and coordinating O atoms, respectively. For the structure of the compound 1 these values are equal to 1.441–1.444 and 1.467–1.478 Å.
In the structure of [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)], the coordination polyhedron of U atom is a pentagonal bipyramide. The UO2 group has close to symmetrical and linear geometry with U–O distances equal to 1.773 and 1.782 Å, and O–U–O angle equal to 177.8˚ (Fig. 3). There are two oxygen atoms belonging to OH− ions and three oxygen atoms of CH3SO3− anions in the equatorial plane of U atom coordination polyhedron. The U–O distances to oxygen atoms of hydroxyl ions are equal to 2.308 and 2.316 Å, while U–O distances for methanesulfonate-ions oxygen atoms are significantly longer and ranged from 2.447 to 2.460 Å. Each of the methanesulfonate-ions play the role of tridentate ligand and coordinates three different U atoms.

Hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands and connect neighbouring U atoms with the formation of infinite [UO2OH] chains. In turn, the U atoms from the different chains are linked by the methanesulfonate ions so that the formation of [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)] infinite layers is observed (Fig. 4). Methansulfonate-ions play the role of tridentate ligands and connect metal centers belonging to the same chain in bidentate mode, while the third O atom of each methansulfonate ion coordinates U atom located in an adjacent chain.

Comparing characteristics of layers in the structure of 2 and other U(VI) compounds with methanesulfonic acid we can observe that the formation of 8- or 16-membered metallorings (UOSO)2 or (UOSO)4, is typical for all these complexes. There are also 6- and 12-membered metallorings present in the structure of 2 (UOOHUOSO) and (UOOHUOSO)2, whose formation is caused by the presence of the bridging OH− group. In the structure of [UO2(CH3SO3)2], formation of both 8- and 16-membered metallorings is observed (Fig. 5), while only 16-membered metallorings are found in the structure of the layered α-modification of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)] (Fig. 6).

It is worth noting that a significant dispersion in the equatorial distances between U and methanesulfonate O atoms is observed for the known uranyl methanesulfonates. The maximal values (2.446–2.460 Å) are found in the structure of the compound 2 where all anions of methanesulfonic acid are tridentate. In the structure of [UO2(CH3SO3)2], U–O distances for bidentate and tridentate CH3SO3− anions lie in the range from 2.361 to 2.419 and from 2.409 to 2.444 Å, respectively. In the structure of α- and β-polymorphs of [UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)], where anions of methanesulfonic acid play the role of bidentate ligand, the corresponding U–O distances are equal to 2.363–2.399 and 2.377–2.386 Å, respectively.
Methanesulfonic acid anion coordination also impacts the values of S–O distances. In the case of bidentate coordination, the S–O distances for free and coordinating O atoms are significantly different and equal to 1.432–1.439 and 1.463–1.488 Å, respectively. For tridentate coordination these values range from 1.444 to 1.473 Å.
In the IR spectra of 1 and 2, stretching vibrations of AnO22+ groups are observed in the typical for An(VI) complexes spectral region (Table 3). Vibrations of SO3 and CS groups are slightly shifted to higher frequencies as compared to spectrum of methanesulfonic acid [10]. It should be noted that the number of bands corresponding to ν(SO3) in the spectrum of 2 is twice as much as in the spectrum of methanesulfonic acid, that can be explained by tridentate coordination of the anion and corresponding vibrations degeneracy of vibrations removal. The band at 3332 cm−1 in the spectrum of 1 corresponds to H2O vibrations. In the high frequency region of the spectrum of 2, monotonic absorption is observed, most probably caused by occluded water, with a weak peak at 3412 cm−1 that can be attributed to ν(OH) vibration of bridging hydroxyl ion. Deformation vibration band δ(OH) at ~ 1000 cm−1 is masked by strong absorption of methanesulfonic acid.

It is worth noting that although crystal structure of methanesulfonic acid has not yet been described, the vibrational spectra of methanesulfonic acid and its complexes with different metals, as well as the spectra of trihalogenated methanesulfonates CX3SO3− (X = Cl, F), has been studied for many years [11]. Experimental and quantum chemistry calculations data show that stretching vibrations of CH3 groups are observed in the similar regions and weakly influenced by the nature of the metal center. The difference in ν(SO3) for various complexes is more prominent and depends both on the composition of the complexes and their structural characteristics, which is also confirmed by the results for complexes 1 and 2.
Optical spectra of the compounds reflect electronic configuration of central atom as well as the nature of the ligands. VIS–NIR spectrum of the compound 1 is shown in Fig. 7. There are several weak absorption bands in the 900–1400 nm region of the spectrum, with a stronger band observed at 1228 nm which corresponds to the electron transition between the ground state and 2F7/2 multiplet whose energy depends on the magnitude of the spin–orbit and crystal field interactions. For all bands, the red shift is observed as compared to spectra of nitrate and perchlorate solutions [12, 13]. All bands in the 500–800 nm range are also shifted to the low frequency region as compared to theoretical and experimental data for (NpO2Cl4)2− [14].

Optical spectrum of 2 (Fig. 8) contains a series of well resolved bands corresponding to low energy electron transitions which is typical for uranyl compounds [15]. The strongest of these bands is shifted to low energy region as compared to hydrated UO22+ cation (409 nm) [16] and is observed at 425 nm.

Conclusions
We have described two novel complexes of Np(VI) and U(VI) with anion of methanesulfonic acid. Crystals of [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)] and [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)] were obtained during isothermal evaporation of the solutions that contained NpO2 or UO2 methansulfonates as well as imidazolium methansulfonate or isonicotinic acid, respectively. In contrast to all previously described uranyl methanesulfonates, the bridging hydroxyl-ion is observed in the structure of [UO2(OH)(CH3SO3)]. The presence of this bridging anion results in the formation of the [UO2OH] infinite chains that are further linked into infinite layers due to the tridentate bridging coordination of methanesulfonate-ions. Neptunyl methanesulfonate [NpO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)], is found to be isostructural to β-[UO2(CH3SO3)2(H2O)]. Geometrical characteristics for U and Np complexes are similar. Spectral properties of the complexes confirm their crystal structures.
