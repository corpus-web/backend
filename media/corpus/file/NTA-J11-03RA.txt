Increasing interest in the treatment of human disease by means of targeted radionuclide-based therapies requires an accurate understanding of achievable yields and quantiﬁcation of realisable degrees of  purity.  Important  studies  within  a  more  extensive  Coordinated  Research  Project  of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA CRP) have included in-depth assessments and evaluations of all available measured cross-section data for ten nuclear reactions leading to the formation of 131Cs, 131Ba, 225Ac, 225Ra, 227Th, 227Ac, 230U and 230Pa for  various  on-going  and  proposed therapeutic applications in nuclear medicine. Equivalent studies were also undertaken of possible reactions to produce the 178W/low-spin 178mTa generator system that has been clinically applied in diagnosis by means of SPECT - these particular cross-section studies and recommendations are included in this paper for completeness. All available measured data have been critically reviewed and assessed to produce statistically consistent datasets. Selected datasets have been ﬁtted by a least-squares method with Pad´e approximations of variable order to evaluate the production cross sections and corresponding uncertainties. New measurements have  been  made  in  some  instances, and reported data have been adjusted to accommodate new nuclear decay or monitor reaction data which altered the  original  reported  quantities  adversely.  Insuﬃcient  measured  data  are  available in many cases to permit a reliable evaluation of cross sections, and these instances are discussed. Recommended therapeutic radionuclide production reaction data and their uncertainties are available on the Web page of the IAEA Nuclear Data Section at www-nds.iaea.org/radionuclides/ and also at the IAEA medical portal www-nds.iaea.org/medportal/ .
I.INTRODUCTION
Several decades of concentrated research and develop- ment for medically appropriate radionuclides have increas- ingly created opportunities for such radionuclides in diag- nostic and therapeutic applications [1, 2]. The production of these radionuclides is an important non-energy related application of nuclear science for the successful treatment of a wide range of ailments in human health. Reliable and high-quality nuclear data are essential to guarantee safe and eﬃcient therapeutic treatments [3–5].
Therapeutic radionuclides are commonly produced via reactions induced by either charged or neutral particles. The variety of relevant reactions has grown as the number of therapeutic radionuclides under study has expanded, and in many cases the measured datasets reported in the literature are discrepant. Eﬀorts have been made to rec- oncile these diﬀerences through expert evaluations of the data combined with statistical analysis in a Coordinated Research Project (CRP) of the International Atomic En- ergy Agency (IAEA) that concluded in 2010. Dedicated compilations and evaluations of data for charged-particle induced reactions were made available that contributed to the production of important therapeutic radionuclides, namely 64Cu, 67Cu, 67Ga, 86Y, 103Pd, 111In, 114mIn, 124I, 125I, 169Yb, 177Lu, 186Re, 192Ir, 211At, and 225Ac (35 re-
actions were considered) [6].
These data were made available via an IAEA publi- cation and have been assembled in an online repository that is used extensively by the radionuclide production community. However, some of those evaluations require further updating as a consequence of new measurements, while additional emerging radionuclides and correspond- ing production reactions have been identiﬁed as suitable for such attention and assessment [7, 8].
Therefore, a new CRP has been initiated to provide ded- icated evaluations of data for charged-particle induced re- actions divided into three primary categories: beam mon- itor reactions, reactions to produce diagnostic radionu- clides, and reactions to produce therapeutic radionuclides. Sixteen institutions worldwide contributed to these ef- forts, and three meetings were held [9–11]. Cross-section evaluations were supported whenever possible with new measurements. Two research papers have already been published by the IAEA collaboration [12, 13]. Signiﬁcant eﬀort has also been invested in evaluations and new mea- surements of relevant nuclear decay data that will be pub- lished elsewhere.
The current paper is the only one devoted to the evalua- tion of nuclear data of emerging therapeutic radionuclides and to update the data for the production of the important α-emitter 225Ac that was previously evaluated in Ref. [6]. The ten reactions summarized below lead to the produc- tion of 131Cs, 131Ba, 225Ac, 225Ra, 227Th, 227Ac, 230U and 230Pa. Equivalent studies of three reactions to produce 178W as a generator for low-spin 178mTa used in SPECT
diagnostic studies are also included for completeness.
A.Dataset Selection and Fitting Considerations
All available sources of data were considered, and each source was examined rigorously to conﬁrm that beam en- ergies and intensities, target materials, and experimental uncertainties were accurately and fully described. Data selection was made using statistical criteria to exclude in- consistent datasets combined with expert review of mea- sured data. Selected experimental excitation functions were ﬁtted by means of a least-squares method with Pad´e approximants [14–16] - this method of ﬁtting enables esti- mation of the uncertainty [17–19]. Note that current eval- uations are non-model dependent evaluations [20], which are overwhelmingly based on ﬁts to selected experimental data alone (although one or two exceptions are discussed below). For a more detailed discussion of the methodology used to perform the ﬁtting, the reader is referred to our ﬁrst publication in this series [12].
Predicted physical and saturation yields [21] were cal- culated from the evaluated data (Pad´e ﬁt), and are also reported in the relevant subsections below. Where possi- ble and useful, yields for monoisotopic targets have been extrapolated from experiments that used targets of natu- ral isotopic abundance.
Uncertainties in the magnitude of measured cross sec- tion data are reported as given  by  the original authors  of the publications considered, except in rare cases where the uncertainty reported was only statistical in nature and therefore obviously underestimated. The evaluators added a minimum relative systematic uncertainty of 6% in such cases (which was considered to be fully correlated) to  give  the  Pad´e  ﬁtting  algorithm  reasonable  statistical constraints. Energy uncertainties are shown in ﬁgures be- low only when reported by the original authors of the ex- periments in question. The upper and lower uncertainty bounds of the ﬁtted Pad´e approximation are denoted as single-dashed red lines bracketing the solid line that traces the ﬁtted values. More detailed discussions of the deriva- tion of the uncertainty in the recommended data are to be found in Ref. [12]. The experimentally determined ex- citation functions and commensurate Pad´e ﬁts have been compared with the results of theoretical calculations based on the TALYS code, as taken from the TENDL-2017 li- brary [22].
B.Investigations of Therapeutic Radionuclide Production
The reactions summarized in Table 1 have been exam- ined, and nuclear decay data are recommended for each of these reactions in the sections that follow. Several ra- dionuclides of interest can be produced by direct reac- tions and also by production of their radioactive parent, which can subsequently be used as feedstock material. For example, 131Cs is formed by the EC decay of 131Ba which can be produced by proton irradiation of cesium targets via a measurable reaction. Throughout these stud-
ies, adopted nuclear decay data come from ﬁles evaluated and maintained as ENSDF (Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File) under the custodianship of the US National Nuclear Data Center and within the auspices of the Inter- national Network of Nuclear Structure and Decay Data Evaluators [23] unless stated otherwise. Data have been retrieved by means of NuDat [24]. The column deﬁned  as “Principal/Potential Therapeutic Emissions” identiﬁes possible therapeutic emissions from the radionuclides gen- erated by the various charged-particle reactions, including important radionuclides within any of the more substan- tial decay chains. Listed “Decay Data for Production” em- brace a number of disparate requirements: (a) additional details of the decay data of the primary reaction products;
(b) decay data of other signiﬁcant products that arise in the various decay chains; and (c) decay data not already listed that have been and are relevant in analyses that  are or may be required to quantify the desired yields and cross sections of the primary reaction products.
II.PRODUCTION OF 131Cs
The predominant X-ray and Auger-electron emitter 131Cs  (T1/2   =  9.689  d,  100%  EC)  has  been  of  interest as a radioactive source for brachytherapy and stereotac- tic surgery implants since the mid 1960s, with interest increasing especially following the commercialization of reactor-based production methods [25]. Both the half-life and primary X-ray energy of 29 keV are comparable to those of 103Pd, whose commercial production by cyclotron is well established. Furthermore, the slightly higher energy photons emitted by 131Cs are thought to deliver a more uniform dose than 103Pd in certain clinical situations [26]. Accelerator production is possible via several routes, two  of  which  were  evaluated:  direct  production   by the  131Xe(p,n)131Cs  reaction  and  indirect  produc- tion at higher energies via 133Cs(p,3n)131Ba(100% EC
decay)131Cs.
A.	131Xe(p,n)131Cs
Only a single dataset exists that describes the 131Xe(p,n)131Cs reaction [27], covering a proton-beam en- ergy range from threshold to 28 MeV. While additional experimental measurements are required, the agreement between theoretical predictions and the measured data is acceptable. No data were adjusted or rejected, and the available data are well-represented by the Pad´e ﬁt of 11 parameters to the available 27 data points, as shown in Fig. 1. Fitting uncertainties are highest at low energies where the measured energy of the proton beam is most uncertain, but fall to 6% by 10 MeV before rising slowly to 10% above a proton beam energy of 25 MeV. Systematic uncertainty is added as 5% of the ﬁtted values. Physical yields calculated from the ﬁtted function are shown in Fig. 2.

133Cs(p,3n)131Ba(100% EC decay)131Cs
Production of 131Cs is also possible via the ground state isomer of radioactive parent 131Ba (T1/2  = 11.50 d, 100% EC) as a feedstock of carrier-free 131Cs for radiochemical isolation strategies. The same technique is employed in reactor environments, which provides access to 131Ba via the 130Ba(n,γ)131Ba neutron capture reaction.
Available data describing the proton-induced reaction are plotted in Fig. 3(a), and show a threshold energy near 20 MeV with an excitation function peak of approx- imately 1000 mb at an incident proton beam  energy of 30 MeV. The tail of the excitation function approaches  70 mb asymptotically above a  proton  beam  energy  of 70 MeV. Six datasets describe the reaction [29–34]. Only
the dataset from Deptula et al. [30] was rejected due to

an obvious energy shift at low incident proton energies.
An 11-parameter Pad´e ﬁt was chosen to represent the remaining 71 data points plotted in Fig. 3(b) to give a χ2 of 1.64. Physical yields calculated from the ﬁtted excita- tion function are shown in Fig. 4, rising rapidly until the peak has been passed beyond 40 MeV, and then continu- ing to rise with increased proton energy as a consequence of the excitation function remaining close to 100 mb up to 80 MeV.
Although proton irradiation of isotopically enriched 131Xe aﬀords a production route based on globally- distributed, low-energy cyclotrons, the constraints im- posed on accelerators and radiochemistry by enriched gas targets make the 133Cs(p,3n)131Ba more attractive. Ir- radiations of 133Cs have higher yields and employ solid

III.PRODUCTION  OF	Ta
Work on the 178W/178mTa system was omitted  from our recently published paper on gamma emitters [13], and therefore, to ensure completeness, we have highlighted below the clinical use of this particular generator for di- agnostic applications.  The  short-lived (T1/2   = 9.31 min) metastable state of the 178Ta radionuclide can  be used for diagnostic cardiac SPECT imaging, and has limited
potential for future therapeutic applications [35], e.g., in fundamental investigations of microdosimetry.

routes that make use of 178W radioactive parent with a longer half-life (T1/2  = 21.6 d, 100% EC) to aﬀord multiple elutions of 178mTa from radioisotope generators [36, 37]. These multiple elutions make sequential imaging studies
convenient, especially for applications in which repeated assays are required, e.g., quantiﬁcation of ventricular func- tion in preclinical studies [38]. Such studies are impossi- ble with longer lived radioisotopes (e.g., 99mTc) due to radiation-safety concerns.
A.natTa(d,xn)178W
Two complementary datasets were found for the natTa(d,xn)178W reaction [39, 40], and are  shown  in Fig. 5(a). The two experiments disagree at deuteron beam energies around 40 MeV. Data from Bisplinghoﬀ et al. [39]
were  measured after degrading  the  incident beam from
an initial energy of 80 MeV, and therefore this dataset was systematically shifted to lower in energies in order to  match  the  data  from  T´ark´anyi  et al. [40]  (Fig.  5(b)).
No further adjustments were made prior to ﬁtting, which
was accomplished with a 5 parameter Pad´e ﬁt of 20 data points (χ2=0.91).

deuteron beam energy of 50 MeV is in disagreement with the measured data; no obvious physical explanation ex- ists for the local maximum predicted by TALYS modeling at close to 60 MeV, although a possible break-down of deuteron break-up parametrization could be the culprit. Relative uncertainty in the Pad´e ﬁt is 10% except for the lowest two energy points, and a systematic uncertainty of 4% has been added throughout.
Physical yields have been calculated from the recom- mended ﬁt of the excitation function, and are shown in Fig. 6. Since the yield increases with energy at a nearly constant rate throughout the energy range considered and no tungsten radioisotopes with long half-lives exist to reduce the radioisotopic purity of 178W, irradiations at higher incident energy deuterons are favored.
B.nat Ta(p,xn) 178W
There are six known sets of measurements of proton- induced reactions on targets of natTa [41–46]. As shown in Fig. 7(a), these studies describe an excitation func- tion that is very similar in magnitude and energy to the deuteron-induced reaction described above. The single maximum in the excitation function occurs between a proton beam energy of 35 and 40 MeV, which is identiﬁed with the 181Ta(p,4n)178W reaction and possesses a full width half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 15 MeV.
The data from Zaitseva et al. [42] and  Titarenko  et al. [46] have been rejected because of their obvious energy
shifts that make them outliers from all other unmodiﬁed
data. Therefore, the remaining selected 39 data points gave a 12 parameter Pad´e ﬁt with a χ2=1.89. These eval- uated data are compared with TENDL-2017 calculated data and the Pad´e ﬁt in Fig. 7(b). The tail of the excita- tion function declines by an order of magnitude to <100 mb above a proton beam energy of 80 MeV, and no dis- cernible feature can be detected from the 180Ta(p,5n)178W reaction because of the small natural abundance of 180Ta in the tantalum target of only 0.012%.
Uncertainty in the recommended ﬁt includes a system- atic contribution of 5%, and declines from approximately 10% at low energies to a minimum near 50 MeV of 6%, before rising again to 9% at a proton  beam  energy  of 100 MeV. Physical yields have been calculated from the recommended ﬁt of the excitation function, and are shown in Fig. 8.
C.natHf(α,xn)178W
Available data describing alpha-induced reactions that form  178W are  extremely limited.  Only a  single  set   of
measurements has been found in a series of studies by Ta´rka´nyi et al. [40] of the natHf(α,xn)178W reaction that
FIG. 7. (Color online) Evaluated Pad´e ﬁt and TENDL-2017 cal- culated data compared with experimental data from Refs. [41– 46] for the natTa(p,xn)178W reaction.
contains seven data points spanning the alpha-particle beam energy range between 20 and 40 MeV. These mea- sured data appear to rise towards a maximum in the excitation function at approximately 40 MeV beam en- ergy, and result in a 4 parameter Pad´e ﬁt with a χ2=1.40. Contributions of reactions on other hafnium isotopes with mass numbers 176, 177, and 178 are tentatively visible in the structure of the TENDL 2017 data between 20 and   25 MeV, 25 and 30 MeV, and above an alpha-particle beam energy of 30 MeV (see Fig. 9), but the large uncer- tainty and a lack of data mean that the existing experi- mental measurements are unable to verify the theoretical predictions in this regard. The lack of experimental infor- mation on the behavior of the peak within the excitation function causes the uncertainty of the recommended ﬁt to increase rapidly above the ﬁnal data point at a beam energy of 40-MeV, and obviously no recommendations can

be made at higher energies.
Physical  yields  calculated  form  the  Pad´e  ﬁt  are  two orders of magnitude lower than those for proton- or deuteron-induced reactions on tantalum targets (Fig. 10). Such a large yield reduction subjugates consideration of the radiochemical isolation of 178W, especially given that targets of isotopically-enriched hafnium would be desir- able to mitigate against the co-production of long-lived
tantalum radioisotopes as waste (e.g., 182Ta, T1/2  = 114.74 d), making the irradiation of tantalum targets a putatively
superior choice.
reliably into clinical applications.
Besides the charged-particle induced reactions consid- ered below, other less-studied options exist to increase the global stockpile of 229Th (e.g., 232Th(p,x)229Th), or
the use of neutral particle ﬂuxes to form 225Ac  indirectly
(e.g., 226Ra(n,2n)225Ra and 226Ra(γ,n)225Ra), although these reactions are beyond the scope of the present CRP
studies.
The  decay  of  225Ac  leads  to  213Bi  (T1/2   =  45.59  min, 97.80% β−, 2.20% α), and the emission of a single alpha particle following β−-decay to 213Po and α-decay to 209Tl. These alpha-particle emissions have made 213Bi a useful radioactive label for a variety of clinical studies, as well  as stimulating consideration of 225Ac as a generator feed- stock. The cellular lethality of the single alpha-particle emissions is signiﬁcantly lower than the α-decay of 225Ac, which requires larger injected activities for therapeutic ef- fects and higher yields from accelerator eﬀorts to support even pre-clinical research endeavors.
Three reaction routes to 225Ac are considered below, all
by means of proton-induced reactions: direct production via 232Th(p,x)225Ac and 226Ra(p,2n)225Ac, and indirect production via 232Th(p,x)225Ra (100% β− decay) 225Ac. Reactions on targets of 232Th require higher incident en- ergies, and therefore the need to consider more numerous possible side reactions.
A.232Th(p,x)225Ac
The only direct production route to 225Ac that uses a stable target is the 232Th(p,x)225Ac reaction, which has
FIG.  11.   (Color  online)  Evaluated  Pad´e  ﬁt  and  TENDL- 2017 calculated data compared with experimental data from Refs. [51, 52, 54, 56–60] for the 232Th(p,x)225Ac reaction. TENDL-2017 calculated data are scaled in magnitude by the factor shown to enable comparison with the measured data.a threshold at a proton beam  energy  of approximately 40 MeV. This route was ﬁrst explored in the 1950s/1960s with single point measurements by four groups [50–54] mostly at higher energies than those considered in the current evaluation. A total of 12 datasets were found in 10 publications using incident proton energies up to 1.2 GeV, and an additional measurement of thick target yields has been published since we completed our studies [55].
Our evaluation includes only data up to a proton beam energy of 200 MeV, and these are shown in Fig.  11(a) [51, 52, 54, 56–60], omitting all data at higher energies
from Refs. [50, 52, 53, 57]. Data shown include measure- ments by Ermolaev et al. [58] in which the thorium tar- gets  were  so  thick that the  usual assumption  of  a  mo-
noenergetic proton beam was rendered invalid, and there- fore these data from two separate experiments were re- jected. Furthermore, the single data point from Lefort  et
al.  (1960) was judged to be an outlier [52], and was also
rejected. Finally, the dataset of Gauvin [51] was rejected
during the ﬁtting process because of signiﬁcant contradic- tions when compared with the other measured data, and unresolved questions concerning proton-beam intensity monitoring during the experiment.
The 22 selected data points are shown along with an 8 parameter  evaluated  Pad´e  ﬁt  in  Fig.  11(b).  Some  struc- ture in the excitation function is observed between proton beam energies of 40 and 80 MeV that can be attributed to the emission of alpha particles as secondary projectiles. While the selected datasets disagree on the magnitude of this reaction channel at a proton beam energy of approxi- mately 60 MeV, calculated theoretical data from TENDL 2017, as also plotted in Fig. 11(b), predict an excitation function that is more than double the measured values. As a result, the combination of ﬁtted and experimental systematic uncertainties exceeds 10% in the proton beam energy region below 80 MeV, while at higher energies the recommended uncertainty is below 8% in all cases. The relatively small number of datasets with their inconsisten- cies and overall inhomogeneity constitute a strong need for additional experimental measurements. Fitted data were used to calculate the physical yield of the 232Th(p,x)225Ac reaction (Fig. 12), which increases with beam energy over the range of energies studied and suggests higher-energy incident protons for the production of more substantial activities of 225Ac.
B.	226Ra(p,2n)225Ac
Only a single experimental study of the excitation func- tion of the 226Ra(p,2n)225Ac reaction has been performed to date [61]. Use of this reaction is extremely challenging because of the radioactive nature of the precious target metal, whose handling presents far more complex chal- lenges than those faced with stable targets. The ﬁrst daughter of 226Ra is 222Rn, an  inert  and  diﬀusible  gas at standard ambient conditions, leading to hazardous ra- dioactive contamination and requiring atmospheric man-

agement of alpha-emitting radionuclides in environments where the 102 mg targets must be chemically processed and quantitatively recovered between irradiations. Since the previous CRP involved an adequate evaluation of the existing work [6], the current study is primarily an update and revision of the ﬁtting methodology.
The small number of data points available, combined with an unreasonably low and non-physical value mea- sured at a proton beam energy close to 25 MeV, moti- vated us to ﬁt the data shown in Fig. 13 with the addi- tional constraint of including theoretical predictions from TENDL-2017 at proton beam energies above 30 MeV. An 8  parameter  Pad´e  ﬁt  achieves a  χ2=0.02  for  the  5  ex- perimental data points + 3 added theoretical data points. Relative uncertainty in the ﬁtted function is high at above 20% for beam energies below 13 MeV, and between 10 and 20% across the remaining range of energies examined.
Plotted yields point to sub-25 MeV incident energy irra-

diations (Fig. 14), given the diﬃculties in target material handling and recovery, with only moderate gains above the peak of the excitation function beyond a proton beam energy of 20 MeV. A ﬁnal important point of note is that experimental corroboration  of the  cross-section  data of
Apostolidis et al. is most certainly becoming an increas- ingly valuable requirement as the demand for 225Ac grows.
C.	232Th(p,x)225Ra (100% β− decay) 225Ac
As described above, 225Ac can also be produced in- directly by the formation of radioactive 225Ra  parent. This option is particularly interesting for production of radioisotopically pure 225Ac, since direct production by high-energy proton irradiation of 232Th targets leads unavoidably to the co-production of  227Ac  in  quanti- ties that are concerning from a dosimetric perspective (232Th(p,x)227Ac reaction is discussed in detail below in

the context of 227Th production, see Sec. V B).
Only six relevant datasets have been found in ﬁve pa- pers [50, 54, 56, 57, 62], and of these only three con- tained data of interest below a proton beam energy of  200 MeV [54, 57, 62], as shown in Fig. 15(a). Such a lack of cross-section data will most likely have arisen as a con- sequence of the challenge of spectrometric quantiﬁcation of the primary radioactive emissions of 225Ra (30.0% 40 keV γ, 69.5% 316 keV β−, and 30.5% 356 keV β−), which are diﬃcult to detect amid the decay emissions of the various radioactive daughters.
The most reliable means of quantiﬁcation is by logging the more easily-observed gamma rays of 221Fr or 213Bi. These data can then be ﬁtted to Bateman equation mod-els of the decay chain in equilibrium, with parameters that quantify the activities of each radionuclide in the chain. However, this method requires careful HPGe spectrome- try over a period spanning weeks to achieve an adequate
degree of statistical certainty.
Of the datasets evaluated, two contained only data above a proton beam energy of 200 MeV [50, 56], but were  used to  constrain  the  Pad´e  ﬁt  shown  in  Fig.  15(b). However, no recommendations were made above a proton beam energy of 200 MeV because of the overall sparse- ness of the measured data at higher energies. One of the remaining three datasets contained only a single data point [54] and was obviously discrepant from the other measurements, so therefore was rejected (Fig. 15(a)). Al- though the remaining two datasets are only suﬃcient to provide recommendations with high uncertainty that  in-
creases with proton beam energy up to 200 MeV, they are self-consistent [57, 62]. The uncertainties provided by Weidner et al. [57] are purely statistical in nature and un-

derestimate the random contribution to the overall experi-mental uncertaintes. Partly for this reason, the conﬁdence bands associated with the Pad´e 16 ﬁt of the available 19 energy points widen rapidly above a proton beam energy of 100 MeV as seen in Fig. 15(b), suggesting that more experimental measurements at 100 MeV and above are urgently required to improve the deﬁnition of the recom- mended excitation function.
Physical yields calculated from the Pad´e ﬁt are shown in Fig. 16.
V.PRODUCTION OF 227Th
Thorium-227  (T1/2   =  18.697  d,  100%  α)  is  being  ex- plored as a radionuclide for targeted alpha therapy, and also as a parent in generators of daughter 223Ra (T1/2  =
11.43d, 100% α). Radium-223 is employed in chloride
form as the ﬁrst US Food and Drug Administration- approved alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical. Further- more, 227Th can also be obtained from a generator system identiﬁed with the β− decay of longer-lived 227Ac parent (T1/2  = 21.772 y, 98.620% β−, 1.380% α).
Direct 227Th production by charged-particle irradia- tions is limited by the existence of suitable stable target nuclides. The most accessible option is 232Th of the same element as the desired product, which would require mass separation to enable use of 227Th along with undeveloped radiochemical isolation schemes to recover 223Ra from tho- rium solutions containing large amounts of carrier. Unfor- tunately, indirect production of 227Ac with charged par- ticles is challenging because of the need to form large amounts of 227Ac in order to make useful quantities of 227Th available in a timely manner. Furthermore, neutron- initiated reactions and especially the 226Ra(2n,γ) family of reactions can be harnessed by available large neutron ﬂuxes and the relative simplicity of reactor targetry to produce useful quantities of 227Ac from a combination of

multiple neutron captures and β− decays.
A.	232Th(p,x)227Th
Direct production of 227Th by proton irradiation of 232Th requires proton beam energies in excess of 50 MeV. There are nine measurements of this excitation function in eight papers [52, 54, 56–60, 62], as plotted in Fig. 17(a). Clear agreement between ﬁve of these datasets extends above a proton beam energy of 100 MeV [54, 56, 57, 59, 62], while the three measurements from Refs. [52, 58] are in disagreement with all of the other data. As in the pre-
vious studies above, both datasets of Ermolaev et al. [58]

were rejected because thorium targets were used of much larger thicknesses than are usually irradiated in stacked- foil experiments, while the single data point from Lefort
et al. [52] was removed as an outlier due to concerns over the monitor reactions used to quantify the incident proton
ﬂuence.
All selected data are shown in Fig. 17(b) alongside the 7 parameter Pad´e ﬁt and equivalent calculated data from TENDL-2017. The evaluated excitation function peaks at approximately 40 mb between 80 and 90 MeV, before a moderate descent to 25 mb at a proton beam energy of 200 MeV. Relative uncertainties in the ﬁt include a 4% systematic contribution, and range by a factor of as much as two close to the threshold to 7 1% between proton beam energies of 80 and 200 MeV. Physical yields increase monotonically from a proton beam energy of 80 MeV to beyond the energy range considered in these particular studies (see Fig. 18).
B.	232Th(p,x)227Ac (98.62% β− decay) 227Th
Six measured datasets of the excitation function  for the 232Th(p,x)227Ac reaction are described in ﬁve  pa- pers  [51,  54,  55,  58,  63], and these  data  are  shown in
Fig. 19(a). This reaction is important not only as an op- tion for the production of nca (no carrier added) 227Th, but also for consideration of 227Ac radioisotopic impurity
that is unavoidably produced in high-energy proton ir- radiations of 232Th. The measured function in all cases displays structure corresponding to alpha exit channels below a proton beam energy of 70 MeV, but all of the mea- surements disagree on the magnitude and energy location of this type of reaction feature. As a result, the threshold behavior of the excitation has not been accurately quan-
tiﬁed by experiment. The data from Ermolaev et al. [58] have been rejected as described previously. Experiments
conducted by Gauvin [51] involved the use of values for

the 27Al(p,x)24Na and 12C(p,x)11C monitor reactions that disagree by as much as 60% with modern accepted val- ues below 60 MeV and by 10-30% between proton beam energies of 60 and 100 MeV - thus, these data were also rejected.
The remaining selected data from Refs. [54, 63] are shown in Fig. 19(b), along with the data from TENDL 2017  and  the  8  parameter  Pad´e  ﬁt  (χ2=0.67).  Recom- mended uncertainties are below 9% across the range of energies considered, but additional experimental measure- ments are highly recommended to improve the deﬁnition of the excitation function, especially in the vicinity of the reaction threshold where recommend numerical values are
examined on the basis of proton- and deuteron-initiated reactions, as described below. A less eﬃcient route has also been examined that involves the small β− branch of 230Pa  (T1/2   =  17.4  d,  92.2%  EC,  7.8%  β−,  0.0032%  α),
which forms 230U by this limited β− decay process. Never- theless, this route has the distinct advantage of employing natural thorium targets, which are easily accessible.
A.	231Pa(p,2n)230U
Diﬃculties experienced in obtaining and using targets of 231Pa have limited experimental measurements to a sin-
gle publication by Morgenstern et al. [64]. Twenty mea- sured data points from the 231Pa(p,2n)230U reaction have
been ﬁtted with a 5 parameter Pad´e approximation, and are shown together with equivalent data from TENDL 2017 in Fig. 21. EMPIRE [65, 66] theoretical calculations shown in the Morgenstern paper resulted in a much bet- ter description of the data, but required very accurate modelling of the major competing ﬁssion channel [64, 67]. The measured data cover the excitation function from

Uncertainty in the ﬁt is highest near the threshold, where values approach 20% of the excitation function and include a systematic contribution of 5% added throughout these cross-section
data. At higher proton beam energies, the uncertainty
does not exceed 10%, with a minimum of approximately 8% at a proton beam energy of approximately 20 MeV.
Physical yields calculated from the Pad´e ﬁt are shown in Fig. 22, rising from the excitation function threshold to over 0.35 MBq·μAh−1 at a proton energy of 25 MeV.
FIG. 23. Evaluated data from [68] compared with Pad´e ﬁt and TENDL-2017 data up to 25 MeV. Upper and lower uncertainty bounds of the recommended data are denoted by single-dashed lines.
231Pa(d,3n)230U
The deuteron-initiated 231Pa(d,3n)230U reaction has only been measured by Morgenstern et al. [68] between threshold and a deuteron beam energy of 20 MeV. The re-
sulting excitation function is of slightly smaller magnitude and greater peak width than the (p,2n) reaction described above. These eleven measured data points were ﬁtted to an 8 parameter Pad´e approximation (χ2=0.170), as shown in Fig. 23 along with calculated data from TENDL-2017. The theoretical model overestimates the magnitude of the excitation function signiﬁcantly, and underestimates the peak energy by approximately 3 MeV. Similar prob- lems were noted with respect to the theoretical modelling
presented in the original paper that used the EMPIRE re-FIG. 24. (Color online) Physical yields calculated from Pad´e ﬁt of selected data for the 231Pa(d,3n)230U reaction.
action model code [65, 66]. These problems are identiﬁed
with deﬁciencies in describing the elastic and especially
the inelastic break-up that dominate the deuteron reac-tion cross section at beam energies comparable with the Coulomb barrier (estimated at about 20 MeV for p+231Pa
system).
Uncertainty in the Pad´e ﬁt is dominated by systematic
contributions of 5% that are a consequence of the smooth
progression of the measured data points across the energy
range explored. Physical yields have been calculated from
the  ﬁt, and are  shown  in  Fig.  24  to rise monotonically
from threshold to a maximum of 0.25 MBq μAh−1 at a
deuteron beam energy of 25 MeV.

FIG. 26. (Color online) Physical yields calculated from Pad´e ﬁt of selected data for the 232Th(p,3n)230Pa reaction.
232Th(p,3n)230Pa (7.80% β− decay) 230U
Because of the greater relative accessibility of 232Th targets (as compared with 231Pa), more data are available to describe the 232Th(p,3n)230Pa reaction than for the 231Pa(d,3n)230U and 231Pa(p,2n)230U reactions. Eleven datasets dating from 1955 onwards have been assembled to quantify this excitation function up to a proton beam  energy of 200 MeV, as shown in Fig. 25(a) [54, 69–77]. Six of these datasets were rejected during the evaluation: Chu and Zhou ([76], inaccurate monitor reactions), Brun and Simonoﬀ ([77], obvious outliers), Lefort et al. ([54], an obvious outlier), Meinke et al. ([70], both datasets exhibit energy oﬀsets of approximately 50-MeV and signiﬁcant
outliers), and Tewes ([69], obvious outliers). All of the remaining 39 data points from Refs. [71–75] are plotted in Fig. 25(b), along with the equivalent calculated data from TENDL-2017 and the 9 parameter Pad´e ﬁt (χ2=1.46).
The TENDL data overestimate the magnitude of the excitation function by a factor of two, although the main features are located correctly. Theoretical modelling of this reaction is a signiﬁcant challenge because of  the need for an accurate ﬁssion model as a dominant decay channel [75]. Nevertheless, a very accurate description of the measured and recommended cross-section data was achieved in Ref. [75] through their adoption of the EM-PIRE  code  [65,  66].  Uncertainties  in  the  Pad´e  ﬁt  range from 9-11% below a proton-beam energy of 17 MeV, and decrease to 7% at higher proton  beam  energies  up  to 30 MeV.
Calculated physical yields from the Pad´e ﬁt are more than a factor of 20 higher than yields from proton- and deuteron-induced reactions on 231Pa targets, reaching a maximum of 8 MBq μAh−1 just above a  proton  energy of 30 MeV. This higher yield mitigates against the small branching ratio of 230Pa β− decay to the desired 230U, which in conjunction with the simplicity of a target of natural abundance that does not constitute special nu- clear material makes the 232Th(p,3n)230Pa route a very attractive option when compared with direct reactions for production.
VII.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
These studies of the cross-section data for speciﬁc ther- apeutic radionuclides represent the ﬁnal set of excitation functions recommended for assessment and evaluation within an IAEA Coordinated Research Project on Nuclear Data for Charged-particle Monitor Reactions and Medi- cal Isotope Production, 2012 to 2017/18. This multina- tional collaborative eﬀort galvanized nuclear cross-section research activities between 2013 and 2017 on the pro- duction of a variety of positron-, gamma-, electron-, and alpha-emitting radionuclides. The organization of such a program of work catalyzed comprehensive technical dis- cussions of the experimental and theoretical challenges in such measurements, theoretical modelling and evalua- tions, and incited the development of an updated set of nuclear reaction and decay data. In particular, the rec- ommended reaction data are notable for the inclusion of uncertainties, which are expected to be broadly useful to researchers and communities seeking to standardize their own measurement programs and undertake strategic ex- perimental studies of additional required data. As desired and speciﬁed at the beginning of this  work, the  eﬀorts  of the CRP have built substantially on IAEA Technical Reports Series no. 473 published almost eight years ear- lier [6].
The inclusion of data on the production of therapeutic
radionuclides portends towards increasing medical interest in deﬁning and adopting physically unstable nuclides as targeted vectors for the treatment of human diseases. As discussed frequently in this work, successful application of charged-particle beams to the production of therapeutic radionuclides relies heavily on a balanced consideration of the nuclear data to inform yield and purity predictions which will directly inﬂuence the achievable scale of clinical trials and patient dosimetry. The data and uncertainties recommended here not only serve to guide the develop- ment of infrastructure which will address global supply deﬁciencies of these radionuclides, but also to motivate additional studies of particular nuclear reactions whereby the existing data are obviously inadequate and insuﬃ- ciently accurate or precise.
More work is needed in many areas, including several reactions evaluated in the current project that were shown to involve only a single experimental measurement. The 226Ra(p,2n)225Ac reaction in particular, as well as reac-
tions to produce 227Th, are in need of new measurements whose signiﬁcance will grow as more successful treatments of previously refractory diseases are reported. Nuclear re- action characterization and decay data evaluations are both becoming increasingly important for Auger- and low-energy electron-emitting radionuclides such as 119Sb, 103Pd, and 135La, while new theranostic imaging surro- gates are being explored for alpha-emitting radionuclides (large ionic radii typical of actinide elements create dif- ﬁculties for established positron-emitting nuclides to act as chemically identical congeners in low molecular weight targeting vectors that have shown such promise for the treatment of disease).
The careful measurement of thick target yields provides much needed validation of evaluations like the ones pre- sented, and these data are urgently sought to conﬁrm our recommendations and the data measured independently by the sources we have considered. We will also need to contemplate the production of therapeutic radionuclides by means of higher mass projectile bombardments – reac-
tions which use beams of ionic lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, etc., often have excitation functions with maxima at the hundred-millibarn level with the potential
to produce Gigabecquerel quantities for clinical applica- tions, e.g., 149Tb.
