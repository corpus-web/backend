1. Introduction
Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have widespread applications in portable electronics technology and electric vehicles [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. However, the commonly used graphite anode in LIBs suffers from low capacity (372 mA h g−1) and bad rate performance, thus serious restraining its large-scale applications [5,6]. Up to date, tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring environmentally friendly and inexpensive electrode materials with outstanding rate capability, high reversible capacity and cycle stability for advanced LIBs [7,8]. Transition metal oxides especially NiO, Fe3O4, MnO2, SnO2 and ZnO have been developed as promising anode materials for LIBs owning to their high theoretical capacities [4,9]. Among, ZnO exhibits a large theoretical lithium storage capacity up to 987 mA h g−1, a high lithium-ion diffusion coefficient but low production cost, making it a promising anode material candidate for LIBs [10,11]. Nevertheless, its poor conductivity, serious volume expansion (228%) and crystal aggregation in repetitive charge/discharge cycles leading to low rate performance and poor cycle life [12].
To address these issues, an effective strategy is to couple ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with carbonaceous materials such as graphene as electrode materials due to its superior electronic conductivity and high specific surface area [13]. By using sol-gel method, Zhang et al. recently prepared ZnO/graphene composite, which showed enhanced discharge capacity and cycling stability in comparison to pristine ZnO [14]. However, the composite lacks ionic channels for fast mass transport, and has difficult to effectively accommodate the volume expansion and contraction of ZnO NPs in repetitive charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment used in the synthetic process makes it hard to achieve large-scale production. Nevertheless, it is of urgent to improve the rate capability, reversible capacity and cycling stability of the graphene-ZnO composites to meet the practical application for LIBs.
Herein, zinc oxide nanoparticles embedded holey reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/H-rGO) nanocomposite was designed and successfully prepared using a facile and eco-friendly in-situ etching strategy (Fig. 1). Zn2+ was firstly uniformly dispersed on the GO surface owning to their electrostatic interaction. After freeze-drying, the obtained composite was thermal annealed at 700 °C under the protection of high-purity argon. During the calcination process, the Zn-based precursors was decomposed into ZnO NPs, which could work as an etching agent to oxidize their neighboring carbon atoms on rGO sheet generating holes. It is worthy of a note that the etching process will not happen at the thermal treatment temperature of 600 °C. The nanocomposites of rGO supported ZnO NPs (ZnO/rGO) and ZnO NPs embedded highly etched rGO (ZnO/H-rGO-1) were prepared as control samples under different thermal treatment temperatures. In comparison to ZnO/rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1, it was found that the prepared ZnO/H-rGO showed excellent electrochemical properties such as higher rate capability, larger discharge capacity as well as great cycling stability, demonstrating a less expensive but high-performance anode of ZnO/H-rGO for LIBs.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of ZnO/H-rGO
Graphene oxide (GO) used in this work was prepared by the modified Hummer's approach [[15], [16], [17]]. First of all, 0.1 g GO and 6.0 mL ethanol were added into 14.0 mL deionized water, followed by the obtained mixture of GO solution was treated with ultrasonication for 30.0 min. Then, 197.8 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved into 5.0 mL deionized water under ultrasonication for 5.0 min. The resultant solution was transferred into above GO solution and stirred for 10.0 min, and the pH value of above mixed solution was adjusted to 8–9 using ammonium hydroxide. After further stirring for about 60.0 min, the finally obtained solution was dried by lyophilization, and then thermally treated at 700 °C under high-purity argon atmosphere for 0.5 h. The prepared GO solution was firstly freeze-dried, followed by thermal treatment at 700 °C under high-purity argon atmosphere for 0.5 h, and the final obtained samples were named as rGO (Fig.S1). The composites of ZnO/rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1 were prepared with the similar synthetic procedures to ZnO/H-rGO except that the thermal treatment temperatures respectively were 600 °C and 800 °C instead of 700 °C.
2.2. Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was measured using Mettler Toledo TGA-2 under air conditions. X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV), Raman microscope (DPSS laser, 50 mW), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI-5000), scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7800F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100 Plus) were used to characterize the morphology and crystal structure of prepared samples. Specific surface areas of samples were analyzed from the results of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (ASIQMU00U11–6) using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution of ZnO/H-rGO was analyzed with Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical performance of electrode materials was evaluated with a CR2016 coin-type half-cell using Celgard 2400 as separator, and a lithium foil as counter and reference electrode. The ZnO/H-rGO electrode was prepared by mixing ZnO/H-rGO powder, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Solvay S.A.) with a mass ratio of 8: 1: 1 in solvent N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, Aldrich). The obtained slurry was then coated on a copper foil and dried at 110 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven, following by cutting into several disks with the diameter of 10 mm as working electrodes. To prepared electrolyte, 1.0 M LiPF6 solution was dissolved into the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene methyl carbonate (EMC) with the volume ratio 1: 1: 1. The charge/discharge capacities and the cycle stability of assembled LIBs were measured using Neware battery testing system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of assembled LIBs were tested with electrochemical workstation CHI760E (Shanghai, ChenHua).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Nanostructure and morphology
For the composite Zn(NO3)2 and GO (Zn(NO3)2/GO), its EDS mapping images in Fig. 2a display uniform distribution of C, N and Zn elements on the surface of GO. Then the Zn(NO3)2/GO composite was thermal treated at 700 °C for 0.5 h, and XPS technique was carried out to identify the chemical status and compositions of obtained solid product (Fig. 2b-c). For Zn 2p, the two characteristic peaks at the binding energies of 1045.1 and 1022.2 eV correspond to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 spin orbits of ZnO phase, respectively [18,19]. While the three peaks of C1s at the binding energies of 284.6, 285.6, and 288.8 eV are assigned to the highly delocalized sp2-hybridized Csingle bondC, Csingle bondO and Cdouble bondO groups, respectively. It is noteworthy that the small fraction of Csingle bondO and Cdouble bondO groups contributed to C1s indicates that GO is significantly reduced to rGO [20]. XRD patterns of ZnO/H-rGO, rGO and GO were recorded and shown in Fig. 2d. The diffraction peaks of ZnO/H-rGO at 31.77°, 34.42°, 36.25°, 47.54°, 56.60°, 62.86° and 67.96° respectively correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) facets, which are consistent well to ZnO (JCPDS No. 36–1451). GO exhibits a sharp characteristic diffraction peak at 9.4°. While the peak position shifts to 26.1° when the GO changed into rGO. The peak value of rGO is very close to that of graphite (26.5°), suggesting the serious restacking of rGO layers [21,22]. Importantly, ZnO/H-rGO shows a little more negative diffraction peak position at around 25.3° in comparison to that of rGO. Thus, it is believed that the rGO restacking of ZnO/H-rGO could be highly suppressed owning to the embedded ZnO NPs [4,23].

SEM image in Fig. 3a depicts the ZnO NPs with an average size of 20 nm uniformly dispersed on rGO surface, and individual ZnO NP is located around one etched hole (Fig. 3b, the obtained sample was named as ZnO/H-rGO), which is further confirmed by the TEM image in Fig. 3c. The SEM image in Fig. 3d shows that the ZnO NP is embedded in holey rGO, demonstrating the high contact between ZnO NPs and etched holey rGO. The clear lattice fringes in Fig. 3d (inset) demonstrate high crystallinity of the ZnO NP. The lattice spacing of 0.257 nm could be indexed to (002) facets (JCPDS NO. 36–1451). The specific surface area of ZnO/H-rGO is as high as 812.3 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3e), which has great advantages in comparison to reported ZnO/graphene-based materials such as ZnO/GO (234.1 m2 g−1) [24], graphene/ZnO (58.9 m2 g−1) [25], and ZnO-rGO (23.7 m2 g−1) [26]. The pore size distribution features mesopores with a diameter of around 4 and 20 nm, concurring with the SEM characterizations in Fig. 2a-b. For ZnO/H-rGO, the rich holes in rGO sheets is believed to effectively reduce electrolyte diffusion distance, enhance cycling stability and provide more Li ion storage sites for advanced LIBs [[27], [28], [29]]. The ZnO loading in ZnO/H-rGO is around 44.96 wt% as determined by TGA analysis (Fig. 3f).

In order to clarify the key factors affecting the formation of ZnO NPs and corresponding holes in rGO, two control samples of ZnO/rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1 are also prepared at 600 °C (0.5 h) and 800 °C (0.5 h), respectively. Fig. 4a illustrates that ZnO/rGO, ZnO/H-rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1 exhibit the characteristic XRD diffraction peaks of ZnO and rGO, indicating that Zn(NO3)2 can be decomposed into ZnO over 600 °C. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 4b, all the three samples show two distinct characteristic bands, the D band at about 1355 cm−1 and the G band at about 1600 cm−1. The G band is a characteristic peak of graphite E2g, which depends on the vibration of the sp2 bond in the two-dimensional graphite hexagonal crystal. The height of the D band indicates the shortcoming and confusion of the hexagonal graphite layer [[30], [31], [32]]. Theoretically, the peak intensity ratio between D band and G band (ID/IG) reflects the type of the graphitic materials and the degree of graphitization of carbon-based materials [33,34]. For ZnO/H-rGO, its calculated ID/IG value (1.00) is higher than that of ZnO/rGO (0.92) but lower than that of ZnO/H-rGO-1 (1.17), implying a drop in the sp2 domains upon reduction and strong interaction between ZnO and rGO sheets with the increase treatment temperature [7,35]. Fig. 4c shows the ZnO NPs in ZnO/rGO uniformly dispersed on rGO surface while no well-defined holes can be found in rGO. As calcination temperature increased to 700 °C, one can clearly observe that large number of holes, and individual ZnO NP is located around one etched hole in rGO (Fig. 4d). When the calcination temperature increases to 800 °C, rGO sheets are highly etched by the aggregated ZnO NPs (average size over 50 nm, Fig. 4e). These results clearly confirm that the thermal treatment temperature is one key factor to producing small-sized ZnO NPs and uniformly distributed holes in rGO. The produced ZnO NPs can function as etching agent to oxidize their neighboring carbon atoms on rGO sheet at certain high temperature, thus achieving in situ etched holes around the ZnO NPs [36]. In order to get further insights of the etching mechanism of ZnO NPs, the nanocomposite of ZnO/Graphene was also prepared with the identical conditions in the synthesis of ZnO/H-rGO except for 0.05 g graphene (received from Sinocarbon Materials Technology Co., Ltd., China) instead of 0.1 g GO. Its SEM image in Fig. 4f only shows a few etched holes in graphene. This result suggests that appropriate etching temperature and oxygen-containing groups on graphene surface are essential factors to oxidize carbon atoms forming uniform holes.

3.2. Electrochemical performance
CV curves of ZnO/H-rGO composite in the initial six cycles were firstly studied (Fig. 5a). For the first cathodic scan, the strong peak at around 0.36 V could be related to the reduction of ZnO to Zn, the formation of LiZn alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film [37]. Previously literatures reported that the formation of the SEI film usually occurs during the initial discharge process, which could be originated from the instability of the interface between electrode materials and electrolyte, especially for low-voltage anode systems (such as carbonaceous materials) [[38], [39], [40]]. As far as we know, the ZnO/H-rGO has a lower cathodic peak potential as compared to that of previously reported ZnO/graphene composites, indicating high kinetics of Li insertion for ZnO/H-rGO, which could be contributed to the unique holes in rGO sheets providing effective channels for fast mass transport [[41], [42], [43], [44]]. For the first anodic scan, the peaks at 0.21, 0.51, 0.66 and 1.34 V are attributed to the multi-step dealloying process of Lisingle bondZn alloy [10], while the peak at 2.56 V corresponds to the oxidation of Zn to ZnO [38]. The peak at around 0.88 V in the second cathodic scan could be due to the formation of Lisingle bondZn alloy and the reduction of ZnO to Zn [45]. The curves almost overlap in the subsequent cycles, indicating high reversibility and cycling capacity of ZnO/H-rGO. Its redox reaction between Li ions and ZnO can be illustrated in the following two steps: ZnO + 2Li → Zn + Li2O and Zn + Li → LiZn [12]. Fig. 5b shows the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of ZnO/H-rGO at different cycles. A long voltage plateau at around 0.45 V in the first discharge curve could be ascribed to the reduction of Zn2+ to Zn0, the formation of LiZn alloy and SEI film [46]. A voltage plateau at around 1.30 V in the first charge curve corresponds to the oxidation reaction of Zn with Li2O. These results match well with the CV analysis as in Fig. 5a. The specific capacities in the first discharge and charge cycle of ZnO/H-rGO are 1636 and 999 mA h g−1, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency of 61%, which could be related to the formation of SEI film [47,48].

The rate capabilities of ZnO/rGO, ZnO/H-rGO, ZnO/H-rGO-1 were investigated and compared at various current densities from 0.1 to 10.0 A g−1 (Fig. 5c). Obviously, the average discharge capacities of ZnO/H-rGO are 867, 634, 548, 374 and 300 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. As a comparison, the corresponding average discharge capacities of ZnO/rGO are 677, 428, 364, 276 and 229 mA h g−1, and those of ZnO/H-rGO-1 are 739, 440, 369, 259 and 203 mA h g−1, respectively. It is worthy of being noted that ZnO/H-rGO still possesses a high discharge capacity up to 300 mA h g−1 at the current density of 10.0 A g−1, demonstrating its superior rate capability. When the current density of ZnO/H-rGO returns to 0.1 A g−1, its discharge capacity increases to 715 mA h g−1. While those of ZnO/rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1 are merely 477 and 515 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the ZnO/H-rGO electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 607 mA h g−1 when the current density is reverted to 1.0 A g−1, which is much higher than those of ZnO/rGO (382 mA h g−1) and ZnO/H-rGO-1 (356 mA h g−1) and its original value 548 mA h g−1. These results confirm that ZnO/H-rGO has the highest rate capability comparing with the two controlled samples of ZnO/rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1. Additionally, ZnO/H-rGO electrode maintains a high discharge capacity up to 695 mA h g−1 even after subsequent 500 cycles, demonstrating its long cycling stability (Fig. 5d).
Fig. 5e shows the cycling stabilities of ZnO/rGO, ZnO/H-rGO and ZnO/H-rGO-1 electrodes at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Obviously, the reversible capacity of the above three electrodes decreases rapidly in the first 20 cycles. While in the subsequent cycles, they start to increase and finally maintain stable values with the gradual activation of electrode materials. For ZnO/H-rGO, its discharge capacity could be well maintained at around 942 mA h g−1 even after 400 cycles, which is much higher than those of ZnO/rGO (606 mA h g−1) and ZnO/H-rGO-1 (442 mA h g−1), respectively, confirming great cycling stability and high discharge capacity of ZnO/H-rGO. Meanwhile, its calculated Coulombic efficiency is nearly 100%, further confirming the superior reversibility of ZnO/H-rGO. Table 1 compares the electrochemical performance of various ZnO-graphene hybrids, pointing to the highest reversible capacity and best cycling stability of the prepared ZnO/H-rGO in this work.

3.3. Enhancement mechanism discussion
The mechanism of performance enhancement for prepared ZnO/H-rGO composite was proposed and discussed as in Fig. 6. Firstly, the support rGO has high conductivity, which is benefit to provide favorable electron transfer. Secondly, the etched large number of holes in rGO sheets would offer effective channels to reduce electrolyte diffusion distance for high rate capability. While the ZnO NPs embedded in etched holes on rGO sheets are highly favorable to accommodate their volume expansion and contraction during repetitive charge/discharge cycles, resulting in high cycling performance. Additionally, the XPS spectrum of O1s in Fig. 6 (inset) exhibits a strong peak at 531.1 eV, indicating the existence of rich C-O-Zn bonds [11], which could be related to the holey rGO sheets etched by ZnO NPs under high treatment temperature. The rich C-O-Zn bonds in ZnO/H-rGO composite implies a strong interaction between ZnO NPs and contacted holey rGO sheet, which might also display important roles in enhancing the cycling performance of ZnO/H-rGO. Finally, the optimally sized holes in rGO sheets and embedded small-sized ZnO NPs act together to provide more Li ion storage sites thus achieving high reversible capacity. Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent electrochemical performance of the ZnO/H-rGO composite is mainly attributed to the delicate interaction between the embedded ZnO NPs and in situ etched holey rGO framework.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported ZnO NPs embedded holey rGO nanocomposite with a facile and eco-friendly in situ etching strategy. The holes in rGO could be well controlled through adjusting the etching temperature. We found that both appropriate etching temperature and oxygen-containing functional groups on rGO sheets display critical roles in forming uniform holey rGO. When used as an anode for LIBs, the prepared ZnO/H-rGO electrode exhibits discharge and charge specific capacities of 1636 and 999 mA h g−1, respectively, with high rate capability and cycling stability (discharge capacity of 942 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 400 cycles and even 695 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 500 cycles). The well-designed architecture of the ZnO/H-rGO composite is demonstrated to provide rich holes in rGO allowing effective mass transport, offer more Li ion storage sites and alleviate the volume expansion and contraction of the electrode during the cycling process, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. The facile in situ etching strategy proposed in this work can be easily extended to synthesize other metal oxide/H-rGO composites as advanced electrode materials for LIBs and beyond.
