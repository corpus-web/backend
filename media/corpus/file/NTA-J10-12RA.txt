Resonance energies and total natural width of  the 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° Rydberg series of Mg-like       (Z 13–26) ions are reported. Resonance energies of the Mg-like Alþ belonging to the 3pns 3P
°-2p63p2P0    and 3pns 3P°-2p63p2P0    transitions are also tabulated. The calculations are made in the framework of the Screening constant by unit nuclear charge (SCUNC) formalism. Excellent agreements between experiments at ALS and R-matrix calculations are obtained for both 3pns 1,3P° and 3pnd 1P° Rydberg series of the Mg-like Alþ ions. The present results for Mg-like Si2þ, S4þ, Cl5þ, and Ar6þ, compared with the only existing R-matrix calculations indicate lack of accuracy in the Mg-like Si2þ data obtained from noniterative formulation of the eigenchannel R-matrix method. New precise data for Mg- like P3þ, K7þ, Ca8þ, Sc9 þ, Ti10þ, V11þ, Cr12þ, Mn13þ, and  Fe14þ  ions  are  presented  as  useful  guidelines for investigators focusing their challenge on the Photoionization of Mg-like heavy charged ions in con- nection with their application in laboratory, astrophysics, and plasma physics.

1.Introduction
Photoionization study on atoms and ions is of great interest for understanding astrophysics, and laboratory atomic spectra. As stated by Doschek and Feldman, (1987), Photoionization of Mg and Mg-isoelectronic sequence are important for modeling of astro- physical plasma surrounded by hot radiation sources such as the Sun and stellar transition regions. Over the past decades, numer- ous investigations have been performed to report resonances en- ergy and natural widths from photoionization studies on Mg-like ion. From B-spline-based conﬁguration-interaction (BSCI) calcula- tions, Fang et al., (1997), presented a quantitative study of the resonant structures of the overlapping 3pnd 1F and 3png 1F autoionization series in the photoionization from the bound excited 1D states of Mg-like Alþ and Si2þ ions. Relativistic and resonance effects in the photoionization of Mg-like Fe XV are in- vestigated by Haque and Pradhan, (1999) using the Breit-Pauli R- matrix method. In addition, West et al., (2001), investigated the photoionization cross sections of Alþ ions combining absolute measurements utilizing a merged-photon–ion-beam setup with synchrotron radiation from an undulator and multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method and then reported resonant para- meters  belonging  to  several  conﬁgurations  such  as  the  3pns  P°
series. From high-resolution measurements at the ALS and  from R-matrix calculations, Hudson et al. (2005), reported energy posi- tions of the 3pns 3P°, 3pns 1P°, and 3pnd 1P° series of Alþ. Non- iterative formulation of the eigenchannel R-matrix method has  been  applied  by  Kim  and  Koike  (2008)  to  study  resonant para-
meters belonging to the 3pns 1P° and a 3pnd 1P° series of the Mg-like Si2þ ions. Using the multiconﬁguration relativistic random phase approximation theory, Hsiao and Huang (2011) investigated the valence-shell photoionization of the Mg-like Alþ, Si2þ, P3þ,S4þ, Cl5þ, and Ar6þ ions. Besides, Kim and Kwon (2013) calculatedpartial and total photoionization cross sections of the Mg-like S4þ ion using a noniterative eigenchannel R-matrix method combined with multichannel quantum-defect theory at the R-matrix surface. In addition, Kim and Kwon (2013) extended these preceding works for the Mg-isoelectronic S4þ ions to the Mg-isoelectronic Cl5þ and Ar6þ ions. For the 3pns 3P°, 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° series, scarce literature data exist as far as we know except for those of the Mg-like Si2þ( Kim and Koike, 2008), S4þ (Kim and Kwon, 2013), Cl6þ  and Ar7þ (Kim and Kwon, 2015) ions. The goal of the present work is twofold. Firstly, we aim to report accurate data to be compared with the only ﬁrst R-matrix computations (Kim and Koike, 2008; Hsiao and Huang, 2011; Kim and Kwon, 2013, 2015) to enlighten credit in these ﬁrst R-matrix calculations. Secondly, Mg-isoelec- tronic series being crucial for modeling astrophysical plasma, we intend also to tabulated precise new data belonging to the Mg-like P3þ, K7þ, Ca8þ, Sc9þ, Ti10þ, V11þ, Cr12þ, Mn13þ and Fe14þ ions. In this purpose, we use the Screening constant by unit nuclear charge (SCUNC) method (Sakho et al., 2015a, 2015b, Sakho, 2016; Arun et al., 2016). The layout of the present paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present a brief outline of the theoretical part of the work. The presentation and the discussion of the results obtained are given in Section 3 where comparisons are made with some literature  data.  In   Section   4,  we  summarize   and conclude  our study.
2.Theory
2.1.Brief description of the SCUNC formalism
In the framework of the SCUNC formalism, the resonance en-ergy of  a  given Rydberg  series  originating  from a  -2Sþ1LJ state, is given by (Sakho et al., 2015a, 2015b, Sakho, 2016; Arun et al., 2016).
@1
The β(Z, 2S+1LJ, n, s, μ, ν)-parameters are screening constants by unit nuclear charge expanded in inverse powers of Z and given by where fk = fk (2S+1LJ, n, s, μ, ν) are screening constants to be evaluated empirically.
So Eq. (1) is in the general form
@3
In Eq. (2), En denotes the resonance energy, Z stands for the atomic number, E1 is the energy value of the series limit, ν and m (m4ν)  are  the  principal  quantum  numbers  of   the  (2Sþ1LJ)  nl Rydberg series used to evaluate empirically the fk–screening constants, s  represents the spin of the nl  – electron (s ¼½) and q
stands    for    the    number   of    terms   in    the   expansion    of the β(Z, 2S+1LJ, n, s, μ, ν)–parameter.     Generally,     precise   resonance energies are obtained for q o5.
In general, resonance energies are analyzed from the standard quantum-defect expansion formula
@3
In this equation, R is the Rydberg constant, E denotes the converging limit, Z core represents the electric charge of the core ion, and δ means the quantum defect. In addition, theoretical and measured energy positions can be analyzed by calculating the Z*- effective charge in the framework of the SCUNC-procedure
@4
In this equation,
@
The relationship between Z* and δ is then in the form using  Eqs. (3) and (4)
@5
According to this equation, each Rydberg series must satisfy the following conditions
@6
Besides, the f2-parameter in Eq. (2) can be theoretically de- termined from the equation
@7
We get then f2¼ Z – Zcore, where Zcore is directly obtain by the photoionization process from an atomic Xp þ system
@
We ﬁnd then Zcore¼ p þ1.
2.2.Resonance energies and widths
The resonance energies for the 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° series of the investigated Mg-like ions are given by (in Rydberg units)
●for the 3pns 1P° series
@8
●for the 3pnd 1P° series
@9
●for the 3pns 3P° series of Alþ
@10
The fk (l; 1,3P°) -screening constants in Eqs. (8)–(10) are evaluated using the experimental measurements on Alþ from the work of Hudson et al. (2005). The experimental energy positions are presented in terms of the free-electron energy in Rydberg as follows. For these series (ν 5) and (μ 6)
for the 3pns 1P° series: E (3p5s 1P°) 0.2059 Ryd; E (3p6s 1P°) 0.3128 Ryd
for the 3pnd 1P° series: E (3p5d 1P°) 0.3401 Ryd; E (3p6d 1P
°) 0.3846 Ryd
for the 3pns 3P° series: E (3p5s 3P°) 0.2117 Ryd; E (3p6s 1P°) 0.3197 Ryd
These energies are measured with respect to the 3p 2P° LS limit at 0.49075 Ryd. In addition, the experimental data in terms of photon energy (eV) have been converted to free electron energies (Ryd) using the ionization potential of Alþ at 18.83 eV (Hudson et al., 2005). For energy conversion we use 1 Ryd  ¼ 13.60569 eV.(with Z0¼ 13).
●for the 3pns 1P° series: f1(s; 1P°)¼— 2.7498; f2 (s; 1P°)¼ 11.0189.
●for the 3pnd 1P° series: f1(d; 1P°)¼ 0.2770; f2 (d; 1P°)¼ 10.9899.
●for the 3pns 3P° series: f1(s; 3P°)¼— 3.2004; f2 (s; 3P°)¼ 11.1587.
As far as widths are concerned, calculations are made from the following formula
@11
The f1(l, 1P°)-screening constants in Eq. (11) are determined from the experimental work on Mg (Z0 12) (Wehlitz et al., 2007) and calculated for each level. For example, for the 3pns 1P° series, we ﬁnd from Wehlitz et al., (2007) (in meV) Γ(3p5s 1P°)¼ 102.6 and Γ (3p6s 1P°)¼ 42.5. Using these data, Eq. (11) provides f1(s; 1P
°)¼— 1.977 and f2(s; 1P°)¼ 12.060.
3.Results and discussion
3.1.Energy positions from the 3p 2P° LS limit
In the experimental work of Hudson et al., (2005), no ﬁne- structure splitting was apparent for the two series 3pnd 1P° and 3pns 1P° observed in the near threshold region. Although these series may exhibit ﬁne-structure splitting, we disregard the split- ting of the 2P° term by averaging the energy limits as ∑ gJEJ/ ∑ gJ ,where gJ
denotes the statistical weight for J state. This gives 0.49075 Ryd for Alþ — 3p 2P° limit. The results obtained in this work from Eqs. (8)–(11) are listed in Tables 1–11. Table 5 catalogs the energy positions and quantum defects in terms of the free- electron energy of the 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° resonance series of Alþ. Comparison is done with the high-resolution measurements  at the ALS and with the R-matrix calculations of Hudson et al. (2005). The agreement is excellent for both 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° series. It  should be underlined that the SCUNC formulas (8) and (9) reproduce excellently the experimental data up to n ¼ 13. In addition, it can be seen that the SCUNC formalism provides the- oretical data matching more with the experimental measurements than the relativistic R-matrix approach. This is the natural beha-vior of the SCUNC analytical formulas incorporating relativistic and electron-electron effects via the screening parameters eval- uated using experimental data. Table 6 shows a comparison of the energy positions of the LS 3pns 3P° series of Alþ from the ex- perimental and theoretical R-matrix calculations of Hudson et al.,(2005) in the both sides of preliminary LS calculations and re- lativistic calculations. The experimental data in terms of photon energy (eV) have been converted to free-electron energies (Ryd) using the ionization potential at 18.83 eV and the ﬁne-structure have been combined using the appropriate statistical weights. Here again, it is seen that the analytical SCUNC expression (10) reproduces very well the experimental data. The differences be- tween the SCUNC predictions and the experimental measure- ments are less than 0.0008 Ryd for all the resonances tabulated. In Table 7 are quoted the present SCUNC results for resonance en- ergy, effective quantum number, effective nuclear charge, quan- tum defect and width of the 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° series of the Mg-like Si2þ ions. Comparison is done with the only noniterative

formulation of the eigenchannel R-matrix (NIFER) calculations of Kim and Koike (2008). If the  agreement  between the calculations  is good for the 3pnd 1P° series, discrepancies are observed as far as
the 3pns 1P° resonances are concerned. This is particular apparent for the two ﬁrst entries 3p5s 1P° and 3p6s 1P° where the SCUNC predictions for energy positions are respectively at 34.459 eV and

37.492 eV to be compared to the NIFER data (Kim and Koike, 2008) respectively at 37.251 eV and 38.762 eV. For the 3p5s 1P° level the difference in energy position is at 2.792 eV which is very large. This great discrepancy can be justiﬁed arguing that the NIFER data (Kim and Koike, 2008) at 37.251 eV may be probably inaccurate. In fact according to the standard quantum defect expansion given by Eq. (3), for the same energy limits, the energy positions of the 3pnd 1P° series are greater than those of the 3pns 1P° series as the quantum defect is positive and negative respectively as shown by the SCUNC data displayed in Table 7. That means E (3pnd 1P°) 4 E (3pns 1P°) for the same nl-level. This condition is not satisﬁed by the noniterative formulation of the eigenchannel R-matrix pre- diction since E(3pnd 1P°) oE (3pns 1P°) for all the NIFER values of Kim and Koike (2008) as clearly shown in Table 7. As far as widths are concerned, the agreement is seen to be satisfactory for the levels. Overall, additional R-matrix calculations on Si2þ are ne- cessary to enlighten the accuracy in the NIFER results (Kim and

Koike, 2008). The SCUNC data expected to be precise may then be useful guidelines for future studies on the Photoionization of the (3pnd 1P°) and E (3pns 1P°) series of the Mg-like Si2þ ions. Table 8 presents resonance energy, effective quantum number, effective nuclear charge, quantum defect and width of the 3pns  1P° and 3pnd 1P° series of S4þ. Here, only the R-matrix calculations of Kim and Kwon (2013) are found in the literature for direct comparison. The agreements between the calculations are seen to be good for both energy positions and widths of the 3pns 1P° and 3pnd 1P° series. It should be underlined that, for both the present SCUNC and R-matrix predictions (Kim and Kwon, 2013), E (3pnd 1P°) 4E (3pns 1P°) for the same nl-level. In Tables 9,10, comparison in- dicates in general, good accord between the SCUNC results and the

only available R-matrix calculations of Kim and Kwon (2015) for  the Mg-like Cl5þ (Table 9) and for the Mg-like Ar6þ (Table 10). But,great discrepancies are found for the 3pnd 1P° of Ar6þ. For the ﬁrst
3p6d 1P° entry for example, the SCUNC energy position is equal  to 123.14 123.14eV. This data disagrees with the R-matrix predictions (Kim and Kwon, 2015) at 126.226 eV about 3 eV. New calculations form

other methods are required to enlighten the discrepancies be- tween the SCUNC and the R-matrix [9] predictions of Kim and Kwon (2015) on the energy resonances of the 3pnd 1P° members
as quoted in Table 10. Besides, it should be highlighted again that E (3pnd 1P°) 4 E (3pns 1P°) for the same nl-level for both the present SCUNC and R-matrix predictions (Kim and Kwon, 2015) in contrast with what is observed in the case of the NIFER forecast (Kim and Koike, 2008) on the Mg-like Si2þ ions.
3.2.Energy positions for Al þ 3pns 3P° series exhibiting ﬁne structure splitting
In the work of Hudson et al. (2005), ﬁne  splitting  structure of the 3pns 3P°series has been detected and only two target levels were available as ionization limits, i.e. the 2p63p2P0 and the 2p63p2P0
at 0.4892 Ryd and 0.4913 Ryd respectively.
Taking into account the ﬁne splitting structure of the 2p63p2P0 -
3pns  3P°  (  j  =  1 or   3 )  series,  we  express  the  energy  position as follows
@12
The fi ( 2P0; 3P°) -screening constants in Eq. (12) are evaluated using  the  experimental  measurements  on  Alþ  from   the  work of Hudson et al. (2005). The experimental energy positions are presented in terms of the free-electron energy in Rydberg as follows.
●for the 2P0 - 3pns 3P° series: E (3p5s 3P°)¼ 0.2103 Ryd; E (3p6s 1P°)¼ 0.3156 Ryd; 2P0 limit: 0.4892 Ryd.
●for the 2P0 - 3pns 3P° series:E (3p5s 3P°)¼ 0.2201 Ryd; E (3p6s P°) 3/2 2P0 limit: 0.4913 Ryd.¼ 0.3197 Ryd;
Table 11
Energy positions (E, Ryd), and quantum defects (δ) in terms of the free-electron energy of the 3pns 3P°1/2 and 3pns 3P°3/2 resonance series of Alþ.
Using the above experimental data, Eq. (12) provides respectively
The procedure of determinations of the f -screening constants is enlighten in the Appendix's section in the particular case of the 3pns series.
The results obtained from Eq. (10) are displayed in Table 11 and compared with experiments (Hudson et al., 2005). It  can  be seen that, the analytical SCUNC expression (12) reproduces very well the experimental data. The differences between the SCUNC calculations and the experimental measurements are less than 0.0008 Ryd for all the resonances. Overall, comparisons with the existing literature data give high credit on the present SCUNC predictions. Subsequently, the new data for Mg-like P3þ, K7þ, Ca8þ, Sc9þ, Ti10þ, V11þ, Cr12þ, Mn13þ, and Fe14þ ions  expected  to  be accurate may be good benchmarked data for future investigations in these Mg-like ions. Before closing the discussion's section, it will be interesting to state about the number of terms used in the ex- pansions of the energy resonance and of the width. In the present
calculations, we have used only two terms f1 and f2 for En and Γn. How much then En and Γn will be changed when the higher terms
beyond f2 are included. Let us considered the case of En. As ex- plained in Section 2.1, the expression of the energy resonance is in the form [Eq. (2)]
@
In this equation, q stands for the number of terms in the ex-
pansion of the β(Z, 2S+1LJ, n, s, μ, ν)–parameter and it gives the accuracy in the calculations. In general, precise resonance energies are obtained for q o5. In the framework of the SCUNC formalism, the value of q depends on the Rydberg's series considered. In Ta- ble 5 for instance, it is clearly shown that, using f1 and f2, very good (Ea) results are obtained. If one add f3, this term will contribute as follows considering Eq. (8) for instance:
@
In any case, the corrections will not contribute signiﬁcantly to the value of the energy resonance when four digits are considered in the calculations as shown in Table 5 (these contributions in- ﬂuence the data when one quote the SCUNC results with more  than ﬁve digits). If one adds other terms such as
@
and so on, these corrections tend rapidly toward zero are they
are expanded in inverse of Zp (p increasing). In the case of the 3pns and 3pnd series of Mg-like ions, calculations indicated that the use of f1 and f2 are sufﬁcient to obtain accurate results (see values quoted in Tables 5–11) and the contributions of the other terms are not signiﬁcant. Let us also underlined that, all the fk –parameters,   k Z3 are multiplied by (Z – Z0). In fact, in the framework of the SCUNC formalism, two experimental data are required to evaluate f1 and f2 for Z ¼ Z0. This eliminates all the other fk (Z  – Z0) terms for k Z3 in Eq. (2).
4.Summary and conclusion
alism has been used to report resonance energies and total natural width of the 3pns 1P°, and 3pnd 1P° Rydberg series of Mg-like (Z ¼ 13-26) ions. Excellent agreements between high resolution experiments at ALS and state-of-the art R-matrix calculations are obtained for Mg-like Alþ. The SCUNC calculations for the Mg-like S4þ, Cl5þ, and Ar6þ, compared with scarce R-matrix calculations New precise data for Mg-like P3þ, K7þ, Ca8þ, Sc9þ, Ti10þ, V11þ, Cr12þ, Mn13þ, and Fe14þ ions are tabulated as useful guidelines for future Photoionization studies on Mg-like heavy charged ions in connection with their application in laboratory, astrophysics, and plasma physics.
Appendix
For sake of clariﬁcation, let us move on giving an example for the determination of the fk-parameters. We consider here f1 and f2 for the 3pns states using Eq. (8). For these states, the experimental data of Hudson et al. (2005) used are E (3p5s 1P°)¼ 0.2059 Ryd (ν  5) and E  (3p6s 1P°)  0.3128  Ryd (μ  6) for Alþ (Z  Z0  13). These energies are measured with respect to the 3p 2P° LS limit at 0.49075 Ryd. In addition, the experimental data in terms of photon energy (eV) have been converted to free electron energies (Ryd) using the ionization potential of Alþ at 18.83 eV (Hudson et al., 2005). Using the above experimental data, we ﬁnd in eV: E (3p5s 1P°)¼ 21.631386 eV,       E        (3p6s       1P°)¼ 23.085786 eV     and
E1¼ 25.507 eV. Using these experimental data, we obtain from Eq.
@The same procedure is adapted to determine the fk-parameters in all the equations from (8)–(12). So we get for the 3pns 3P° and 3pnd 1P° series.
