Abstract
The major challenge for tissue engineering is the development of biomaterials that possess suitable chemical, mechanical, and topographical properties for cell culture. Functional polymers have shown promising results. This work showed a different methodology to synthesize a new functional polymer rich in primary amines on surface, using as substrate polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is a biocompatible polymer. For this purpose, PTFE was grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) by gamma radiation for its further functionalization with polyallylamine (PAA) to evaluate its hydrophilicity, roughness, thermal properties and amine content, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The presence of amine groups onto surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Grafting yields (≈50%) of GMA onto PTFE were obtained using the pre-irradiation oxidative method at dose of 10 kGy, reaction time of 10 h, and 50 °C. Further chemical functionalization of the grafted films with PAA yielded 3.8% surface nitrogen content, a root mean square roughness (RMS) value of 465 nm, and contact angle of 57.5°. The results suggest that the developed material may have potential applications as substrate for cell adhesion.

1. Introduction
Tissue engineering is creating a new generation of materials that are able to interact and bind with cells, which is very important for cell growth. Every cell line interacts differently with a material, and in many cases, the cell-surface interaction causes immunological responses and phenotype loss to protein adsorption onto low-energy surfaces. Additionally, this protein-surface interaction is believed to cause conformational changes on proteins that exhibit different ligands to cell receptors (Hodgkinson and Hlady, 2007).
Recent research has focused on generating materials that simulate the cell micro environment and enhance the cell-polymer interaction (Barletta et al., 2018). Polymers such as polystyrene, polyethyleneterephtalate, polytetrafluoroethylene and silicones have been the most studied materials for use as scaffolds because of their good mechanical properties, chemical structure and morphological versatility. In fact, cell–polymer interaction is essential due to its relation with early events, such as cell adhesion and spreading, and late events related to cell proliferation, differentiation and cell function (Chen et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the incorporation of different chemical functionalities generally promotes unfavorable protein adsorption and immune responses.
The modification of polymer matrixes with chemical groups such as carbonyls, amines, amides and hydroxyls can improve necessary properties such as higher hydrophilicity, roughness, no toxicity and good mechanical properties to facilitate their use as scaffolds, without altering intrinsic bulk material characteristics (Lee et al., 1994; Chen and Liu., 2016). In particular, amino groups are useful for tissue engineering (Borah et al., 2018; Meyer-Plath et al., 2003), drug delivery (Krovi et al., 2012), catalysis (Qu et al., 2016), heavy metal removal (Madrid et al., 2014), etc. Additionally, it has already been proven that amination of polymer substrates has a beneficial effect on cells in terms of adhesion, spreading and growth (Ino et al., 2013).
Amino groups can be grafted on a polymeric surface by chemical methods (Mévellec et al., 2007), plasma (Kajjoutet al., 2019; Lerouge et al., 2015; Aziz et al., 2015) and gamma radiation (Choi et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001; Luk et al., 2011, Madrid et al., 2014; Rodríguez-Alba et al., 2019). However, chemical methods generate byproducts and cause solvent waste, while the plasma process produces oxidation processes and fragmentation of monomers with the formation of undesirable groups such as imines, amides, nitriles, etc. Functionalization by gamma radiation does not exhibit these disadvantages. Radiation grafting allows the modification of polymer properties by grafting a monomer in bulk and/or on the surface with the desired depth (Chapiro, 2002; Hegazy et al., 2001). Additionally, this method is economically favorable and applicable for a wide variety of monomers.
Some attempts have been made to modify polymer substrates with primary amines using radiation (Luk et al., 2011; Nho et al., 1997). PTFE films were modified with primary amines by grafting acryloyl chloride (AC) using gamma radiation, followed by a reaction between the grafted AC and ethylenediamine (EDA) (Martinez-Cocoletzi et al., 2018). Aminated-PTFE films with a primary amine concentration of 3.3% on the surface were obtained. Madrid et al. (2014) introduced free amine groups in hyacinth fibers. First, fibers were grafted with GMA and then reacted with EDA. These researchers investigated the conversion of the epoxy group and heavy ion retention. On the other hand, Pérez-Calixto et al. (2019) modified polypropylene (PP) and PE films with allylamine (AA) in a one-step method, obtaining a nitrogen surface content of 8%. However, the doses used were high, and grafting was only possible by using a chemical initiator together with radiation.
In this work, a new methodology is explored to introduce a high content of primary amines onto polymer surface, to enhance the hydrophiliciy, roughness and nitrogen content, and thus obtain a material that can be applied as substrate for cell culture. PTFE was chosen as a biocompatible polymer because it's high biological inertia; it can be used to produce implants that not cause any reaction by the body and to develop devices that are in contact with blood. The synthesis was carried out in two steps. First, GMA was grafted onto PTFE using gamma radiation to incorporate the epoxy group in the structure, which can be chemically modified by a post-grafting reaction (Benaglia et al., 2013; Barsbay et al., 2016). In a second step, the PTFE-g-GMA was reacted with the (PAA) via an epoxy ring-opening reaction, obtaining the aminated film PTFE-g-GMA-PAA. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water-contact angle measurements, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to study surface modification.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 0.1 mm thickness) was obtained from Goodfellow (Huntington, UK) and previously purified by immersion in ethanol for 24 h. Then, it was dried under reduced pressure for further use. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, 99%, Aldrich) was distilled under a high vacuum. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAA·HCl, 99%) and resin Ambersep® 900 hydroxide from Sigma-Aldrich México and acetone and methanol from J. T. Baker (ACS grade) were used without any purification. Distilled water was used for all experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of PTFE-g-GMA
GMA grafting was carried out by a pre-irradiation oxidative method, using γ rays from 60Co source (Gamma Beam 651 PT), at a dose rate of 9.6 kGy h−1. PTFE films (1.2 x 4 cm) were placed into glass ampoules and irradiated in the presence of air to form peroxides and hydroperoxides, at doses from 5 to 40 kGy. Then, 7 mL of GMA solution (20–50% v/v) in methanol/water (80:20 v/v) was poured into the glass ampoules and bubbled with argon for 15 min. Subsequently, the ampoules were sealed and heated (50, 60 and 70 °C) at different time intervals (6–14 h). Samples obtained were rinsed with acetone to remove residual monomer and homopolymer; later they were vacuum-dried, and the grafting percentage was calculated with the following equation:
(1)Graft (%) = [(Wg-Wo)/Wo] x 100
where Wo and Wg represent the weights of the initial and grafted PTFE film, respectively.
2.3. Modification of PTFE-g-GMA with polyallylamine (PAA)
PAA·HCl was converted to PAA using a strongly basic ion-exchange resin. An aqueous solution (24 mL) of PAA·HCl (2 g) was placed into a flask containing 6 g of resin Ambersep® 900 in hydroxide form. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 24h under magnetic stirring. After this time, the solution was filtered, poured in a Teflon dish, and dried at 60 °C for 24 h to give PAA. 1H NMR (400 MHz Bruker, D2O, ppm): 1.1 (–CH2–), 1.5 (–CH–), 2.6 (–CH2–).
A methanol solution of PAA (8–45 mg mL−1) was added into a round-bottom flask containing a PTFE-g-GMA film (previously weighed). The reaction was conducted at 45 °C for 24 h under magnetic stirring; then, the functionalized film was rinsed with distilled water to eliminate un-reacted PAA.
2.4. Characterization
FTIR spectra were acquired by the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique using a PerkinElmer Paragon 500 by performing 16 scans from 4000 to 650 cm−1. TGA was conducted with TA Instruments TGA Q50 using nitrogen from room temperature to 800 °C. Contact angle measurements were performed with static sessile drop at room temperature, using a KRÜSS DSA 100 apparatus (Matthews, NC, USA) and distilled water. Small drops of water were deposited on the surface of materials by using a syringe, and the contact angles were measured immediately with Drop Shape Analyzer software.
XPS experiments were performed in a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The X-ray source used was a monochromatic Al anode (1486.6 eV). The surveys were obtained with 117.5 eV pass energy, and the analysis region was 1400 to 0 eV. The HRXPS signal was obtained with 11.5 eV pass energy. A dual beam charge neutralization system (PHI patented) was used to compensate for charging during XPS data acquisition. All measurements were made in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber at a pressure of approximately 3 × 10−8 mbar. In the fittings, Gaussian functions were used (after a Shirley background correction) where the FWHM of all peaks were constrained, while the peak positions and areas were set free. The surface morphological characteristics were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Dimension™ 3100 from Digital Instruments with a Pt-coated Si tip with a 15 nm nominal radius model (OSCM-PT Bruker). The images were obtained in tapping mode at a scanning rate of 1.0 Hz over 256 lines. The surface roughness (Rq) was calculated by the root mean square average (RMS) of height deviation, which was taken from the data plane using the Nanoscope IIIa software available in the microscope.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Grafting of GMA onto PTFE
Grafting of GMA onto PTFE using γ-rays is summarized in Scheme 1. In the first step, gamma radiation produces peroxides and hydroperoxides on the PTFE film due to the presence of oxygen. These groups can be thermally decomposed to generate free radicals onto film, which, upon contact with GMA, initiate the graft reaction. In the second step, the grafted film (PTFE-g-GMA) is placed into the methanol solution of PAA to carry out the reaction of the epoxy groups from GMA and the amine groups from PAA to obtain the aminated film PTFE-g-GMA-PAA.

Scheme 1. Amination of PTFE films by radiation grafting.
Fig. 1a shows the dependence of GMA grafting as a function of dose. The graft percentage increased with absorbed dose, reaching approximately 100% at a dose of 40 kGy. This is because at a higher dose, more active sites (peroxides and hydroperoxides) are generated, causing an increase in the grafting of GMA. However, it is important to mention that irradiation of PTFE at doses higher than 10 kGy causes polymer chain scission, and samples became rigid and easily broken. Furthermore, high graft percentages indicated the preferential grafting of GMA onto PTFE in bulk. Therefore, PTFE films with 20–30% GMA are ideal for the further surface amination step.
Fig. 1. Graft percentage of GMA as a function of (a) dose at 40% (v/v) GMA, 60 °C and 10 h, (b) concentration at 60 °C and 10 h, (c) temperature reaction at 40% (v/v) GMA, 10 kGy and 10 h, (d) time reaction at 40% (v/v) GMA, 10 kGy and 50 °C.
The dependence of the graft percentage of GMA onto PTFE as a function of monomer concentration at different doses is shown in Fig. 1b; as it can be seen, the graft percentage increased as the monomer concentration was raised fort the both doses until a concentration of 50% was achieved. Monomer concentrations higher than 50% did not permit higher graft percentages of GMA to be obtained due to the excessive formation of homopolymer in the reaction mixture. However, as mentioned above, it is better to irradiate at 10 kGy in order to avoid considerable polymer degradation and to ensure the formation of peroxide and hydroperoxides on the irradiated PTFE films. According to these results, a GMA concentration of 40% and dose of 10 kGy were used for further experiments.
The graft percentage as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 1c. From this figure, it can be observed that the maximum graft percentage (67%) was reached at 60 °C. An increase in temperature (from 50 to 60 °C) causes greater formation of grafting sites (free radicals) on PTFE due to the decomposition of more peroxide species. Additionally, a higher temperature may cause better monomer diffusion in the PTFE film, which increases the amount of grafted GMA. Although a temperature of 60 °C gave the maximum graft percentage, a temperature of 50 °C could be used due to the low formation of homopolymer observed during the grafting reaction. Finally, temperatures higher than 60 °C decreased the graft percentage due to the strong homopolymerization of GMA.
Fig. 1d shows the effect of reaction time on the graft percentage of GMA onto PTFE. GMA grafting increased with reaction time up to 8 h. Further increase of reaction time did not permit an increase in the grafting of GMA, probably due to a combination of the produced macroradicals and polymerization of GMA.
3.2. Modification of PTFE-g-GMA with PAA
Amination of PTFE-g-GMA with PAA was evaluated by monitoring changes in the weight of the sample before and after reaction. As shown in Fig. 2a, there was an increase of PAA grafting as the reaction time increased until 48 h. The amount of grafted PAA under these conditions is low, even lower that the direct grafting of allylamine in polyolefins (Pérez-Calixto et al., 2019). This behavior was due to the reaction of amino groups with GMA in any chain of the GMA or several groups of the same chain, and this steric impediment could be higher in the case of higher graft percentages because long chains are not expanded.
Fig. 2. Amination of PTFE-g-GMA34%with PAA as a function of (a) time and (b) PAA concentration.
On the other hand, the grafting of PAA onto PTFE-g-GMA as a function of PAA concentration at a constant reaction time of 48 h is shown in Fig. 2b. The grafting of PAA increased as its concentration did. However, PAA concentration was limited by its solubility in methanol. The maximum graft of PAA was around 4%.
3.3. Characterization of modified PTFE films
3.3.1. Contact angle
Pristine and modified PTFE films were characterized by measuring the contact angle formed by a water drop on their surface. Results indicated that pristine PTFE showed the highest contact angle value due to its hydrophobic nature (Table 1). In contrast, modified PTFE films showed a reduction of contact angle, indicating that the surface became more hydrophilic. A significant increase of hydrophilicity was observed for the PAA-modified PTFE films, showing a contact angle of 57.5°. This is due to the presence of polar amine groups on its surface, which have great affinity for water.
Table 1. Contact angle of different systems.
Sample	Contact angle (°)
PTFE	101.3 ± 0.1
PTFE-g-GMA34%	78.4 ± 2.4
PTFE-g-GMA-PAA4%	57.5 ± 3.3
3.3.2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA curves for pristine and modified PTFE films are shown in Fig. 3. Pristine PTFE showed one weight loss at 580 °C due to the main chain scission, while the PTFE-g-GMA sample showed two losses. The first weight loss occurred at 353 °C due to the decomposition of GMA, while the second one (577 °C) was attributed to the PTFE decomposition. A similar trend was observed for the TGA curve of the PTFE film modified with PAA, which showed less thermal stability in the range of 200–400 °C, probably due to the presence of PAA.

3.3.3. FTIR spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra of unmodified and modified PTFE films are shown in Fig. 4. Pristine PTFE showed characteristic bands at 1197 cm−1 and 1143 cm−1that are attributed to asymmetrical and symmetrical CF2 stretching vibrations, respectively (Fig. 4c). The grafting of GMA was confirmed by the presence of a band at 1727 cm−1 due to the Cdouble bondO stretching vibration from GMA as well as a signal at 906 cm−1 attributed to the epoxy ring vibration (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, the FT-IR spectrum of the PAA-modified PTFE film showed additional peaks at 3354 and 1630 cm−1 due to N–H stretching and bending vibrations, respectively, as well as a weak signal at 1536 cm−1 due to N–H deforming vibrations of NH3+,which suggests the presence of PAA on the surface of the PTFE film (Fig. 4a). Additionally, it is interesting to note that signal at 906 cm−1 was not observed, indicating the successful epoxide ring opening caused by the reaction with PAA.

3.3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The grafting of GMA and PAA onto PTFE was confirmed by XPS. This technique permits the study of polymer surfaces and provides information on the elemental composition of the first 3 or 4 molecular layers of the external surface of materials. XPS was used to map the elemental composition and the type of chemical bonds on the modified PTFE film surface. The XPS survey spectra of PTFE-g-GMA and PTFE-g-GMA-PAA are shown in Fig. 5. The signals of C 1s and O 1s as well as a low intensity signal assigned to F 1s are observed in the survey spectrum of the PTFE-g-GMA sample (Fig. 5a).
Fig. 5. XPS survey spectra of (a) PTFE-g-GMA11% and (b) PTFE-g-GMA-PAA4%.
The occurrence of the signal of O 1s and the weak intensity of F 1s demonstrate the graft of GMA onto the surface of PTFE. On the other hand, the survey spectrum of PTFE-g-GMA-PAA showed new C 1s,O 1s, and F 1s peaks corresponding to the PTFE-g-GMA film. The presence of an additional signal at approximately 400 eV assigned to nitrogen (N 1s) was observed due to the PAA grafted onto the PTFE surface (Fig. 5b). Weak signals of Cl 2p were observed, probably due to residues of HCl in the grafted PAA, which was obtained after the treatment of PAA·HCl with the ion-interchange resin Ambersep®.
On the other hand, the high-resolution C 1s for the PTFE-g-GMA and PTFE-g-GMA-PAA are shown in Fig. 6. Deconvolution analysis for the C 1s spectrum showed several types of carbon. For PTFE-g-GMA, the main peaks appeared at 284.6, 285.1, and 286.6 eV due to the C–C, *C-(Cdouble bondO), and C–O bonds, respectively (Fig. 6a). These bonds agreed with those present in the GMA chemical structure, confirming the presence of this polymer on the PTFE surface. For the PTFE-g-GMA-PAA sample, the C 1s deconvolution analysis identified peaks at 284.6 (C–C, C–H) and 285.4 eV (*C-(Cdouble bondO)) as well as the appearance of an amine C─N contribution (286.2 eV). Additionally, the disappearance of oxiranes C–O–C (286.6 eV) can be observed, confirming the ring-opening of epoxy groups from GMA as observed in the FT-IR study (Fig. 6b) (Wu et al., 2019). Additionally, the N 1s spectrum exhibited three main peaks at 399.7, 400.6 and 402.1 eV, which can be attributed to the sp3 C–N, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C–N–H), and quaternary amine groups C–N+, respectively (Fig. 6c) (Xiang et al., 2011; Qu et al., 2016).

The surface atomic concentration values are summarized in Table 2. As seen, the atomic contents of O decreased, as the PTFE-g-GMA was modified with PAA. Additionally, the presence of the atomic content of N 1s in sample PTFE-g-GMA-PAA was attributed to the PAA as well as to a slight increase in the content of hybridized sp3carbon, confirming the graft of PAA onto the PTFE-g-GMA film surface.

Sample	C 1s	O 1s	N 1s	F1s	Cl 2p
PTFE-g-GMA11%	63.4	31.2	–	0.8	–
PTFE-g-GMA-PAA4%	67.4	16.0	3.8	7.5	0.4
In spite of the low PAA reacted in the graft system, the amount of primary amines present on the surface is in the range necessary for adhesion for cell growth on the surface according to the literature.
3.3.5. Atomic force microscopy
To determine the effect of each treatment on the surface morphology of the deposited layers, AFM measurements were conducted to examine the changes in surface topography (Fig. 7). The AFM images of PTFE-g-GMA (Fig. 7a) and PTFE-g-GMA-PAA (Fig. 7b) revealed a wide valley area (dark colored) and high-hill regions (light colored) as a consequence of the grafting processes on the surface of the PTFE film. However, it can be seen that the AFM image for sample PFTE-g-GMA-PAA showed hilly and valley structures with elongated pillars that were homogeneously distributed, giving the impression of a rougher surface. In this sense, the changes in morphology were quantified by root mean square roughness. The root mean square roughness (RMS) denotes the standard deviation of Z values along the studied area. The RMS roughness value found for sample PTFE-g-GMA was 216 nm, while that for PTFE-g-GMA-PAA was 465 nm. This finding suggests that modification with PAA permits a rougher surface to be obtained, which may help to increase bio-interactions for cell adhesion and/or physical immobilization of biomolecules.

4. Conclusions
This paper presents a different methodology to synthesize a new functional polymer rich in primary amines on surface, using gamma radiation. PTFE was grafted with GMA and then modified with PAA by chemical reaction. A significant decrease in the contact angle was observed after modification (57.5°) being lower than those values found for other materials modified by gamma radiation and plasma (~70°), suggesting a higher hydrophilicity for synthesized material. The roughness was also changed after grafting with PAA, increasing from 216 nm for PTFE-g-GMA to 465 nm for PTFE-g-GMA-PAA (11% graft), while the content of nitrogen in surface was of 3.8%. Both values were higher that found in previous works, showing that the new methodology used was effective to aminate polymer surfaces without using high doses and complex reaction. These studied parameters are important because they could promote the cell proliferation and cell attachment. The results suggest that the developed material may have potential applications as substrate for monocytes cell adhesion; its proliferation is favored by the presence of primary amine groups, the rough surfaces and high hydrophilicity.
