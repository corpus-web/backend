ABSTRACT
With the development of nuclear power technology, third-generation nuclear power plants (NPPs) are being built in many places. Examples include the American passive AP1000 NPP, the French EPR NPP, and China’s Hualong One NPP. These will become the main reactor type for future NPP construction. Base isolation is employed as the aseismic technology in NPPs, and its design standard has been standardized according to ASCE 4–16 and other related codes. Since the 9/11 terrorist incident, large commercial aircraft impact (AI), as a beyond design-basis event, has attracted increasing attention in nuclear research. In the case of a third-generation NPP with isolation technology, it is necessary to evaluate its safety and integrity against AI. In this study, the dynamic response of a base-isolated third-generation NPP subjected to impact by a large commercial aircraft, the Airbus A340-300, is investigated. The most typical design for a third-generation NPP is to build many buildings on the same base-mat. The presence of a flexible isolation layer renders the dynamic behavior of a base-isolated NPP different from that of a non-isolated NPP under AI loads. Five key factors, including the horizontal stiffness of isolation bearings, horizontal damping of isolation bearings, total weight and weight distribution of the NPP, and AI force and direction affect the vibration characteristics of NPPs. The horizontal stiffness of isolation bearings affects the constraint effect of the foundation on the superstructure, while the damping of isolation bearings affects the dissipation of impact energy. Meanwhile, the total weight and weight distribution of the NPP affect the vibration response of different regions, and the impact force affects the vibration intensity of the NPP.

1.Introduction
Research on the problems of aircraft impact (AI) on nuclear power plant (NPPs) was initiated by Riera in 1968. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, public concern on AI on NPPs has been increasing. In this context, several guidelines, such as 10CFR50.150 (2009) and NEI 07–13 Rev. 8. (2011), have been formulated to protect the safety and integrity of NPPs under deliberate impact by large commercial aircraft. For evaluating the safety of NPPs under AI, the following aspects are generally considered: the global structural damage, local structural damage, and effects of fuel-initiated fires, as well as the functional failure of the structures, systems, and components (SSCs) due to the induced vibrations in the structural members and safety related equip- ment (IAEA, 2014). Global structural damage refers to the overall building behavior in response to the applied AI loading, such as the collapse of large portions of the building walls, floors, and load carrying
members. M.R. Sadique et al. (2013) pointed out that large commercial aircraft such as Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 767-400 are more likely to cause global damage of containment than small and medium aircraft Airbus A320 and Boeing 707-320. There are many factors that affect the local damage of NPPs, such as the impact angle and impact velocity of aircraft, the aircraft type and the prestress of prestressed steel bar (M.A. Iqbal et al., 2012; Kyoungsoo Lee et al., 2013; M. Kostov et al., 2014; M.
A. Iqbal et al., 2014). Sang Shup Shin et al. (2016) appraised the vi- bration safety of the internal equipment and components in the primary auxiliary buildings. Jeon et al. (2012) and M.R. Sadique et al. (2018) analyzed the influence of an induced fire from an AI on the outer containment of an NPP.
Currently, the subject of main research attention is third-generation NPPs, such as the American passive AP1000 NPP, French EPR NPP, and China Hualong One NPP. Because of their excellent design and adap- tation of new technology, the safety of the third-generation NPPs is much better than that of second-generation NPPs. There are a number of

methods to improve the safety of NPPs under AI, such as increasing the thickness of the outer wall, increasing the strength of concrete, using steel plate concrete, and using redundant designs with double contain- ment. Seismic isolation is proven as an effective technology for reducing the seismic response of a superstructure. Due to a lack of relevant standard guidelines and requirements for the analysis, design and con- struction of isolation systems specific to nuclear structures, this
technology has been applied for NPPs in only a few places in France and South Africa (Manish Kumar et al., 2015). Fig. 1 shows a Jules Horowitz Reactor (JHR) with 195 isolators. Fig. 2 shows the International Ther- monuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) with 493 elastomeric bearings. Currently, seismic isolation technology is not being used for three-third-generation NPPs. However, the effectiveness of this method has been proved by extensive research. The most effective way currently

available to assure the seismic safety of NPPs is to use isolation tech- nology. We feel that designing relevant standards provides effective technical support for the application of this isolation technology in future. In the Chapter 12 of ASCE/SEI 4–16, the analysis methods, design, and construction requirements pertaining to seismically isolated safety-related nuclear structures are presented. However, for the third-generation NPPs with seismic isolation technology, there are few studies on the dynamic response of that structure under AI.
From the viewpoint of the mechanical properties of rubber isolation
bearings, if there is a large number of such isolation bearings distributed under the base-mat, the constraint effect of the foundation on the su- perstructure will be significantly reduced. Seismic energy acting on the superstructure is transmitted from the ground, while AI energy is released directly onto the superstructure, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Owing to the presence of a flexible isolation layer between the base-mat and foundation, propagation of the seismic energy propagating to the su- perstructure can be weakened. When an aircraft directly impacts the superstructure, the dynamic response of the latter will inevitably be affected by the reduction in the constraint effect of the foundation.
Manish Kumar and Whittaker (2017) pointed out that in-structure spectral demands on base-isolated NPP internal SSC s vary depending on the fixed-base condition. Because the crash duration is very short, local failure of base-isolated structures is not much different from that of non-isolated structures under AI loads (Runyu Mei et al., 2017). Because of the structural characteristics of third-generation NPPs, their shielding buildings and auxiliary buildings are all located on the same base-mat. Vibrations generated by aircraft crash spread to other places along the outer walls and floor. In addition, due to the existence of isolation bearings, AI causes the entire structure to rocking. The structures of different types of NPPs are different, owing to which the propagation paths of vibration responses and rocking characteristics of these struc- tures are different. Sang Shup Shin et al. (2016) analyzed the vibration response of auxiliary buildings alone under AI. Two of these buildings for the tested NPPs were interconnected, owing to which it was impos- sible to separate these two buildings during the vibration safety evalu- ation of SSCs. It is known that internal equipment and instruments account for a large part of the construction cost of the entire NPPs, and hence their vibration safety must be guaranteed. Therefore, the influ- ence of the installation of isolation bearings on the vibration response of third-generation NPPs was chosen as the main focus of this study.
Presently, there are two main computational methods that can be
implemented for AI analysis, namely force-time history analysis and missile-target interaction analysis. In the assessment of shock vibrations of an NPP due to aircraft crash, it is very convenient to adopt the former method; further, the calculated results have a certain reference value.

However, in order to obtain more accurate vibration results corre- sponding to NPPs under AI, the latter method is a better choice when considering a complex three-dimensional finite element (FE) aircraft model (Sang Shup Shin et al., 2016).
In this study, AI analysis of a base-isolated NPP is performed using the missile-target interaction method. This article is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 establishes a representative detailed three-dimensional (3D) solid model of an NPP for AI analysis, a 3D NPP shell model for seismic analysis, and a 3D model of airbus A340-300. In this section, the accuracy of the aircraft model is verified by comparing the impact force of AI on rigid target plates and the impact force calculated by the Riera method. According to the relevant requirements, a suitable seismic isolating bearing is designed, and the performance of these isolation bearings is analyzed and verified (Section 3). In Section 4, based on a 3D

FE model of the NPP, two different impact locations at different heights, damage distribution and displacement response of the NPP, maximum shear deformation of the isolation bearings, and the floor response spectrum (FRS) of the NPP are analyzed. The obtained conclusions are presented in Section 5.
2.FE modeling of the NPP and aircraft
2.1.FE modeling of the NPP
In this investigation, a third-generation NPP was used for AI analysis. The main body of the shielding building was designed as a cylindrical concrete structure with an inner diameter of 45.77 m and wall thickness of 1.1 m. In subsequent calculations and analysis, two kinds of NPP FE models were adopted to meet different computational requirements.
Fig. 7. FEM model for seismic analysis.
The first model divides NPP concrete into a solid element, which is used for AI, as shown in Fig. 4. The mesh size of the FE model of NPP has a great influence on the calculation results. The longitudinal and circumferential element sizes of shielding building refer to Sang Shup Shin et al. (2016). The sensitivity analysis of element size along the thickness of the outer wall of shielding building is conducted. Three different element sizes are considered: 220 mm, 183 mm, 157 mm. The comparison results of the displacement time history of the center node in impact area under airbus A340-300 impact are shown in Fig. 5. The impact velocity of the aircraft is 150 m/s. The impact location is the Location 1 in Fig. 25. It can be seen from the comparison results that the maximum deformation of model-220mm is the smallest, which is quite different from the other two models. The displacement time history curve of model-183mm is very close to that of model-157mm. In order to
reduce the calculation scale, model-183mm is selected. Finally, the element size 400 183 300 mm3 of the solid element was selected; it consisted of 927846 nodes and 739367 solid elements. There were 6
solid elements along the thickness of the containment, as shown in  Fig. 6. Shell element of steel plate and solid element of concrete are
joined by common node. The auxiliary building wall included 2 layers of solid elements along the thickness direction. The second model is a shell element model, which was used for seismic analysis, as shown in Fig. 7. The mesh size of the whole model was 1.5 m, and it included a total of 18913 elements; this approach avoided the use of a solid model (Fig. 4), and thus improved the process efficiency. As for the first model, the verification of its constitutive model of concrete is discussed in the next section. The second model is a linear elastic constitutive model, whose basic material parameters refer to material parameters of the solid element model.
2.1.1.Analytical model of concrete and steel plate
The damage experienced by and evolution of concrete under dy- namic loading is quite complex, owing to the inclusion of parameters such as the explosive load and impact load. A proper analytical model of concrete can effectively reflect the dynamic behavior of concrete structures under such loads. In order to describe the deformation and failure characteristics of concrete under large deformation and a high strain rate, the Holmquist-Johnson-Cook (H-J-C) model was selected for AI analysis; this model was built on the basis of the Johnson-Cook model by Holmquist et al. (1993). The strength portion of this concrete mate- rial is presented in Fig. 8. The normalized equivalent stress σ* is defined

where P* represents normalized hydrostatic pressure, P corresponds to actual  hydrostatic  pressure,  D  is  the  damage  ð0 � D � 1Þ,  ε_*  is  the dimensionless strain rate, ε_ indicates actual strain rate, ε_ 0      1s—1  is the reference strain rate. In Eq. (1), the material constants are A, B, N and C.

The damage for fracture is shown in Fig. 9. The model discussed herein accumulates damage from both equivalent plastic strain and plastic volumetric strain, and is expressed in Eq. (3). Δεp and Δμp represent the equivalent plastic strain and plastic volumetric strain, respectively, during a cycle of integration. The normalized maximum
tensile hydrostatic pressure is T* ¼ T=fc; where T is the maximum tensile hydrostatic pressure the material can withstand. D1, D2 and EFMIN in Fig. 9 are damage constants. Damage due to plastic volumetric strain is included in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) because the concrete will lose cohesive strength during air void collapse.

The material parameters required by JHC model can be divided into five categories: basic parameters, limit surface parameters, equation of state parameters, damage parameters and rate effect parameters (Sun  et al., 2016). The basic parameters contain density, shear modulus, fc and T. The limit surface parameters contain A, B, N and Smax. The equation of state parameters contain K1, K2, K3, Pc, μc, Pl and μpl. The damage parameters contain D1, D2 and EFMIN. The strain rate is controlled by parameter C.
It is difficult to determine the exact values of many parameters in the Fig. 18. Total impulse of AI on rigid plates at an impact velocity of 200 m/s.
model without experimentation. When conducting qualitative analysis and research, the parameters can be selected according to the sugges- tions of relevant scholars, and the accuracy of the results can be guar- anteed. Xiong et al. (2012) calibrate the parameters of JHC model by carrying theoretical analyses, experimental tests and numerical simu- lations. Sun Qiran combined the Hanchak experiment to analyze the damage parameters of JHC model. Because the NPP in this paper is similar to the calculation FE model in Zhang Xingbin (2016), the pa- rameters of concrete are referred to Zhang Xingbin (Table 1). Consti- tutive plastic kinematic model is adopted for steel plate. The parameters of the steel plate are also shown in Table 1.
In order to verify the rationality of the JHC model for concrete, plastic kinematic model for steel plate and the connection between concrete element and steel plate element, impact tests conducted by Mizuno in 2005 on 1/7.5-scale aircraft model impacting steel plate reinforced concrete panel were simulated. FE model of the 1/7.5-scale aircraft is shown in Fig. 11 and FE model of HSC-60 panel are shown in Fig. 12. The impact velocity of the scale aircraft model is 149 m/s. The thickness of panel is 60 mm. In addition to the basic parameters, the material parameters of concrete slab need to be determined according to the data in the experiment, other parameters refer to Xiong yibo. The reinforcement and stud is embedded in the concrete using the keyword
*CONSTRAINED_LARGRANGE_IN_SOLID. According to the different connection modes of steel plate shell element and concrete panel solid element, two models are constructed. In Model 1, steel plate and con- crete are connected by using keyword *CON- TACT_TIED_SURFACE_TO_SURFACE. Model 2 is a common node connection. Model 2 does not contain stud. Fig. 13 shows the fracture process of aircraft model and FSC60 panel for Model 1 and Model 2. From the comparison results, it can be seen that the fracture process of the two models is basically the same. From the engine velocity curve in Fig. 14, the results of Model 1 and Model 2 are very close. In addition, the engine’s velocity varies little from Muhammad Sadiq et al. (2014)’s. Therefore, the selected concrete material constitutive model and the corresponding material parameters are reasonable and can be used for further calculations.
2.2.FE modeling of the aircraft
The aircraft model used in this study was Airbus A340-300, a long- range, four-engine, wide-body commercial passenger jet airliner devel- oped and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus. Its fuselage length, wingspan, empty weight, and maximum take-off weight are 63.6 m, 60.3 m, 129 ton, 275 ton, respectively. A detailed FE model

of this aircraft is shown in Figs. 15(a) and 14(b). The internal structure of the aircraft includes a ring beam, longitudinal beam, central wing box, wing rib, and other parts, as shown in Fig. 15(c). The aircraft FE model includes 110601 nodes, 48291 beam elements, and 68214 shell ele- ments. The Johnson Johnson-Cook constitutive model is adopted for all metals in the aircraft. The material parameters of these metals are shown in Table 2. Aircraft fuel is added to the corresponding position in the

form of additional mass. In addition, the quality of seats and other components on the aircraft is considered by adding mass. Finally, the total weight of the aircraft is 243 ton.
In order to verify the rationality of the aircraft model, impact force calculated by the Riera method and impact force of the aircraft on a rigid target plate calculated by the numerical method were compared. Fig. 16 shows the aircraft impacting a rigid target plate. Eq. (7) to Eq. (9) represent the so-called Riera formula.

F t is the force between the aircraft and rigid target plate, V t is the velocity of the aircraft at time t, M t is the mass of the aircraft at time t, x t is the length of the collapse of the aircraft at time t, and μ x is the longitudinal mass distribution of the aircraft. P x t is the crushing strength of the aircraft at time t.
Using the Riera formula, impact force was calculated using the crushing strength, mass distribution, and initial velocity. In the as- sumptions of the Riera method, it was proposed that the deformation zone lies at the cross-section next to the target, the material of the aircraft is regarded as ideal-plastic, and the crushed portion of the aircraft vanishes with zero velocity, while the uncrushed portion im- pacts the target as a whole and decelerated by the airframe crushing strength. In the 1993 experiment, the mass coefficient α was introduced and Eq. (9) was transformed into Eq. (10). α is equal to 0.9 in general, indicating that 90% of the mass of the aircraft is used as the impact force onto the target concrete (Sugano et al., 1993).

The mass distribution μ x t along the axis from nose to tail can be calculated from the FE model of the aircraft. Crushing force P x t is difficult to determine. By comparing the numerical simulation and experimental results, a simplified Riera formula in Eq. (11) is proposed by Kyoungsoo Lee et al. (2014). In this formula, the influence of crushing force is neglected and α is changed into 1. Because the aircraft impact is soft impact, the proportion of crushing force to the overall impact force is very low (Tao Zhang et al., 2015). Eq. (11) will be used to calculate AI force in subsequent analysis.

Fig. 17 shows the impact force history for these two methods at an impact velocity of 200 m/s. It can be found that the impact force time history curve calculated by the numerical simulation method fits well with the time history curve calculated by the Riera method. As shown in Fig. 18, the total impulse obtained by the Riera method is similar to that calculated from FE simulation. The results of this comparative analysis illustrate that the aircraft model constructed in this paper study is relatively reasonable.
3.Seismic isolators
There exist several types of isolation systems, such as the low-
damping rubber bearings (LDRB), lead rubber bearings (LDB), friction sliding isolator, high damping rubber bearings (HDRB), and friction pendulum isolator, which are being applied in many fields, including nuclear power reactors. Synthetic rubber isolation bearings used in JHR and ITER belong to the category of LDRBs. The isolation bearing designed for the International Reactor Innovative and Secure reactor is a HDRB (Manish Kumar et al., 2015). For these elastomeric bearings, the mathematical model corresponding to their shear behavior can be simplified into a bilinear restoring force model. In the LS-DYNA code, seismic isolators can be effectively modeled using the keyword
*MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR. The corresponding element and section are created using *ELEMENT_BEAM and *SECTION_BEAM, respectively.
Mei et al. (2018) studied the influence of horizontal stiffness and damping on the vibration response of containment under seismic load and AI, respectively. It was reported that damping by isolation bearings can accelerate the consumption of AI energy. In order to analyze the influence of other factors on the vibration of NPPs, in this study, an LDB isolation bearing was selected. A schematic diagram of the chosen bearings is shown in Fig. 19. In addition to bearing the gravity and horizontal force of the structure, the lead core can undergo plastic deformation and absorb a large amount of energy due to the seismic load to effectively reduce the response of the superstructure, which is one of the main characteristics of seismic isolation. Another important char- acteristic of such isolation bearings is their capacity to shift the funda- mental frequency of the system to a lower value, which is very different from the frequency band of common earthquake ground motions (Frano and Forasassi, 2010). The horizontal natural frequency of the isolation
system (fi) is equal to 1=2π K=M (K indicates total horizontal stiffness of isolation bearing, M is the total mass of structure). Selection of the isolation bearing and quality of the superstructure can control the nat- ural frequency range. Following the terms of a confidentiality agree- ment, the NPP considered in this paper contains only a concrete structure and steel containment without any internal equipment; therefore, the weight of the analysis model is lower than the actual structure weight. In order to reduce the natural frequency of the isolated structure to a certain range, isolation bearings with the properties listed in Table 3 were selected. The layout of 354 isolation bearings at the base-mat is shown in Fig. 20. Before conducting coupling dynamic analysis between AI load and the seismic isolation system, modal anal- ysis and seismic analysis of the base-isolated NPP were performed to determine the isolation performance of the bearings.
Overviews of the carried out numerical results in Table 4, the fundamental frequency of the base-isolated NPP is shift to the low range 0.6356 Hz. The boundary condition for non-isolated NPP is a fixed constraint at the bottom of the base-mat. And the fundamental fre- quency of the non-isolated NPP is 3.6925 Hz which are about 5.8 times to the base-isolated structure.
While analyzing seismic isolation performance, it is necessary to provide input seismic wave. In order to meet the relevant requirements, the input seismic wave is generally determined from the Regulatory Guide 1.60 (RG1.60) design response spectrum which was one of the earliest developed aseismic response spectra for NPPs in the United States in 1973. The seismic response spectra of NPPs adopted in many countries are directly affected by the RG1.60 design response spectrum. Further, artificial seismic wave is constructed using this spectrum. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) of input seismic waves was set at 0.3 g. Input acceleration spectrum spectra in the horizontal X and Y directions are shown in Fig. 21 and the acceleration time histories of RG1.60 in the horizontal X and Y directions are shown in Fig. 22.
The isolation performance of seismic isolation bearings was analyzed mainly from two aspects. The first task was to analyze the acceleration response of the superstructure and evaluate whether the isolation bearing can effectively weaken the influence of seismic load on the su- perstructure. The second aspect was to analyze the horizontal movement of the whole structure and verify whether the seismic isolation bearing

will cause excessive deformation detrimental to the stability of the structure (Frano and Forasassi, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Zhiguang Zhou et al., 2016). Generally, under seismic loads, an NPP mostly moves in the horizontal plane like a rigid body. FRS of the base-isolated NPP and non-isolated NPP at Point O in Fig. 7 are compared and analyzed. The results are shown in Fig. 23. For the non-isolated NPP, PGA in the X and Y directions at Point O were 1.50993 g and 1.7322 g, respectively. Meanwhile, for the base-isolated NPP, PGA values in the X and Y di- rections were 0.20272 g and 0.17273 g, respectively. It can be observed that the decreasing amplitude ratios (DARs) of acceleration responses at Point O were 86.61% and 90.03% in the X and Y directions, respectively. In addition, according to the horizontal response of the isolator at the center of the base-mat shown in Fig. 24, the maximum deformation of the isolation bearing under an earthquake load was 174 and 124 mm, respectively, in the X and Y directions. However, none of these values exceeded 3 times of Total thickness of rubber (Chen et al., 2014). The deformation of the isolation bearing is within the safe range.
According to these results, adequate use of the base-isolation system under the main base-mat leads to a drastic reduction in acceleration under seismic load conditions. A comparison of the results obtained for the base-isolated NPP and non-isolated NPP highlight the effectiveness of the selected LDR in mitigating the seismic response of the NPP to a certain extent.
4.Numerical simulation and analysis of AI on a base-isolated NPP
To analyze dynamic response with respect to variations in the impact velocity, we selected four reference impact velocities, 50, 100, 150, and 200 m/s. With an increase in the propagation distance, vibration in- tensity is attenuated. Two different impact heights were considered for AI, Location 1 and Location 2, as shown in Fig. 25. The analysis process for AI on a base-isolated NPP is analogous to the analysis process used for a base-isolated NPP under seismic loading. The response points for AI analysis are shown in Fig. 26. Points A–D refer to points on the auxiliary building, Point E is located at the center of the base-mat in the shielded building, and Point F is located on the water tank on the shielded building.
4.1.Damage distribution analysis
Fig. 27 shows the damage distribution of the base-isolated NPP under AI. With the increase of impact velocity, the damage of concrete
becomes more and more serious, and the damage area becomes larger and larger. When the AIs at the same velocity at these two locations, the damage of concrete at Location 1 is not different from Location 2. Fig. 28 shows the damage distribution of a non-isolated NPP at an AI velocity of 200 m/s. Regarding the isolated structure, AI produces a similar damage region distribution with non-isolated structure. The aircraft directly acts on the superstructure over a short duration of time, and therefore, the seismic isolation system is unable to influence the damage distribution of the NPP. Consequently, the possibility of excessive displacement and acceleration responses may cause internal equipment failure.
4.2.Displacement response analysis
The X displacement response of the base-isolated NPP with respect to variations in the AI velocity at Location 1 and Location 2 across Points A to F are shown in Fig. 29. After the impact is completed, the NPP will continue to move in the direction of impact until the maximum offset distance due to structural inertia force is reached. The structure achieves this offset distance in a very short time. Later, it is mainly affected by isolation bearings and the structure is subjected to free vibration attenuation.
Upon comparing the displacement time history of the NPP at different AI locations, it was found that the influence of impact location on the displacement time history was relatively small. Comparing the response time history curves at different points, it was observed that the time histories of Point B and Point C on the same side of the auxiliary building were very similar, while the time histories of Point A and Point D on the other side obeyed the same law. In addition, by analyzing the maximum offset distance of the NPP along the Y direction, it was found that the maximum offset distance increased from Point B to Point A, as can be clearly observed in Fig. 29.
Fig. 30 shows the maximum offset distance cloud chart of each isolator in the X direction for different AI locations with respect to changes in the AI velocity. Along the Y direction, the maximum defor- mation of the isolation bearing decreased in a linear manner. As it can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the height of the auxiliary building on the right side is higher than that on the left side. So, the weight of the right side is greater than left side. In Fig. 17, the number of isolation bearings on the right side of the auxiliary building is less than that on the left side (The description of left and right sides of the NPP below refer to the place- ment direction of the NPP in Fig. 4(a)). During AI, deformation of the isolation bearings is not very large and the NPP produces a certain in- ertial force in the direction opposite to that of impact. Therefore, the left

base-isolated NPP. Therefore, when analyzing AI for different types NPPs with seismic isolators, their structural motion response will be different.
In addition, the two selected impact locations are along the radial direction of the cylinder of the shielded building. Due to different weight distributions of the buildings on both sides of the impact direction, if the AIs at other locations in other directions, such as the right side of the auxiliary building, the vibration response of the NPP will inevitably change.
At different impact locations, the maximum offset distance of each isolator with respect to different AI velocity is compared in Fig. 31. And the comparison of the minimum and maximum values of the maximum offset distance of each isolator is shown in Table 5. At 200 m/s, the differential between the minimum and maximum values was 60 mm and the maximum shear strain of the isolation bearing is larger than the

result observed in seismic analysis. Hence, it can be concluded that the maximum offset distance is positively correlated with impact force.
Fig. 32 shows the displacement response of a non-isolated NPP under
AI at 200 m/s. Due to the presence of a fixed base-mat, the NPP will mainly undergo severe self-vibration. Greater the height, greater is the amplitude of vibrations. The impact location of the aircraft also affects

the vibration amplitude of the NPP. Because there is no horizontal translational motion of the NPP, the vibration amplitude of the non- isolated NPP is smaller than that of the base-isolated NPP. The maximum displacement at point F reaches about 14 mm when the aircraft impacts at Location 1, while at Location 2, the maximum displacement was about 39 mm.

A large number of important equipment and devices are used in the shield building, such as the reactor, pressure vessel, and steam gener- ator. Tables 3-3 on Equipment Shock Damage Categories in NEI 07–13

Rev. 8. (2011) specifies the allowable acceleration range for different equipment showing the importance of ensuring the vibration safety of these equipment. During the analysis of acceleration response, firstly,
the difference in FRS at different points is evaluated after which dif- ferences in the acceleration response at different impact velocities are analyzed.

4.3.1.Comparative analysis at different points
In this study, FRS in the X direction for the base-isolated NPP and non-isolated NPP at an impact velocity 200 m/s were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 33 and Fig. 34, respectively. It can be found that there were a large number of high-frequency components in the floor spec- trum. Without considering the influence of the impact location, Point F exhibits the maximum spectral acceleration response by virtue of being located at the highest position. Meanwhile, Point D is on the left side of the auxiliary building and close to the impact location and hence its spectral acceleration response is the second largest. In the case of the base-isolated NPP, except for Points D and F, the spectral acceleration response of other points is not very different at Location 1. At Location 2, the maximum spectral acceleration response of Point E is larger than that of other points because of the reduction in impact location height. The response of the base-isolated NPP at different points may change significantly depending on the impact location. In the non-isolated NPP, as the bottom of the base-mat is fixed, the response at Point E is very small. The responses of Points A, B, and C were not very different. Therefore, impact location has limited influence on acceleration response at these points.
Peak acceleration is an important parameter affecting the normal operation of inner equipment. PGA values at different reference points for the non-isolated NPP and base-isolated NPP at Location 1 and an impact velocity of 200 m/s are included in Table 6. The results for Location 2 are presented in Table 7.
It can be observed that in the non-isolated NPP, PGA did not vary very much at Points A, B, C, D, and F even when the impact location varied. However, the rate of change in PGA at Point E was quite high. For Location 1, the rate of change was 1160.02% while that for Location 2 was 1810.57%. Under AI loads, the installation of isolation bearings can significantly improve the PGA of a point located on the base-mat.
4.3.2.Comparative analysis at different impact velocities
In the current seismic codes, for a seismic adaptability analysis of NPPs, the design spectra and PGA of input ground motion should be specified. In the future, the design response spectrum of impact-induced vibrations in the internal equipment of an NPP will be specified. It is necessary to study the characteristics of acceleration time history and floor spectrum of a NPP under AI. In the following analysis, the accel- eration time history of Point E and variation in the FRS are analyzed at different impact velocities.
Fig. 35 shows the typical acceleration time history of an NPP under AI loads. At an impact speed of 50 m/s, the engine did not impact the NPP. PGA appears at 0.285 s at 100 m/s, 0.19 s at 150 m/s, and 0.14 s at
200 m/s. The acceleration time curve is basically divided into three segments; the first corresponds to interaction between the fuselage and structure, the second corresponds to the impact of the engine and wing on the structure (PGA occurs in this segment), and in the third section, the engine and wing impact is completed.
For different impact locations, PGA values at Point E is compared with respect to the impact velocity in Fig. 36 and Table 8. Although PGA increased, its growth rate decreased. In other words, PGA will not in- crease significantly beyond a certain impact velocity. Fig. 37 shows the floor spectrum results of Point E with respect to AI velocity. With an increase in impact velocity, the maximum spectral acceleration response increases, frequency band characteristics of the floor spectrum are widened, and frequency range of the peak floor spectrum changes significantly. These results also confirm Sang Shup Shin’s conclusion (2016).
5.Conclusions
The vibration characteristics of a base-isolated third-generation NPP under impact by a large commercial aircraft, Airbus 340-300, at different impact velocities were analyzed. The following conclusions could be drawn from this study.
In a third-generation NPP, the auxiliary building and shielding building are located on the same base-mat. If seismic isolators are ar- ranged under the base-mat, they will impact the constraining effect that the foundation on the superstructure. Because the weight of the super- structure sitting on the base-mat is not evenly distributed, inertial forces produced by the buildings on either side of the impact point will be different. The heavier side exhibits a greater inertial force compared to the lighter side. This will result in different motion states in the building in the direct of impact and away from it. The maximum deformation of the isolation bearing on the lightweight side is larger than that on the heavy side. Similarly, the acceleration response of the building on the heavy and lightweight sides is different. For example, the acceleration response of Point D is higher than that of Points A or B, although the height of Point D is lower than that of Points A and B. Impact force is proportional to impact velocity. Increasing the impact velocity of an aircraft will increase the vibration response of the building, but the rate of increase gradually reduces. This is reflected in the frequency band- width of the floor spectrum and PGA. In the vibration response analysis of base-isolated third-generation NPP under AI, it is suggested that five factors, namely horizontal stiffness of the isolation bearing, horizontal damping of the isolation bearing, total mass and mass distribution of the NPP, AI force, and aircraft direction should be considered comprehensively.
