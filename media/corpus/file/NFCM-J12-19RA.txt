Abstract
Pure and PbF2 doped CaF2 crystals were obtained in our crystal research laboratory. The influence of PbF2 concentration on the color centers induced by γ-and x-rays irradiation were studied. Two broad absorption bands with maxima peaked at 410 and 730 nm appear in the optical absorption spectra; the spectra are quite similar in band structure for all samples and for the both radiation. Different bands showed different responses to the irradiation and to the long-term recovery. The most stable color centers are (Fi0) and the dimer P-P (Pb+(1)-Pb2+). These absorption bands remain stable even for trace amount of Pb2+ ions, so CaF2:PbF2 is not a good material for applications in which the new optical absorption bands are undesirable.

1. Introduction
The quality and stability of the optical properties of crystalline materials are influenced by the lattice imperfections (vacancies, interstitials, dislocations) and the purity of the material (undesired or/and desired impurities). Fluorides (MeF2; Me=Ca, Sr, Ba) single crystals have several applications: as windows from UV and visible to infrared, as optic windows in fusion reactors, scintillators, laser materials etc. In all their applications, these materials are subjected to various types of radiations: laser, γ-rays, x-rays, electrons, ions, neutrons etc. It is important to study the influence of radiation damage on the optical properties of pure and doped crystals. The irradiation induced color centers of fluorides have been studied since 1950s by many researchers (Smakula, 1949, Messner and Smakula, 1960; Cooke and Bennett, 2003; Izerrouken et al., 2010). Usually, the damage is evaluated by measuring the optical absorption spectra as functions of absorbed dose and as time evolution. The induced color centers in pure CaF2 by various radiations are characterized approximately by similar absorption bands at 225, 260, 335, 385, 455, 550 and 580 nm (Messner and Smakula, 1960, Bennewitz et al., 1999; Cooke and Bennett, 2003; Xiang et al., 2006; Izerrouken et al., 2007; Izerrouken et al., 2010). There are many papers about the optical absorption spectra of x-rays, γ-rays, electron, neutron irradiated CaF2 crystals. The influence of lead ions on the optical properties of irradiated crystals were reported only in barium-lithium-fluoride (Baldochi and Gesland, 1992), in mixed KCl–KBr crystals (Cruz et al., 2001), in BaF2:Pb (Sastry and Kennedy, 1996). The inflruence of other impurities like uranium doped calcium fluoride crystals (Su et al., 2004), Strontium doped CaF2:Sr (Pandurangappa and Lakshminarasappa, 2013) was also mentioned. The studies of Lohse et al. (1987) and Fockele et al. (1989) refer to x-rays irradiated lead doped fluoride crystals (between 0.3 and 3 mol%) in order to identify the different Pb-centers. The study of color centers induced by γ-rays in Lead doped CaF2 crystals was not reported in literature.
At various γ-doses different absorption bands can appear in CaF2 (Fong and Yocom, 1964). The absorption peaks observed by Ausin and Alvarez Rivas (1974) at 227, 336, 393, 575 nm and weak peaks at 262, 365, 490 nm at high γ-rays doses differ from those noted by (Su et al., 2004) at 225, 254, 330, 360, 400, 520, 550, 605 nm irradiated at 520 kGy. X-rays irradiated CaF2 crystals studied by Cooke and Bennett (2003) shows absorption with maxima at 255, 330, 385, 510 nm along with additional weaker peaks at 460, 555 and 735 nm; they concluded that the major x-ray absorption peaks are associated with F and F-aggregate centers. Early on, Bontinck (1958) investigated the optical absorption induced in CaF2 by reactor neutrons at pile temperature and compared the results to x-ray-induced absorption; he found peaks near 200, 225, 340, 400 and 580 nm for x-rayed CaF2. Previous researches on electron, x-ray, γ-ray, and neutron irradiated CaF2 (Fong and Yocom, 1964, Scouler and Smakula, 1960; Ausin and Alvarez Rivas, 1974; Dantas et al., 1996; Cooke and Bennett, 2003) have shown that the absorption and luminescence are associated mainly with intrinsic defects, such as the F centers and their aggregates (M and R centers), H centers, or self-trapped holes (Vk centers). The absorption spectra of irradiated fluorides with color centers are characterized by a great variety, a high "sensitivity" to the conditions under which they have been grown and colored, and to the presence of various impurities.
Various impurities influence the radiation damage of CaF2 crystal in different ways. Oxygen and hydroxyl ions introduced into the crystal during the crystal growth at low vacuum or from the raw material are very harmful to the radiation resistance in UV region. The elements which changes its valence under irradiation, such as Sm, Eu, Dy and Yb, are useful in eliminating color centers in visible range.
In γ-rayed CaF2:Sr crystals (Pandurangappa and Lakshminarasappa, 2013) observed one strong absorption at 370 nm and two weak bands at 463, 524 nm for 100 Gy. For 9 kGy dose only two peaks at 370 and 520 nm were observed. Lohse et al. (1987) and Fockele et al. (1989) studied the x-rays irradiated alkaline earth fluorides doped with lead. They observed three types of new centers: Pb+(1), Pb0(2) and Pb+(1)-Pb2+ dimer with characteristic absorption bands in UV–VIS–near IR. Cruz et al. (2001) studied the gamma rays induced color centers of KCl–KBr mixed crystals doped with Pb2+. Nicoara et al. (2006) investigated the dielectric properties of x-rays irradiated CaF2:PbF2 crystals; the observed relaxations were associated with the substitutional lead ion and a nearest-neighbor fluorine vacancy. Sastry and Kennedy (1996) studied the luminescence properties of γ-irradiated BaF2:Pb single crystals. The optical absorption bands observed at 1.71 eV (720 nm) and 2.58 eV (480 nm) are assigned to Pb+(1) centers, stable up to 610 K.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of lead ions, especially of small amount of Pb impurity, on the optical properties of the γ-rays irradiated CaF2 crystals. In spite of the fact that the addition of PbF2 (~ 4%) in the CaF2 melt is used as scavenger in the crystal growth process (Stockbarger, 1949), sometimes a trace of Pb2+ ions are found in the obtained crystals.
To our knowledge, the effect of gamma irradiation on the optical properties of PbF2–doped CaF2 crystal has not been discussed in the literature.
2. Experimental details
Pure and PbF2 doped calcium fluoride crystals were obtained in our Crystal Research Laboratory using vertical Bridgman technique. As starting materials suprapure grade (Merck) CaF2 and PbF2 were used. In order to avoid the oxygen contamination, in the standard procedure of the CaF2 crystals growth, an addition of PbF2 (~ 4%) at the calcium fluoride powder is necessary (Stockbarger, 1949). Due to the high volatility of lead fluoride during all stages of the crystal growth process, the Pb2+ ions hardly remain in fluoride crystals (Baldochi and Gesland, 1992, Yonezawa et al., 2002). But if the crystal growth procedure is not well-chosen, the obtained crystals may contain some trace of lead ions (Fedorov et al., 2016). This is the reason why we study the influence of small amount of PbF2 in CaF2 on the optical properties of γ-irradiated crystals. In order to obtain lead doped CaF2 crystals with the desired PbF2 concentration, we used the procedure described by Nicoara et al. (2012). Single crystals of CaF2 doped with varied amounts of PbF2 (0.004–1 mol%) in the melt were obtained in spectral pure graphite crucible, using a shaped graphite furnace (Nicoara and Nicoara, 1988). The amount added to the melt is the nominal concentration. The crystals (10 mm in diameter and 5–6 cm long) are transparent and colorless. In order to estimate the content of the lowest concentration sample we used the following procedure. We did this because weighing errors can occur at such small amounts. The various concentration CaF2:PbF2 crystals were cleaved in 10–14 slices, ~ 2 mm thick. We selected, from every ingot, one slice with approximate same solidification fraction, g=z/L, where z is the position of the slice in ingot and L is the crystal length. In order to obtain the calibration curve, we chose the well-shaped, characteristic absorption band of the Pb2+ ions at 306 nm. The height of the absorption band is proportional with the sample concentration. The height of the absorption band for every slice was obtained from the normalized spectrum (obtained by removing the baseline) using the Gaussian one-peak fit. In order to obtain the calibration curve we used the amount of PbF2 added in the starting mixture in the melt: 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2 mol% PbF2. For low impurity concentration (until ~ 1 mol%) the absorption band height fit linear (Nicoara et al., 2012). From this fit, we estimated the concentration of the lowest PbF2 content sample is really ~ 0.004 mol% that is the nominal concentration and correspond to a trace amount in crystal (~ 40 ppm).
The samples (~ 2 mm thick) used in this study were cleaved from the as-grown boule and were irradiated at room temperature with γ-rays from a 60Co source with the average energy of 1.2 MeV, up to dose of 260 kGy and x-ray irradiated (40 kV, 30 mA) up to 3 h. The optical absorption spectra were recorded before and after irradiation by Shimadzu 1650PC Spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussions
The optical absorption spectra of the samples before irradiation are shown in Fig. 1a. and for those irradiated at the maximum dose are presented in Fig. 1b. along with the colorful crystals after irradiation. In order to study the radiation damage, in addition to gamma irradiation of pure CaF2 sample and two PbF2 doped samples, we also investigated the optical absorption spectra of x-rays irradiated CaF2:1 mol%PbF2 crystal. Lead in its divalent state substitutes Ca2+ in the CaF2 lattice, or enter in interstitial position. The characteristic optical absorption bands of Pb2+ ions in CaF2 are described in the paper (Nicoara et al., 2012). The absorption coefficient of the A band (306 nm) of the Pb2+ ions in CaF2 host, strongly depends on the PbF2 concentration, as we can observe in Fig. 1a, b. (for the lowest PbF2 concentration sample we used different scales in the graphs).

3.1. Absorption spectra of irradiated crystals
The radiation damage in the pure and doped crystals was studied by measuring the optical absorption (OA) spectra of samples before and after γ irradiation up to 260 kGy. The irradiation and the OA spectra were performed at room temperature. After accumulating the maximum dose, the OA spectra of the samples were measured over a period of 4–80 days in order to study the recovery effects. These measurements provided information on color center formation during irradiation as well as the short and long-term recovery from radiation damage immediately after exposure.
3.1.1. Absorption spectra of γ- rays irradiated CaF2:0.004 mol% PbF2
Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectra of CaF2:0.004 mol% PbF2 samples obtained after γ-rays irradiation at three doses. The optical absorption spectrum of the non-irradiated sample is also presented for comparison. Two broad bands centered on 410 nm and 730 nm characterize the OA spectra. The intensity of absorption peaks increases slightly by increasing γ-rays dose up to 260 kGy. There was no significant change in peak position and shape with the increase of the dose.

Due to presence of the Pb2+ ions, our OA spectra differ from those reported by others with absorption bands centered at about 225, 260, 340, 396 and 580 nm (see Table 1). The additional absorption spectra (AA=α-α0, where α and α0 are the absorption coefficient after and before γ-irradiation) were calculated to analyze the effect of irradiation (Fig. 2b). The new optical absorption bands induced by γ-irradiation can easier be observed from AA spectra than from the measured optical absorption. The two large absorption bands correspond to the superposition of the absorption bands of several color centers (various types of defects in lattice). In order to identify the main absorption bands of these broad bands and to see the influence of the γ-dose on the created color centers, the normalized spectra (obtained by removing the baseline) were decomposed by Gaussian multi-peak fit. For the sample irradiated at 260 kGy, five bands centered at 322, 366, 416, 577 and 728 nm were obtained. At low dose, the following peaks are observed: 260, 366, 410 and 730 nm, and shoulders at 220, 322 and 581 nm. Increasing the radiation dose, the absorption peak initially at 581 nm for the lowest dose, shifts towards 577 nm, while the peak at 726 nm moves slowly up to 728 nm; the position of the other peaks do not change with the γ-dose.

Different researchers observed various type of color centers (optical absorption bands) in irradiated CaF2 (see Table 1). Our obtained values for various peaks are consistent with the absorption bands observed by others, excepting the broad band centered at 728 nm. There are small differences between our peaks and those observed by other that can be explain if we take into account the presence of Pb2+ ions in CaF2 lattice, with various ionized states (Fockele et al., 1989). The presence of these ions near the simple color centers can modify the values of OA peaks; the formation of complex color centers cannot be excluded. The Pb+(1) centers (Pb+ ion adjacent to a fluorine ion vacancy in the [111] direction) were observed in x-rays irradiated alkaline earth fluorides doped with lead by Lohse et al. (1987). Two more lead centers, namely the Pb0(2) center and the dimer Pb+(1) - Pb2+ were detected by Fockele et al. (1989). The Pb0(2) center consists in Pb0 between two fluorine vacancies in the [111] direction (Bartram et al., 1989). The dimer is one Pb+ ion adjacent to a Pb2+ ion with the fluorine vacancy in one of the two common corners of the cubes containing the Pb+ and Pb2+ ions (see Fig. 3). The estimated absorption bands of these centers in CaF2 are 460 and 630 nm for Pb+(1); 338, 600 nm for Pb0(2) and 495 and 725 nm for Pb+(1) - Pb2+ dimers.
Fig. 3. Various lead centers with following absorption bands: Pb+(1)-460, 630 nm; Pb0(2)-335, 600 nm, dimer Pb+ (1)-Pb2+-495, 725 nm (Fockele et al., 1989).
The optical absorption increases with increasing the γ dose. In Fig. 4 is shown the variation of the values of the absorption coefficient of the peaks (obtained from the Gaussian multi-peak fit), as function of γ dose. Three growth stages are clearly observed: there is an initial slow stage then a faster one and finally at higher doses, a slow linear increase with tendency of saturation. The γ-dose dependence of the 577 nm band is lower than of the other bands. The behavior of these coloring curves is in agreement with the formation of the intrinsic defects (like vacancies or interstitials) during the irradiation. The absorption spectrum is stable in time. After accumulating the maximum dose, 260 kGy, the optical absorption spectrum of the sample were measured immediately after exposure and then over a period of 4–30 days. No significant change is observed in the spectrum in the investigated domain, either in the short (4 days) or long term (30 days) (Fig. 5a). Only in the left side of the band peaked at 410 nm, slightly increase (after 30 days) of the absorption coefficient (near the 306 nm) is observed, probable due the little increase of Pb2+ ions concentration after some color centers conversion in time, discussed in 3.1b and d. Taking into account these observations, results that the irradiation induced absorption bands, due to the color centers formation, remain stable in time, even for trace amount of PbF2 in CaF2 crystals.”

The optical absorption spectra and the additional absorption are shown in Fig. 6a and b.

A comparison of gamma-rays induced optical absorption bands of different PbF2 concentrations doped CaF2 samples, at the maximum dose (260 kGy), is shown in Fig. 7. The band structure of the two samples is quite similar. The differences consist in: (1) the values of the absorption coefficient (for the low PbF2 concentration sample these values are seven times lower) and (2) the clear evidence of the characteristic band (at 306 nm) of the Pb2+ ions, for the CaF2:0.4 mol% PbF2 sample. As in the case of the x-rays irradiated samples (see below), at the lowest dose (1 kGy), the 520 and 580 nm bands are present, but disappear at higher doses. The behavior of the peaks at 306 nm and 293 nm (corresponding to the Pb3+ ions) (see Fig. 6b) is similar as for the x-rayed sample, discussed in detail, below.
Fig. 7. Comparison of the γ-rays induced optical absorption bands of different PbF2 concentrations doped CaF2 crystals.
The intensity of the radiation induced absorption peaks increase with the increase of the γ-dose, including the peak at 295 nm associated to Pb3+ ions (Fig. 8); here is illustrated also the decrease of the 306 nm peak, due to the valence change of the Pb2+ ions during the irradiation process. There was no significant change in peak position and shape with increase in dose. The absorption spectra recorded from 4 to 30 days after exposure to γ-rays are shown in Fig. 5b. No significant change is observed in the spectra. The absorption bands peak at the same values, only slight modifications of bands intensities is detected. This means that the radiation induced color centers are stable in time.

3.1.3. Absorption spectra of γ- rays irradiated CaF2 sample
The absorption spectra of γ- rays irradiated CaF2 crystal depend on the irradiation dose (see Table 1.). As can be seen from Fig. 1b. the optical absorption spectrum of γ- rays irradiated CaF2 crystal differs from that of lead doped CaF2 samples irradiated at the same dose. For the lowest dose (1 kGy), two bands peaked at 386 and 620 nm are observed, while at 5 kGy seven weak bands are formed at 330, 386, 455, 564, 620, 688 and 745 nm. Increasing the radiation dose, the seven-peak structure of the optical absorption spectrum is reduced to two peaks; at the 260 kGy these peaks appear at 554 and 672 nm (see Fig. 1b). These absorption bands correspond to F aggregated centers, namely N (554 nm) and R (672 nm) centers. As the irradiation dose increases, the intensity of the absorption bands slightly increases. The transparent colorless CaF2 sample turned blue after γ- rays irradiation at 260 kGy dose (Fig. 1b). The optical absorption spectra recorded until 30 days after γ-rays irradiation (260 kGy) show the stability in time of the induced color centers (Fig. 5c). No new absorption band appeared, no absorption bands disappeared.
3.1.4. Absorption spectra of x-rays irradiated CaF2:1 mol% PbF2
In order to clarify why the optical absorption spectra of the sample with very small amount of PbF2 in CaF2 differ from those reported for “pure” CaF2, we also studied the behavior of the x-rays irradiated CaF2 doped with 0.5, 1 and 2 mol% PbF2. We present the results only for the CaF2:1 mol% PbF2, the other samples have same behavior. Fig. 1a. shows the optical absorption spectra of the all non-irradiated samples, the intensity of A band is proportional with Pb2+ ions concentration (Nicoara et al., 2012). The optical absorption spectra of the CaF2:1 mol% PbF2 sample during and after exposure to x-rays are shown in Fig. 9a.
Fig. 9. (a) Optical absorption spectra of CaF2:1 mol% PbF2 sample during and after exposure to x-rays; (b) dependence of the absorption bands intensity with increase of exposure time to x-rays.
Beside the Pb2+ ions A (306 nm) band, the OA spectra are characterized by three broad bands (I, II, III): (I) centered on 400 nm, the second band (II) extended from 450 to 650 nm and the (III) band centered on 730 nm. The II band changes his aspect during and after the irradiation (Fig. 9a). In order to obtain the optical absorption bands corresponding to the different color centers formed, we decomposed by Gaussian multi-peak fit the normalized spectra. In the Table 2, we summarized the obtained results. The insert in Fig. 9a shows the decomposed normalized spectrum of the one hour x-rays exposure. The obtained bands are centered at 306, 321, 340, 370 (very weak), 410, 515, 585, 727, 790 and 901 nm. The intensity of the various peaks changes both during the x-rays exposure and after irradiation (see Table 2). Not all the absorption bands grow proportionally with the irradiation time increasing from 1 h to 3 h. Particularly, the band at 410 nm grows most rapidly, while the bands at 518,580 and 730 nm slightly increase.

Fig. 9b shows the dependence of the peaks intensities on the exposure time to x-rays. The intensities of the 370, 518 and 581 nm peaks decrease during the irradiation, after 5 days these peaks are drastically reduced, and after 80 days pass away. The maximum of the III band, initially at 793 nm shifts towards 730 nm after 80 days. The strongest band peaked at 410 nm, is stable after 80 days. The color of the sample changes from brown towards deep green, like the color of the γ-rays irradiated CaF2:0.4 mol%PbF2 sample (Fig. 10).
Fig. 10. Comparison of the γ- and x-rays induced optical absorption bands of different PbF2 concentrations doped CaF2 samples.
The variation of the peaks positions and intensities shows that some of the color centers induced by the irradiation have been converted in time. Electrons released from one type center may be trapped by other defect sites to form other centers and vice versa. Type conversion of color centers has been reported too (Chen et al., 1998) in alkaline halides.
An interesting behavior has the peak at 306 nm (the characteristic peak of the Pb2+ ions). After 1 h of x-rays exposure, the 306 peak intensity decreases (as for the γ- rays irradiated CaF2:0.4 mol% PbF2 sample) then increases and of the 289 nm peak (associated to the Pb3+ ions) slightly increases. In Fig. 11 are shown the additional absorption for three stages of the irradiation: (1) after 3 h′ exposure to x-rays, (2) after 5 days and (3) after 80 days of the irradiation (the sample was kept in the dark). We can see the conversion of the various color centers formed during the initial stage of irradiation, especially those connected with the II band and that connected with the A band (306 nm). After 3 h exposure to x-rays, the intensity of A band decreases because part of Pb2+ ions have been converted in Pb3+, Pb0 and Pb+ ions. These ions create Pb0(2), Pb+(1) centers and Pb+(1) - Pb2+ dimers, with absorption bands in the range of the III band (Lohse et al., 1987, Fockele et al., 1989, Sastry and Kennedy, 1996). After 5 days part of these centers are converted trapping electrons from the unstable centers

at room temperature (Arends, 1968), such as MF (370 nm, I band) and the II band centers (M-518 nm and F-580 nm), whose intensities decrease, restoring in part the concentration of Pb2+. As a result, the additional absorption of the A band increases. This process continues in time. After 80 days, the II band pass away and the maximum of III band shifts to 730 nm. These facts indicate that the color centers formed in the first stage of the irradiation (at low radiation intensity) are converted in the prolonged irradiation and then in long time. This observation is valid for both gamma and x-rays irradiation.
Taking into account of this behavior, we can say that only the Pb+(1) - Pb2+ dimers (730 nm) and the F0i (407 nm) center are stable in time. In the case of the γ-irradiated CaF2:0.004 mol% PbF2 samples the valence conversion of the Pb2+ ions is not observable (the Pb2+ ions concentration is too low), the maximum of the second band peaked at 728 nm (see 3.1a). For the γ-irradiated CaF2:0.4 mol% PbF2 sample, the behavior of the valence change of the Pb2+ ions is the same as for the x-rays irradiated sample (see Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8).
3.2. Discussions
There are considerable deviations in the reported absorption spectra of the irradiated CaF2 crystals studied by different researchers depending upon the nature of impurities, method of preparation and nature of irradiation. The radiation induced absorption bands were discussed in detail by Scouler and Smakula (1960). In order to assign the observed bands to various color centers we took into account the published results. All the discussed bands were obtained by Gaussian multi-peak fit of the optical absorption spectra.
The main results about the gamma-rays induced color centers are summarized in Table 2. The band peaked at 323 (319) nm is associated to self-trapped hole, Vk center characteristic for irradiated CaF2 (Beaumont et al., 1970). In the absorption spectra, this band appears as a shoulder (see Fig. 2, Fig. 7). The Vk center is a hole stabilized between adjacent fluorine ions with an absorption band near 320 nm (Cooke and Bennett, 2003) and can remain stable up to room temperature if is stabilized by cation vacancies. Sunta (1984) summarizes the various types of modified Vk centers, which are stable above room temperature. The peak at 336 nm is associated with the Pb0(2) center. The 366 nm band is associated to the MF center (Beaumont and Hayes, 1969). The absorption band of F centers is located at 376 nm, although the calculations of Bartram et al. (1971) indicated at 353 nm and at 388 nm by Cavenett et al. (1969). In many cases the F band is overlapped with the short-wavelength bands of F aggregate centers (M, R and N centers) and is impossible to reliable identify F centers in our samples. The occurrence of F centers cannot be excluded. Scouler and Smakula (1960) ascribed the 400 nm absorption band to a hole connected with a neutral fluorine atom in interstitial position located in the center of the cube formed by the sublattice of eight fluorine ions. Cai and Song (1995), Bennewitz et al. (1997) detected neutral F atoms in CaF2 crystals. The bands peaked at 416 and 405 nm are assigned to this center, denoted as Fi0 center. The weak 580 nm band is correlated with electrons trapped in F- ion vacancies (F centers) (Scouler and Smakula, 1960). The broad band with maximum intensity at 727 nm is probably a superposition of many bands corresponding to the F-aggregates centers (M, R, N), colloidal centers (Shcheulin et al., 2015, Nambi and Higashimura, 1971) and lead centers {Pb0(2), Pb+(1) and Pb+(1)-Pb2+ dimers} (Lohse et al., 1987; Fockele et al., 1989). The band peaked at 727 nm attributed to Pb+(1) - Pb2+ dimers is denoted (P-P). When doped crystals are exposed to different radiation, some of the induced color centers are the same as in the undoped crystals, some are slightly modified by the impurities, and some are characteristic of impurity itself. In the case of lead doped CaF2 crystals, the assigned Vk, Fi0, M and F centers are characteristic for undoped CaF2 and they were attributed taking into account the published results. Gamma or x-rays irradiation of the samples produces Pb+ as well as Pb3+ and Pb0 ions. Depending on the position in CaF2 lattice, these ions create various lead centers with characteristic absorption bands (Fockele et al., 1989). These color centers are due the impurity (Pb) itself and change the structure of the absorption spectra of our samples compared with those published in the literature for gamma irradiated CaF2. We assigned the observed absorption peaks taking into account the Fockele results. The Pb+(1)-Pb2+ (P-P) dimers does are not really clusters that appear at increased impurities concentration, they are rather aggregates. They appear because due to the irradiation some of Pb2+ ions became Pb+ and creates these dimers even at low Pb concentration. The intensity of their absorption band depends on the concentration”.
In the case of x-rays irradiated sample, the weak band at 321 nm is associated to Vk center; this band disappears after 5 days. The 342 nm peak correspond to Pb0(2) center, the weak band peaked at 372 nm is attributed partly due to F centers, this band pass away after 5 days. The band at 409 nm is assigned to Fi0 center. The M center consists of a pair of F centers with maximum optical absorption near 520 nm (Beaumont and Hayes, 1969, Cooke and Bennett, 2003). We attributed the band at 515–518 nm at M centers and that at 582 nm is correlated with F centers. The broad band with maximum peak at 767 nm is attributed to lead centers (Lohse et al., 1987, Fockele et al., 1989).
A comparison of gamma- and x-rays induced optical absorption bands of different PbF2 concentrations doped CaF2 samples is shown in Fig. 10. The spectra are quite similar in band structure. Except for the characteristic A band (307 nm) of the Pb2+ ions, the two broad bands, denoted by I and III, are the radiation induced absorption bands. The structure of these bands is almost the same, the peaks positions some of them differ a little (see Table 2). Besides the irradiation dose, the absorption bands intensity (corresponding to various color centers), depends on the Pb2+ ions concentration (for the lowest PbF2 concentration sample we used different scales in the graphs). The important result of these studies is that even at trace amount of Pb2+ ions in CaF2 crystals, stable color centers are formed after gamma or x-rays irradiation.
4. Conclusions
Pure and PbF2 doped CaF2 crystals were obtained in our crystal research laboratory. The influence of PbF2 concentration on the color centers induced by gamma and x-rays irradiation was studied. Two broad absorption bands with maxima peaked at 410 and 730 nm appear in the optical absorption spectra. The structure of our spectra differs from those reported in the literature mainly by the broad band centered at 730 nm. The spectra of our samples are quite similar in band structure for all samples and for the both types of irradiations. Different bands showed different responses to the irradiation and to the long-term recovery. The absorption spectra of the x-rays irradiated sample became stable after 80 days; some of the peaks disappear, because some color centers are converted. The absorption bands induced by the γ-rays remain stable after the exposure to the radiations. The most stable color centers are (Fi0) and the dimer P-P (Pb+(1)-Pb2+). The absorption bands intensity depends on the radiation dose and on the PbF2 concentration. The colorless samples turned green after irradiation. The optical properties of the γ-irradiated CaF2 crystals are significantly affected even by the presence of trace quantities (at the 40 ppm level) of lead ions.
The significant results found in the present work are those shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 10 and 11. They indicate that: (i) the γ or x-rays induced absorption bands due to the presence of Pb2+ ions in CaF2 are similar, regardless of the Pb ions concentration (Fig. 1 and 10); only the intensity of the bands depends on the concentration. The absorption bands differ from those of the irradiated pure CaF2. (ii) The color centers formed in the first stage of the x-rays irradiation and of the γ-rays at low radiation intensity are converted in the prolonged irradiation and then in long time (Fig. 11). (iii) The two broad absorption bands induced by the γ-rays remain stable even for trace amount of Pb2+ ions, therefore CaF2:PbF2 is not a good material for applications in which the new optical absorption bands are undesirable. Since a PbF2 addition is used to obtain pure or doped CaF2 crystals, Pb2+ ions can remain in the obtained crystals. The use of these crystals for various purposes should take into account the undesirable effects caused by these impurities.
