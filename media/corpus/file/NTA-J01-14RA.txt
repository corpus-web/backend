ABSTRACT
Nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES) have potential to capitalize on (1) producing multiple commodities,
i.e. electricity and hydrogen as well as (2) allowing  for  electricity  grid  load  following,  with  hydrogen  production during low electricity prices. Using nuclear thermal energy and electricity (from the reactor itself) makes hydrogen production an economically attractive option. The reactor can continuously operate at full capacity, sending excess heat and electricity towards hydrogen production, which could either be sold or  converted back to electricity using fuel cells at high  price  times.  Several  hydrogen  production  technologies  exist, but in this study the focus is on processes that require heat and electricity. These  candidates  include alkaline water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC), thermochemical sulfur–iodine (S–I), calcium-bromide (Ca-Br) cycles, hybrid sulfur (HyS) and copper–chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycles. Each have different minimum temperature requirements which can be coupled to Generation       III and IV reactor outlet temperatures: low (<300 ◦C), medium (<750 ◦C), and high (<950 ◦C). Energy input       and material process  flow  diagrams  were  created  for  all  technologies  at  compatible  reactor  temperatures  and compared to the most common commercially operating hydrogen production method: steam methane reforming (SMR). Technology readiness levels (TRLs) and costs were also compared. The TRL of most systems      is still below commercial development, and hydrogen productions costs are still  too  high  to  be  economic  without additional policy and/or other developments.

1.Introduction
Hybrid nuclear energy systems utilize multiple energy resources to couple multiple subsystems and produce energy commodities as out- puts (Antkowiak et al., 2012). This allows a nuclear energy system to operate at full capacity and either produce electricity for grid base-load power or use excess heat and electricity to produce a new commodity. As climate change advances due to increases in greenhouse gases, the need for renewable, cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels becomes more urgent. Pollutants from fossil fuels are already estimated to be high enough to affect public health and the environment specifically at high density populations within the US (Holladay et al., 2009). Hydrogen (H2) fuel is a potential commodity that is clean, renewable and can be produced using thermal energy from a nuclear plant.
Hydrogen is a promising alternative fuel (Holladay et al., 2009).     It has the highest energy content compared to any other known fuel,  as shown in Table 1 (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). However,
hydrogen is not readily available in nature, despite the fact that it is by far the most abundant element in the universe, and must be produced from a variety of different methods (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). These methods can include fossil fuel based hydrogen production, biomass based hydrogen, and hydrogen from water, requiring heat and electricity (Holladay et al., 2009).
Hydrogen may be safely stored and transported through conven- tional means. It may be stored as a compressed gas, cryogenic liquid   or solid hydride (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). It can then produce energy from fuel cells or used as a fuel for transportation, heating, metal production (such as the reduction of iron oxide to iron), or pro- duction of gasoline, methanol, ethanol, ammonia, and other high value chemicals (Holladay et al., 2009; Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). As of 2017 the annual production of H2 reached 0.1 GT, used mainly for petroleum refining and treating metals, with a small fraction for fueling cars (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The demand for hydrogen fuel

is expected to increase over the next few decades (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017; El-Shafie et al., 2019).
Coupling hydrogen production to a nuclear energy system offers      a multitude of advantages. Politically, the inconsistency of importing fossil fuels can lead to increases in prices and uncertainty in energy sup- ply. Environmentally, hydrogen does not emit greenhouse gases when combusted or produced from greenhouse gas free sources (i.e. produced using heat and electricity from solar or nuclear and producing hydrogen from water or biomass). Hydrogen has the potential to provide clean, domestic energy for increased economic and energy security (Holladay et al., 2009).
Current nuclear reactors operate for base load electricity produc- tion, which accounts for 60% of electricity demand (Antkowiak et al., 2012). However, the other 40% requires  systems  that  can  operate  for load-following conditions. This is because renewable energies such as solar and wind peak at certain times (i.e. solar increases substan- tially during the middle of the day), which can lead to volatile daily prices (Forsberg, 2019). The prices can fluctuate to negative values during high renewable capacities (Forsberg, 2019). Fig. 1 shows the negative electricity prices arising from increased renewable (solar) energy in California over the course of a day (Forsberg, 2019). In these cases, capacity payments may be required to keep generator systems online when there is low wind or solar input (Forsberg, 2019). As re- newable energy increases, the fraction of base-load energy will shrink, and more effort will be placed load-following technologies. Nuclear systems alone are not economically effective when participating in this load following structure, because they would not consistently able to operate at full capacity. Thus, producing other commodities, such as hydrogen, will provide another lucrative option and make the whole system more economically attractive.
The nuclear reactor coupled to hydrogen production has the poten- tial for higher overall energy use efficiency and better utilization of capital equipment (Antkowiak et al., 2012). This is because the nuclear reactor can operate at full capacity, but also follow the electricity grid as it varies throughout the day. When electricity prices are low, or negative, the reactor can use a subsystem to convert heat or electricity
into hydrogen. This hydrogen may then be converted back to energy during times of high electricity demand using fuel cells or be sold as    its own commodity. Fig. 2 shows the routes a  nuclear  reactor  may take for hydrogen production, depending on available reactor outlet temperature.
As stated previously, there are a multitude of ways hydrogen may be produced. The focus of this paper is on renewable hydrogen production from water that requires  only  excess  heat  and  electricity  that  can  be produced from the thermal energy of a nuclear reactor. These water-based hydrogen production technologies are also compared to the most common method of hydrogen production today — steam methane reforming, which is used in approximately 48% of current production (Department of Energy (DOE) Office of  Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2019). This method requires fossil fuels for production and therefore releases greenhouse gases including carbon
dioxide (CO2).
The temperature of the water is also an important consideration. Nuclear reactors have outlet temperatures that vary from approxi- mately 300 to 950 ◦C, depending on the design (Forsberg, 2019; Goldberg and Rosner, 2011). Generation III reactors primarily consist of Light Water Reactors (LWRs), which are the predominant reactor in the United States. These are considered low temperature reactors and have outlet temperatures estimated at 300 ◦C. Generation IV reactors are pushing on the average outlet temperature. For the purpose of analysis, the LWR and Generation IV reactors have been split into three categories: low (<300 ◦C), medium (<750 ◦C), and high (<950
◦C, though realistically likely <900 ◦C) outlet temperatures. The outlet
temperature can determine what hydrogen production methods are fea- sible. Table 2 includes a summary of the three temperature categories, including reactor type, outlet temperature, and average plant size. Note that the conversion from thermal to electric power is estimated at 40% for this and all further analysis. This efficiency could be achieved by advanced reactors, whereas for the LWRs the efficiency varies between
30 to 33%. Also note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the potential concepts, but shows that reactors are being designed in all three different temperature ranges.
This paper offers an overview of hydrogen production technologies, with a focus on water-based hydrogen production methods. It also includes an overview of storage and potential uses of hydrogen, such   as for fuel  or  conversion  back  to  electricity.  Finally,  a  comparison is made on several hydrogen production methods, including steam methane reforming, thermochemical water splitting, water electrolysis, and hybrid technologies. This comparison includes the technological readiness levels, hydrogen costs, and heat and electricity requirements for  all  methods.  It  also  includes  a  comparison  of  methods  for high
(<950 ◦C), medium (<750 ◦C), and low (<300 ◦C) water temperature
inputs to indicate possible hydrogen production methods for several reactor classifications.
2.Hydrogen production technologies overview
A brief review of current and future hydrogen production methods is discussed. The majority of current hydrogen production technology comes from fossil fuel production. 96% of commercial hydrogen comes from a combination of natural gas (48%), heavy oils and naptha (30%), and coal (18%), which are mainly reformed using steam methane reforming (SMR) (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017; Department of En- ergy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2019). The other 4% of hydrogen production comes from water electrolysis using alkaline electrolyzers, a renewable technology (Zeng and Zhang, 2010). Hydrogen production can be divided into production from fossil fuels and production from renewable resources. Renewable resources include both biomass hydrogen production and water splitting. Table 3 includes a summary of current and developed hydrogen production technologies, feedstock, operating temperature range, efficiency, and developmental stage.

Note that ‘‘near term’’ estimates less than 5 years, ‘‘medium term’’ 5–10 years, and ‘‘long term’’ greater        than 10 years  to  commercial  maturity  (Holladay  et  al.,  2009;  Nikolaidis  and  Poullikkas,  2017;  El-Shafie  et  al.,  2019;  Rashid  et  al.,  2015;  Dagle  et  al.,  2017;  Schmidt et al., 2017).
2.1.Production from fossil fuel reforming
Fossil fuel hydrogen production technologies are commercially available or developed and cheap due to low fossil fuel costs (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The main fossil fuel technology is hydrocarbon reforming, in which a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas and coal,   is converted through various reforming technologies into hydrogen,
carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, and other byproducts. Methane fuel pro- cessing (from natural gas) is the most common commercial hydrogen production method (Holladay et al., 2009). The biggest challenge to hydrocarbon reforming processes comes from the catalyst poisoning due to sulfur, which is contained in most hydrocarbon fuels (Holladay et al., 2009).
The main hydrocarbon reforming processes consist of SMR, partial oxidation (POX), and autothermal reforming (ATR). In  the  reform- ing process, hydrocarbons react with either steam in an endothermic process (in SMR process), oxygen in an exothermic reactor (in POX pro- cess), and both reactions combined for ATR (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The reactions all produce CO, so they all undergo a water-gas- shift reaction to convert the CO into CO2  and H2  (see SMR section    for details). SMR has the advantages of extensive commercialization, no pure oxygen required (only steam), lower process temperatures, and high H2 to CO ratios relative to the other hydrocarbon reforming methods (Holladay et al., 2009). However, SMR has the highest air emissions. A further description of the SMR process is provided in the following section. POX, also a commercially available technology, has been proposed to produce hydrogen for automobile fuel cells and com- mercial applications (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). This process has a slightly lower efficiency than SMR based on methane’s higher heating value (see Table 3). Since POX consists of a reforming reaction that is exothermic, coke and hot spot formation are prevalent which makes thermal management difficult (Holladay et al., 2009; El-Shafie et al., 2019). Additionally, POX is capital intensive since the process requires pure oxygen (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). However, POX is the best hydrocarbon reforming process to produce hydrogen from heavy feedstocks such as coal and heavy oil residues (Nikolaidis and Poul- likkas, 2017). Autothermal reforming combines the benefits of both SMR and POX: it uses heat from the exothermic POX reaction to assist in the endothermic SMR reaction to increase the H2/CO ratio (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). ATR is not at  the  commercial  stage  yet  but will have lower investments costs than SMR or POX, a lower operating temperature than POX, and the potential for rapid stop and start times when it is (Holladay et al., 2009; Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017).
Other fossil fuel-based hydrogen technologies include pyrolysis, plasma reforming, aqueous phase reforming, and ammonia reforming. None of these technologies have reached commercial maturity. Pyroly- sis is the process in which a hydrocarbon is decomposed into hydrogen and carbon in the absence of water or oxygen. It can be done with biomass/organic material and is used for producing carbon nanotubes and spheres (Holladay et al., 2009). Pyrolysis has the advantage of simplicity, as it does not require processing steps such as water gas shift and CO2 removal, making it cheaper to produce hydrogen (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). However, any water or oxygen in the process may be detrimental causing excess CO and CO2  emissions, and the     H2  separation process may be expensive due to the low proportion     of hydrogen in the mixture (Holladay et al., 2009; Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017).
Plasma reforming includes the same reactions as hydrocarbon re- forming, but energy and radicals are provided by a plasma (Holladay  et al., 2009). Developed plasma reforming technology has the potential to decrease costs, decrease deterioration of catalysts, decrease reactor size and weight, increase response time, and increase the ability to effectively reform heavy hydrocarbons (Holladay et al., 2009). Since only free radicals are increased in temperature, overall reaction tem- peratures may be lower. However, high electricity requirements and electrode erosion prove challenging for this technology (Holladay et al., 2009). Plasma reforming is subdivided into two categories: thermal and non-thermal plasma. Thermal plasma involves raising temperature of both free radicals and neutral species  to  elevated  temperatures,  and therefore has high power requirements (El-Shafie et al., 2019). Non-thermal plasma reforming involves increasing only the temper- ature of electrons,  keeping  neutral  gas  temperature  low.  There  are a few non-thermal plasma techniques: gliding arc plasma, dielectric
barrier discharge, microwave plasma, and corona discharge, and these
In developed aqueous phase reforming, hydrogen is produced from oxygenated hydrocarbons or carbohydrate at low temperatures (220– 270 ◦C), and pressures of 25–30 MPa (Holladay et al., 2009). Because this technique operates at low temperatures, a water gas shift reactor can be combined with the reforming reactor for simplicity (Holladay   et al., 2009). Future research efforts are focused on improving catalyst technology to prevent methanation and decreasing reactor size (due to moderate space time yields) (Holladay et al., 2009).
Ammonia reforming utilizes ammonia instead of hydrocarbons (Hol- laday et al., 2009). Ammonia is made from nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3), and the reforming allows for the recovery of previously stored hydrogen. It has been proposed as a method for portable fuel cell applications due to the extensive pipelines of ammonia that already exist (as ammonia is a common fertilizer) (Holladay et al., 2009). Ammonia reforming has low cost and a low environmental impact (El- Shafie et al., 2019). It may be directly coupled with a high temperature fuel cell, or decomposed in a plasma reactor (El-Shafie et al., 2019).
2.1.1.Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)
SMR is the largest, most commercially developed hydrogen produc- tion technology. For this reason, an in-depth process is described and this method will be compared to potential nuclear hybrid technologies. An overview of this process is shown in Fig. 3.
Natural gas or other methane containing hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane, or light and heavy naptha are first sent to either a steam system to combust, heating steam, or a sulfur removing device (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The sulfur remov- ing process is important because sulfur can poison catalysts in the reformer and be detrimental to the reactions. Sulfur removal is typically done either with chemical reactions or adsorptive technology. The main commercial approach is the use of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) chemical reactions (Holladay et al., 2009). In HDS, catalysts hydrogenate the sulfur bearing molecules to release H2S (Holladay et al., 2009). A common adsorptive technique is using activated carbon to absorb the sulfur (Holladay et al., 2009).
Steam from the steam system and clean methane (CH4) then go     to a reformer, where a catalyst activates the following endothermic reaction:
@1
Catalysts may be non-precious metals (such as nickel) or Group  VIII precious metals such as platinum or rhodium (Holladay et al., 2009). Nickel catalysts are typically  used  in  industry  because  they  do not limit the reaction and are cheaper (Holladay et al., 2009).  Other alkaline components may be added to the catalyst to suppress coke formation (Holladay et al., 2009). Additionally, to suppress coke formation the reaction takes place at high temperatures (700–1000 ◦C), pressures up to 3.5 MPa and steam to carbon ratios of 3.5 (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Once reformed, the syngas made of CO and H2 are conditioned in a water-gas-shift reactor. Here, water and CO are reacted with a catalyst to create more hydrogen and CO2 (Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2019). This is shown in the following reaction:
@2
The CO2 and other impurities are removed in a process called pressure-swing adsorption to leave nearly pure hydrogen (Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2019). Excess water is treated and cooled, and may be recycled back into the steam system. Additionally, CO2  may be captured via a carbon capture and storage system, where the CO2 may be stored in a geologic reservoir or under water to reduce greenhouse gas emission to the at- mosphere. Based on the HHV of methane, SMR has efficiencies between 74% and 85% (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017).

2.2.Production from renewable resources
Although hydrogen production from renewable resources is cur- rently low, it is expected to dominate over conventional technologies  in the long term (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The two main methods of producing hydrogen come from biomass and water splitting. Biomass is the second largest renewable resource, under hydropower, in the United States and will likely become the main substitute to petroleum (Holladay et al., 2009). Biomass consists of a wide array     of sources such as animal residue, plant residue, sawdust, aquatic plants, waste paper, grasses, wood, and much more (Holladay et al., 2009; Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). CO2 is released during biomass hydrogen production, but only in the amount absorbed by organisms
while they were still living, which is considerably smaller in magnitude than fossil fuels (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017).
Biomass hydrogen production processes can be further subdivided into biological and thermochemical processes. Thermochemical pro- cesses include biomass gasification and others, such as pyrolysis, com- bustion, and liquefaction. Biological processes include photolysis, dark and photo fermentation, and microbial electrolysis cells. Thermochem- ical biomass production is predominantly gasification, a mature and commercially available technology (Holladay et al., 2009). In gasifi- cation, biomass is converted into a hydrogen-rich gas in the presence of oxygen or air with the use of catalysts (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Gasification produces methane and CO, which can be further converted into hydrogen with SMR and water gas shift reactors (Niko- laidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Biomass gasification has relatively low thermal efficiencies due to moisture that must be vaporized in the biomass (Holladay et al., 2009). It also can suffer from  increased  costs due to the necessity of cleaning large amounts of tar produced    in gasification as well as large amounts of resources spent gathering biomass for commercial-scale production (Holladay et al., 2009).
Biological processes, on the other hand, are still early in the de- velopmental stage. They use organic material (micro-organisms) that consume water and produce hydrogen. Biological processes have the main disadvantage of low production and yield rates (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Researchers continue to discover and develop micro- organisms to advance biological processes (Holladay et al., 2009).
Within biological hydrogen production, there is photolysis, dark fer- mentation, photo fermentation, and microbial electrolysis cells. Photol- ysis utilizes the fact that some micro-organisms, such as green algae and cyanobacteria, produce hydrogen with excess solar energy (Holladay  et al., 2009). It only requires water and sunlight, which is inexpensive and globally available (Holladay et al., 2009). However, a large sur- face area is required to collect enough sunlight, and organisms cease producing hydrogen in the presence of oxygen (a by-product of water splitting) (Holladay et al., 2009). Efficiencies are also theoretically limited to less than 1% (Holladay et al., 2009).
Dark fermentation uses anaerobic bacteria, in the dark, under oxy- gen free conditions, to ferment carbohydrate rich substrates (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Pure, simple sugars such as glucose is a pre- ferred substrate, but is relatively expensive and unavailable in large quantities (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). An advantage of dark fermentation is that space is not an issue, as no light is required
for a continuous stream of hydrogen to be produced (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Alternatively, photo fermentation (also known as photosynthetic bacterial hydrogen production), utilizes purple non- sulfur bacteria on the nitrogenase functionality (Holladay et al., 2009). Similar to photolysis, the bacteria produce hydrogen with sunlight, though in this case through fermentation. The advantage of photo fer- mentation over photolysis is that oxygen does not inhibit the reaction, however, the fermentation process is slow and requires a relatively high amount of energy (Holladay et al., 2009).
Microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) decompose biological material directly through electrohydrogenesis. MEC is a modified microbial fuel cell, where an external voltage is applied to the cell, in an anaerobic state, for acetate substrate decomposition (Holladay et al., 2009). The minimum theoretical applied voltage for this process is 0.11 V, but practically is likely greater than 0.3 V due to ohmic resistance and electrode overpotentials (Holladay et al., 2009). Complexity is high in these cells due to excess methane produced that must be intermittently removed (Holladay et al., 2009).
Finally, water splitting processes can be divided into three group: water electrolysis, thermochemical water splitting, and photoelectro- chemical water splitting (PEC), also known as photoelectrolysis. Water splitting is the cleanest hydrogen production method as there are no greenhouse gases emitted. These processes all utilize some method to split water in the following reaction:
@3
Water electrolysis is the process where a potential difference is placed between two electrodes, in an electrolyte, to break apart water into its components. Electrolysis is the reverse process of the fuel cell, in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity and water. Electrolysis requires a source of water, which is inexpensive,  and electricity. Commercial products exist, which are made of alkaline electrolyzers (Holladay et al., 2009). Alkaline electrolysis breaks liquid water apart. Developed electrolysis methods include proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, which also operates in the liquid water region, and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC), or high temperature electrolysis, which operates with steam (700–1000 ◦C)  (Nikolaidis  and Poullikkas, 2017). High temperature electrolysis is less expensive than other electrolysis methods. In SOEC, part of the electrical energy requirement is replaced with thermal to achieve the required steam temperature. High electrolysis costs, due to the electricity requirement, currently prevent electrolysis from dominating hydrogen production on a large scale (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). High pressure elec- trolyzers are currently being developed to reduce costs of compressing hydrogen post-electrolysis (Holladay et al., 2009). Due to the poten- tial of electrolysis methods in production of H2, an in-depth process diagram of each electrolysis method is studied in this effort.
Thermochemical water splitting involves using only heat to split water. Based on the Gibbs free energy to split water in a single step   Eq. (3), the minimum temperature required to create hydrogen is over 1700 ◦C for partial dissociation, and over 4000 ◦C for total dissoci- ation (Grimes et al., 2007). This temperature is extremely high for most heat sources, so there has been heavy development in creating multiple step cycles to reduce reaction temperatures. These cycles
produce hydrogen and oxygen and recycle the chemicals through the steps. Thus far, over 100 cycles in over 800 literature papers have been identified, operating at a multitude of temperature ranges at various stages of development (Rosen, 2010). The lower temperature cycles may achieve minimum temperatures around 500 ◦C while others have a maximum temperature over 1000 ◦C. Cycles of interest to nuclear hybrid technology will be further discussed in the Nuclear Hybrid Candidates section. These cycles are more developed and have been hypothesized to work with reactors already, including the sulfur–iodine and calcium–bromine cycles (Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006; McKellar, 2010). Additionally, beyond a simple thermochemical cycle involving only water and heat, hybrid processes where one step involves electrolysis have also been developed. The main hybrid processes in focus are the hybrid sulfur cycle and copper–chlorine cycle.
PEC or photoelectrolysis is another developed process which only requires water and sunlight. In PEC, sunlight is absorbed in semicon- ductor materials, and if the photon has an energy greater than the bandgap, and electron–hole pair is created which splits water into its components (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). The minimum voltage required is 1.23 V, based on the Gibbs free energy of liquid water. A high bandgap energy is necessary to split the water which can decrease overall efficiency (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Efficiency is also decreased due to imperfections in semiconductor crystalline struc-  ture (Holladay et al., 2009). Additionally, high costs are involved given limitations in semiconductor materials and efficiencies (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017).
All hydrogen production technologies previously discussed are shown in Table 3. Although any of these processes that require either heat or electricity could be coupled to a nuclear reactor, the main interest is generating clean, efficient energy when coupled to the reactor. Therefore, the main interest is in water splitting, specifically electrolysis and thermochemical water production.
3.Hydrogen for energy storage
Once hydrogen is produced, it may either be used for energy storage and eventually converted back to heat or electricity, or as an energy carrier, as shown in Fig. 2. For energy storage, fuel cells are the solution. Fuel cells are clean sources of flexible power, either heat or electricity, are silent, and have relatively high energy efficiencies (Rand and Dell, 2007; Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Fuel cells include an electrolyte to conduct ions, a positive and negative electrode, a plate    to connect cells, and current collectors.  Stacks of fuel  cells are used   to generate a desired amount of power, ranging from a few watts to multi-MW, which allows them to be extremely versatile.
Fuel cells are essentially  the  opposite  of  electrolysis,  as  it  takes in oxygen and hydrogen and produces water and power. In fact, de- velopment of fuel cells is beneficial to both technologies. As shown      in the Nuclear Hybrid Candidates section on water electrolysis, fuel cells may simply run in reverse of electrolyzers. Alkaline electrolyte (AFC), proton-exchange membrane (PEMFC) fuel cells, and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), all share similar names, properties, and temperature ranges as their electrolysis counterparts. Alternative fuel cells exist that can take in non-hydrogen fuel, such as the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) which takes methanol as input (Rand and Dell, 2007).
For energy storage, the AFC, PEMFC, and SOEC are ideal for nuclear-hydrogen systems. This is because they use the same materials as their electrolysis cells. Therefore, electrolysis can take place in the same cell during times of low electricity, hydrogen and oxygen (or air) stored for future use, and then be used as fuel cells to create electricity to supply to the grid. AFC and PEMFC, both of which have been commercially developed (though less developed for PEMFCs) report low start-up times (less than 10 min), enabling a quick switch to energy production (Rand and Dell, 2007). However, the SOFC still reports long start up times (1-5 h), which is a potential problem for quick switches (Rand and Dell, 2007). SOFCs are still in the developmental
stage, like the SOECs. An additional problem is poisoning via CO2 (due to impure inputs), which can include a cost penalty. AFC and PEMFC are susceptible to this CO2 poisoning (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). SOFC has fewer problems with impurities, but faces a wide array of materials challenges due to their high operating temperatures (700– 1000 ◦C) (Rand and Dell, 2007). The overall efficiency of converting energy from a nuclear plant to hydrogen and back to electricity through a fuel cell could be as low as 12% due to energy conversion losses, elec- trolyzer and fuel cell efficiencies, and losses in hydrogen compression and electricity transmission/distribution (Rand and Dell, 2007).
Fuel cells may be supplied by pipelined hydrogen or directly from hydrogen on site (Rand and Dell, 2007). The hydrogen generated in a nuclear plant may have a fuel cell directly attached to produce elec- tricity to the grid during times of high electricity costs. Alternatively, the hydrogen produced at a nuclear plant may be pipelined and sent to fuel cells in other areas to produce heat and/or electricity at a specific location.
Storage of hydrogen is generally simpler for energy storage ap- plications when compared to energy carrying (propulsion) applica- tions (Rand and Dell, 2007). It also is cheaper to store bulk hydrogen from large centralized plants (up to four times cheaper than distributed plants, approximately 100 times smaller) (Rand and Dell, 2007).
To store hydrogen, it must be compressed, typically anywhere from 20 to 80 MPa. This may be done adiabatically, isothermally, or in a multi-stage process (Rand and Dell, 2007). A multi-stage process will likely require an energy input of around 10% of the HHV to compress to 50 MPa, corresponding to potentially large ( 20%) electrical en-  ergy losses in the system (Rand and Dell, 2007; Bossel and Eliasson, 2003). Adiabatic compression requires more energy than multistage, and isothermal requires less for all pressures (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003).
There may be diffusion problems with compression, as H2 is the smallest molecule and therefore has relatively high diffusivity. Al- ternative storage methods include liquefaction, which can have high energy penalties (21% of HHV for large capacity plants (greater than 1000 kg H2/hr), and up to 110%, greater than the HHV of hydrogen,  for advanced 1 kg/hr plants), storing hydrogen in a metal hydride (which has several pending heat transfer engineering problems), or chemical storage (which may be expensive or require high tempera- tures) (Rand and Dell, 2007; Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005; Bossel and Eliasson, 2003). However, economies of scale exist that can reduce liquefaction capital costs by a factor of 4 by increasing production by a factor of around 20 (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Fig. 4 compares the energy requirements for compression to 20 and 80 MPa adiabatically, isothermally, and in a multi-stage process with liquefaction energy penalties (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003).
4.Hydrogen  as  energy carrier
Hydrogen has been used as an energy carrier to propel spacecraft since the 1960s. Work is being developed to use hydrogen for other propulsion needs, such as transportation. Hydrogen cars offer a clean alternative to vehicles powered by petrol or diesel but is not  cur-  rently competitive due to lower performances (reduced efficiencies) and higher prices (Rand and Dell, 2007).
Hydrogen as a fuel is low density (0.09 kg/m3) at standard temper-
ature and pressure. It also has a low boiling point of 20.3 K (and liquid density of 70.8 kg/m3), requiring sophisticated technology to contain in this state. Hydrogen also has the highest standard heat of formation compared to other conventional fuels (higher heating value HHV) of
141.9 MJ/kg. However, due to the low density of hydrogen, higher volumes are required to reach HHV densities compared to compressed or liquified methane or petrol (Rand and Dell, 2007). For comparison, methane has a density of 0.72 kg/m3 and a HHV of 55.5 MJ/kg (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003).
Fig.  4.  Energy  comparison  (as a  %  of  H2  HHV)  for  several  hydrogen  storage methods (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003).
Hydrogen has several drawbacks as a fuel source. It can be excep- tionally dangerous if leaked into an enclosed space, as it takes only 1/14th the energy needed to ignite compared to natural gas, and the flame is nearly invisible (Rand and Dell, 2007). Special, expensive cryostat units are needed for liquid fuel storage with vacuum and multi- level insulation (Rand and Dell, 2007). The cost of this specialized equipment is one reason hydrogen has not advanced as a widely popular fuel beyond use in space exploration (Rand and Dell, 2007). However, given the use of hydrogen in space exploration, it is clearly possible to technologically manage handling and storage problems.
Fuel cells are not exclusively used for energy storage. They have been used to convert energy on  spacecraft  since  the  1960s  (Rand  and Dell, 2007). There have been significant efforts to develop fuel cells for propulsion, specifically focusing on automobiles (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Fuel cells have also been proposed for energy appli- cations ranging from submarines and aircraft to consumer electronics such as laptops. However, further development is necessary in the renewables sector of hydrogen production, otherwise hydrogen used   as an energy carrier will be produced from fossil fuels mitigating the purpose of using hydrogen as a clean energy source (Rand and Dell, 2007).
PEMFCs are the proposed fuel cell of choice for transportation initiatives (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Currently, PEMFC stack costs exceed US $2000/kW, which must be lowered to around $50/kW (auto- motive costs, not stationary generation costs) to be competitive (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). It has been estimated that a current reduction to
$100/kW is feasible (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Fuel cells also need to improve durability and reliability before they are ready for commer- cial transportation (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). The goal is mobile operation of 3000–5000 h for cars and 20,000 h for buses (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005).
Storage of hydrogen for energy carrying applications are important, because the storage units must be small and light enough to be on     the vehicle. Currently, only the compressed gas storage method is practical for hydrogen fueled automobiles. Developments in composite containers, as opposed to steel, have been made but still have problems with high costs, energy penalties from compression, and safety issues (rapid loss of hydrogen) (Rand and Dell, 2007). The U.S., as of 2015, targeted 10.8 MJ/kg as a benchmark for vehicle storage as of 2015, a difficult target to meet (Rand and Dell, 2007).
Pipelining hydrogen also has challenges. While the hydrogen can  go through natural gas pipelines, there may be significant material degradation due to the use of high-carbon steel that hydrogen reacts with. Instead, new pipeline would likely need to be laid, consisting of low-carbon steel. This is an expensive task (Rand and Dell, 2007). Hy- drogen pipelines do currently exist, with several thousand km currently installed (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). Hydrogen fueling stations also currently exist, with 115 in the US as of 2005 (Rand and Dell, 2007). However, if hydrogen became widely used as a fuel for cars, new infrastructure would need to be in place, which could be 40%–50% more expensive than natural gas infrastructure (Rand and Dell, 2007). Additionally, hydrogen pipelines require significantly more energy per unit volume than natural gas pipelines, mainly for continual com- pression of the fuel. Around 1.4% of hydrogen flow in a pipe is lost per 150 km to energize compressors, compared to 0.3% of methane (natural gas) for the same energy flow (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003). This is an energy increase from natural gas pipelines by a factor of
4.7. The volumetric energy density of hydrogen is low, so for the same energy flow, 3.1 times the volumetric flow, and therefore more energy, is required compared to natural gas (Bossel and Eliasson, 2003). This is calculated from the volumetric HHV of hydrogen and methane, 12.7
MJ/m3 and 40.0 MJ/m3, respectively.
5.NHES hydrogen candidates
Reactor temperatures range from 300–950 ◦C for Generation III and IV reactors. These reactors may utilize excess heat and electricity dur- ing off peak times for the production of hydrogen. The main interests in producing hydrogen fall under water electrolysis, thermochemical water splitting, and a hybrid of the two systems. The next sections    will include background, processes, and assumptions used for modeling these candidates at various temperatures and power levels.
5.1.Water electrolysis
Water electrolysis, as mentioned previously, involves the decom- position of water into H2 and O2 Eq. (3). The reaction has specific energy requirements based on the temperature and pressure of the water. The Gibbs free energy change of water formation, 𝛥𝐺, enthalpy change of water formation 𝛥𝐻 , and entropy change 𝛥𝑆 (multiplied by temperature T) determine the minimum theoretical required voltage  to decompose water as a function of temperature and pressure (Santos et al., 2013):
@4
Note that the reactions taking place at the anode and cathode are dependent on the electrolysis type (materials based), but the overall reaction leads to the same overall voltage requirement.  Also  note  that, for simplicity of the electrolysis model, pressures are assumed     to be 1 atm. It is known that efficiencies decrease slightly (due to increased voltage requirements) for higher pressure systems but can lead to power savings because the hydrogen is produced at a higher pressure (Marangio et al., 2009). However, this analysis does not take into account energy required to compress and store hydrogen, only to produce it through various methods.
The Gibbs free energy determines the equilibrium cell voltage
𝐸𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑢𝑚,  or  the  absolute  minimum  voltage  required  for  electrolysis to occur, as shown in Eq. (5) (Zeng and Zhang, 2010):
@5
For water, n, the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction is 2 and F is the Faraday constant, at 96485 C/mol. At 25 ◦C,   1 atm (standard temperature and pressure), 𝛥𝐺 = 237.1 kJ/mol and
𝐸𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑢𝑚  =  1.23  V.  The  equilibrium  voltage  describes  the  minimum electrical energy demand for electrolysis. Fig. 5 shows how temperature effects Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy (O’Brien et al., 2010). Note  that  there  is  a  drop  in  energy  demand  once  water  becomes  a vapor. Also note that, at the equilibrium voltage, the reaction is endothermic and will not proceed without an additional heat source.

@11
@12
The total energy consumed per normal volume (at standard temper- ature and pressure) of hydrogen can also be calculated in the following equation (Guenot et al., 2015):
@13
where 𝑉𝑚 is the molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atm and 25 ◦C, equal to 0.0224 Nm3 (N stands for normal volume of ideal gas), and 𝑡 is the
number of seconds in an hour for conversion (equal to 3600), 𝐹 is the Faraday constant, and 𝑛 is 2 for the electrolysis process.
One important property of electrolysis, like with fuel cells, is the ability to stack and scale beyond one cell. A total number of cells can be estimated to give a total power and heat requirement and total hydrogen and oxygen production rates. Additionally, it should be noted that there is a heat requirement, estimated with 𝑇 𝛥𝑆, as well as an electricity requirement from the cell voltage. For alkaline and PEM electrolysis, the heat requirement already exists in the water, since these processes occur with liquid water, so only electrical energy must be provided. For SOEC, however, water must be converted to steam
and  elevated  to  700–1000  ◦C,  so  the  heat  requirement  may  not be
neglected. Since nuclear reactors provide heat and electricity, this is  not an issue for coupling SOEC.
The last important set of equations to model electrolysis are process efficiencies (Zeng and Zhang, 2010). There are a few efficiencies com- monly used. The faradic efficiency is the same as the voltage efficiency, and describes the ratio of voltage needed to split water based on Gibbs free energy to voltage needed for electrolysis:
Thermal efficiency is another measure of how well the electrolysis system works, and it measures the ratio of thermoneutral voltage, which is based on the enthalpy change of water decomposition, to the cell voltage.
@15
Finally, the efficiency can also be measured in terms of the higher heating value (HHV) of hydrogen. It is the ratio of power output (taken as the amount of power gotten from the amount of hydrogen produced
where and the HHV value) to power input for electrolysis (Kabza, 2010). This
is typically the quotable efficiency as it measures how efficient the system is at producing hydrogen. In these models the assumed conver- sion efficiency from heat to electricity is 40%. (McKellar, 2010). The hydrogen production efficiency, as shown in Eq. (16), is typically lower than the thermal or faradic efficiency due to electricity conversion efficiencies.
@16
The equations as described above provide the foundation for model- ing alkaline, PEM, and SOEC electrolysis. Each electrolysis process has specific processes, temperatures, and materials that change the inputs of ion exchange current density, running current density, and resistance into the model. It is assumed that the electrode area for all cells is    225 cm2 based on the model from Bragg-Sitton et al. (2014). The total power input is based on reactor size, and the total number of cells necessary to utilize this output is not necessary for comparison to other water splitting processes.
5.1.1.Alkaline electrolysis
Alkaline electrolysis, as stated previously, is the most commercially developed electrolysis method. It operates in the temperature range   of around 40–90 ◦C but has been quoted to operate as low as 20
◦C (Rashid et al., 2015; Sapountzi et al., 2017). In alkaline electrolysis,
water is split at the cathode and OH−travels to the anode (Holladay    et al., 2009), as shown in Eqs. (17) and (18).
@17
@18
Hydrogen is produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode. The product gases are separated by a diaphragm, which is permeable to   the OH−carrier as well as water (Carmo et al., 2013). The electrodes  are both submerged in a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte is a liquid and can either be potassium hydroxide KOH or sodium hydroxide NaOH, where KOH is the most common (Zeng and Zhang, 2010). While there are many electrode materials that work (such as cobalt or iron), nickel is the most popular due to its high activity and availability combined with low cost (Zeng and Zhang, 2010). The exchange current density 𝑖0  of nickel has been reported to be around 1.1*10−4  A/cm2     at the cathode (in a 50% KOH electrolyte at 80 ◦C) and  4.2*10−6  A/cm2   at the anode (Miles et al., 1976). These were the values used    to calculate anode and cathode overpotentials. Pressure operation can
Fig. 6. Schematic of Alkaline electrolysis.
5.1.2.Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, also known as polymer-electrolyte membrane electrolysis, uses a polymer electrolyte as opposed to a liquid as seen in alkaline electrolysis. It operates at similar temperatures, 20–100 ◦C, and converts liquid water (Rashid   et al., 2015). Recent developments have  been  investigated  to  oper- ate at temperatures around 200 ◦C for fuel cell applications, which translate to electrolysis applications (Sapountzi et al., 2017). PEM uses perfluorosulfonic acidic polymer solid electrolytes which also act as the membrane (Rashid et al., 2015). PEM electrolysis may be operated at high pressures, up to 40 MPa, which will lower the energy requirements for compressing hydrogen for storage (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005). These membranes allow for the proton, the charge carrier, to pass through while preventing other gases from moving. The reactions that occur in PEM are shown in Eqs. (19) and (20) (Holladay et al., 2009):
Anode:
2H2O → O2 + 4H+  + 4𝑒−	(19)
range from atmospheric to 12 MPa for advanced electrolyzers (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005).
The operational current density has been reported anywhere from
0.1 to 0.4 A/cm2   (Holladay et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2017; Carmo    et al., 2013). For modeling purposes, the current density was chosen   to be 0.3 A/cm2, as this was within the range quoted in the majority of the literature. The resistance 𝑅𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙  is difficult to calculate because it depends on the particular cell itself, but for the purpose of the model is estimated to be 0.2 Ω-cm (Santos et al., 2013). Not much more water than that used to produce hydrogen is needed as cooling is limited, given the low operational temperatures. The total water consumption has been estimated to be around 11.5 times the amount of hydrogen produced (Genovese et al., 2009).
A schematic of the alkaline electrolysis is shown in Fig. 6, including common materials.
Some advantages of alkaline electrolysis include stable, pure hydro- gen production (though slightly less pure than PEM) with non-noble catalysts, and mature technology (Carmo et al., 2013; Sapountzi et al., 2017). Suppliers of this electrolysis technology include De Nora SAP, Nel, Hydrogenics, Teledyne Energy Systems and General Electric (Sa- pountzi et  al.,  2017).  It  is  also  highly  scalable,  because  the  cells  are stackable. However, some disadvantages are corrosion from the electrolyte, gas permeation through the diaphragm, and slow dynam- ics (Sapountzi et al., 2017). It can also suffer from limited current densities and low pressure operation (in large scale units), forcing large volume designs (Rashid et al., 2015; Carmo et al., 2013).
Cathode:
2H+  + 2𝑒−  → H2	(20)
Electrodes are typical noble catalysts, typically  platinum  Pt  for the cathode and iridium Ir for the anode, which both  have  rela- tively high activity (Rashid et al., 2015). Other electrode materials include rhodium, rubidium, palladium, gold, and oxides of these cata- lysts (Rashid et al., 2015). The exchange current density at the cathode is estimated to be 1*10−3 A/cm2 and 1*10−7  A/cm2  at the  anode (Choi et al., 2004). A schematic of the overall PEM process is shown in Fig. 7.
PEM electrolyzers have low  ionic  resistances  which  allow  them  to operate at high current densities, anywhere between 0.6 and 3 A/cm2 (Holladay et al., 2009; Siracusano et al., 2018; Carmo et al., 2013). For modeling purposes, the current density was set at 2 A/cm2. High current density operation with relatively low ohmic resistances lead to high efficiencies and compact production rates. Literature val- ues of ohmic resistance were found as a function of temperature and estimated to be 0.2 Ω-cm at 30 ◦C, 0.1 Ω-cm at 60 ◦C, and 0.08 Ω-      cm at 90 ◦C (Siracusano et al., 2018). Like alkaline water electrolysis, the total water consumption was estimated around 11.5 times the amount of hydrogen produced, as little cooling is necessary during the process (Genovese et al., 2009).
There are several advantages of PEM electrolysis. The solid elec- trolyte allows for compact design and, combined with the high reactiv- ity of the electrodes, leads to fast response times (<10 min) (Boardman, 2017; Sapountzi et al., 2017). Highly pure hydrogen is also produced in

the process (Sapountzi et al., 2017). PEM cells are also highly scalable. On the downside, acidic electrodes cause degradation, limiting opera- tion lifetime, and the polymer membranes have high costs (Sapountzi et al., 2017). These are the main limitations to current widespread com- mercialization. However, up to MW-scale PEMs exist, by the company Proton OnSite (OnSite, 2019). Although PEM’s have been commercial- ized to the MW-scale, GW-scale PEMs are still in the research and development stage with a technology readiness level (TRL) of 4.
5.1.3.Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC)
SOEC operates close to the output temperatures of nuclear reactors, which gives this technology a unique advantage over its ambient temperature counterparts. It operates using steam and is sometimes called high temperature electrolysis (HTE), as opposed to liquid water, at temperatures between 700 and 1000 ◦C (Rashid et al., 2015). A solid electrolyte is also used, making SOEC compact and have quick response times like PEM electrolysis, though in this case the electrolyte is a ceramic. It is unique in that the high temperature requirements force a heat input as well as an electricity input. SOEC is the least developed electrolysis method, still in the bench scale. SOEC can be operated at pressures up to around 3 MPa (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005).
An oxygen ion is the energy carrier for the steam electrolysis reaction. The reactions that take place on the anode and cathode are shown in Eqs. (21) and (22) (El-Shafie et al., 2019):@21
@22
The most common electrode materials are nickel-zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet at the cathode and strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM), potentially with YSZ at the anode (O’Brien et al., 2010; Hauch, 2008). The exchange current densities for SOEC are much higher than previously seen electrodes at 2*10−1 A/cm2 for the Ni-YSZ cathode and 5.3*10−1 A/cm2 at the LSM/YSZ anode (Chan and Xia, 2002). Resis- tance ranges in literature from 0.25 to 0.4 Ω-cm (O’Brien et al., 2010; Bragg-Sitton et al., 2014), but a value of 0.4 Ω-cm was taken to mimic  a study done by Idaho National Laboratory (INL), in reference (Bragg- Sitton et al., 2014). The current density is typically somewhere between alkaline and PEM (0.3–1 A/cm2 (Gielen and Simbolotti, 2005)), and around 0.7 A/cm2 for the INL reference study (Bragg-Sitton et al., 2014). A large amount of water is required for SOECs, estimated at 83.3 times the hydrogen production, because of cooling (McKellar, 2010). The process diagram for SOEC is shown in Fig. 8.
Fig. 8. Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) or High Temperature Electrolysis (HTE) process.
SOEC is a promising technology with high application flexibility, high scalability, pure hydrogen (though less pure than other electrolysis methods due to residual steam) production, and enhanced reaction kinetics and thermodynamics at higher temperatures (reducing the equilibrium cell voltage) with low capital costs (Boardman, 2017; Sapountzi et al., 2017). Some disadvantages come in the form of degradation of electrodes and ceramic electrolyte at high temperature operation. This means low durability and lack of stability which must be improved before SOEC can become commercially available (Rashid et al., 2015; Sapountzi et al., 2017). Hydrogen is also the least pure      in this method (relative to electrolysis methods, due to residual steam in the system given the oxygen charge carrier). There is a developing technology which uses a solid ceramic membrane with steam (500– 1000 ◦C), with an H+ charge carrier like PEM, that can produce high purity hydrogen (Sapountzi et al., 2017). This technology is still  in early development and will not be  considered  for  further  analysis, but is a potential solution to produce pure hydrogen at lower steam temperatures.
5.2.Thermochemical water splitting
Thermochemical water splitting, as previously described, is one or more endothermic chemical reactions that require heat to split water. The two contenders considered for this study are the sulfur–iodine (S–I) and calcium-bromide (Ca–Br) cycles. Thermochemical cycles are less developed than electrolysis processes. In these cycles, chemicals are recycled throughout the  system,  so  inputs  and  outputs  consist  of water and water products, respectively. Though thermochemical cycles primarily utilize heat, rendering them more cost effective than electrolysis processes, they can face problems such as slow response rates, large size, and involve hazardous chemicals that may produce less pure hydrogen (Boardman, 2017).
5.2.1.Sulfur–iodine cycle (S–I)
The sulfur–iodine (S–I) cycle is the most developed thermochemical cycle, with a high interest pertaining to hybrid nuclear facilities. It was proposed by General Atomics in the mid-1970’s (Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006). Two proof of concept facilities and laboratory-scale experiments have been performed for this cycle (Ping et al., 2018). The S–I cycle  has been down-selected in the United States as well as other countries, such as Japan, as the most promising thermochemical cycle (El-Emam and Özcan, 2019; Varrin et al., 2011). The chemical reactions that take place in each step are shown in the following Ping et al. (2018) and Varrin et al. (2011):

carries hydrogen (Varrin et al., 2011). Mass balances and optimization
studies have been conducted for all reactions to maximize reaction rates and minimize undesired products from alternative reactions oc- curring (Ping et al., 2018). The S–I process can be seen in Fig. 9. Note that the decomposition reactions are both endothermic, but the Bunsen reaction is exothermic. The limiting reaction is the H2SO4 reaction, due to the high temperature requirements. This decomposition reaction is why the S–I process may only be coupled to high temperature nuclear reactors if no external heat is desired.
Calcium–bromine cycle (Ca–Br) or UT-3 cycle
The calcium–bromine (Ca–Br) cycle was discovered at the Univer- sity of Tokyo in Japan, which is why it  is  also  referred  to  as  the  UT-3 cycle (Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006). Whi le considered a promising candidate for nuclear hybrid processes, it is less technologically mature than its competitor, the S–I cycle, and therefore has not been further se- lected in down-selection processes (Varrin et al., 2011). The minimum temperature required for this process is around 760 ◦C (Sakurai et al., 1996), which potentially could be met with a high temperature reactor, and also a potential for medium temperature reactors with external heating. The UT-3 process can be divided into four chemical reactors  as shown in Fig. 10. A unique advantage of the UT-3 cycle is that it only involves solids and gases, which are easier to separate than the all liquid reagents of the S–I cycle (Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006).
The chemical reactions and temperatures required that take place in each reactor are shown in the following Sakurai et al. (1996) and   Teo et al. (2005):

5.3.Hybrid water splitting
Hybrid water splitting involves a thermochemical cycle in conjunc- tion with electrolysis. The main contenders in the hybrid splitting process are the hybrid sulfur cycle developed by Westinghouse and    the copper–chlorine cycle. Hybrid cycles have similar disadvantages and advantages as thermochemical cycles alone, mainly: slow response rates, large reactor sizes, utilize hazardous chemicals, and are less developed than purely electrolysis, but are more cost effective than electrolysis alone (Boardman, 2017).
5.3.1.Hybrid sulfur cycle (HyS) or westinghouse cycle
The hybrid sulfur cycle (HyS) has been the most promising hybrid cycle, having been down-selected as a candidate for future NHES use in the United States (Varrin et al., 2011). It was proposed by Westinghouse in 1975 as a hybrid version of the S–I cycle, and shares the H2SO4 decomposition step (El-Emam and Özcan, 2019; Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006). In addition, there is an electrolysis step which uses a polymer based membrane to produce hydrogen (Varrin et al., 2011). The process s shown in Fig. 11.
The chemical reactions that take place for H2SO4 decomposition and
SO2  electrolysis are shown in the following Varrin et al. (2011) and     Le Duigou et al. (2007):
@34
One potential advantage of the HyS cycle exists with the location of hydrogen production. The processes that require heat must be placed relatively close to the nuclear plant to minimize losses, which includes the decomposition step of this process. However, the electrolysis step, which actually produces the hydrogen, may be placed a safer distance away from the plant as it only requires electricity (Yildiz and Kazimi, 2006).
5.3.2. Copper–chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycle
The copper–chlorine cycle, like the Ca–Br cycle, has shown promise but is not as technologically mature as other processes (Varrin et al., 2011). However, it has a lower minimum temperature requirement, around 500 ◦C (Naterer et al., 2009),  than  the  other  thermochemi- cal processes which would allow it to couple with medium or high temperature as opposed to only high temperature reactors.
There are three Cu–Cl cycles proposed: a 3-step, 4-step, and 5-step cycle. The 4-step cycle was chosen for this study because it combines two steps of the 5-step cycle to reduce heat requirements and complex- ity, and has lower heat requirements than the 3-step process (Ozbilen et al., 2011). The chemical reactions that take place in the 4-step cycle are shown in the following reactions (Naterer et al., 2009), and a diagram of this process is shown in Fig. 12.

@35
The oxygen production step requires the highest temperatures. The electrolysis process shown only requires low (ambient) temperatures, but is combined with another (chemical) step that increases the mini- mum temperature to around 430 ◦C.
The Cu–Cl electrolysis step has been experimentally demonstrated for long durations by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Ontario Institute of Technol- ogy (Naterer et al., 2017). The electrolyzer can be PEM but more research is needed to develop a membrane that limits Cu crossover     to the cathode (hydrogen producing side) (Naterer et al., 2017). One challenge with the Cu–Cl process is related to materials due to lim- ited knowledge of corrosion resistance in materials by molten Cu–Cl (Naterer et al., 2017).
6.Results and discussion
NHES hydrogen candidates were compared based on their energy input and hydrogen production rates for low, medium, and high tem- perature reactors. They were also compared relative to their technology readiness level (TRL) and cost per kg of H2 production.
6.1.Process flow diagrams
Process flow energy and material input and output diagrams were created for the three reactor categories. These models assume the entire reactor thermal output (as shown in Table 2) is converted to a either electricity, heat, or both. The power cycle conversion rate is assumed to be 40%. As the reactor temperature category increases, there are more possible hydrogen production methods.
6.1.1.Low  temperature reactors
Low temperature reactors cover the category of LWRs, which may output water at temperatures around 300 ◦C. The only nuclear hybrid candidates that operate below this temperature are alkaline and PEM electrolysis. The average LWR power output is assumed to be 2500 MWt, and all power is assumed to be used for hydrogen production. Therefore, the following energy and material process flow diagrams, Fig. 13, shows electricity and heat (which total to 2500 MWt), and water consumption to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Given the as- sumptions made for modeling alkaline and PEM electrolysis, both produce reasonably similar amounts of hydrogen for a given thermal power input.

6.1.2.Medium temperature reactors
Medium temperature reactors encompass AGRs, SFRs, SCWRs, LFRs, and MSFRs, to name a few, with an output temperature less than 700– 750 ◦C. The nominal size was calculated to be 1800 MWt (Goldberg and Rosner, 2011). All processes that can couple with low temper- ature reactors (alkaline and PEM electrolysis) can also couple with medium temperature reactors but are less ideal due to wasted heat. Additionally, SOEC electrolysis and Cu–Cl cycle can operate at these reactor temperatures. An energy and material process flow diagram was also created for nuclear-assisted SMR, which requires 700–1000 ◦C steam and the additional input of natural gas (which is combusted to give the heat requirement). Fig. 14 shows these process flow diagrams. Note that since SMR only requires a small amount of electricity, an extremely large amount of hydrogen could be produced with the 720 MWe provided by a nuclear reactor. In reality, the amount of natural gas used for this much electricity would probably be a limiting factor. Excluding SMR, SOEC and the Cu–Cl cycles can produce much more hydrogen than either low temperature electrolysis method.
6.1.3.High temperature reactors
High temperature Generation IV reactors, such as the VHTR, MSR, or GFR, will likely be able  to  provide  outlet  temperatures  higher  than 900 ◦C, and possibly up to 950 ◦C. The average power output       of the three previously listed reactors hovers around 1400 MWt. All candidates could work with these reactors, but again the ones that require higher operating temperatures will be more efficient since less heat needs to be wasted in the process. However, as shown in Fig. 15, the Cu–Cl process would produce the most hydrogen, but would waste heat to lower the temperature. The SMR would still be limited by natural gas, not electricity.
6.2.Technology readiness level
The technology readiness level (TRL) is a means to describe the ex- tent of development necessary to reach the state of commercialization. It can range from theoretical principle, at TRL 1, to operational plant, at TRL 9. Fig. 16 shows the correspondence of TRL number to technology status (Boardman, 2017).
The TRL was estimated for all hydrogen production candidates (Boardman, 2017; El-Emam and Özcan, 2019; Ping et al., 2018; Varrin et al., 2011; Naterer et al., 2017). The minimum TRL of any component of the technology was  taken,  as  the  limiting  factor  in  development is the component with the lowest TRL. Fig. 17 shows the TRL levels    for all previously described candidates. SMR and alkaline electrolysis are the only current commercially available technologies. Electrolysis processes are also more developed than any thermochemical or hybrid process.
6.3.Cost comparison
Table 4 includes a range of  cost  per  unit  kg  of  hydrogen  for  each method. Thermal-based water splitting methods are expected to be more cost effective because the cost of electricity is significantly higher than the cost of heat (due to conversion) (El-Emam and Özcan, 2019). Similarly, production costs for electrolysis, requiring significant electricity, is highly dependent on electricity prices.
As seen in the process flow diagrams, SMR technology incurs ex- tremely high costs due to orders of magnitude more hydrogen pro- duced. In reality, SMR is the cheapest technology currently in a $/kg scenario (Table 2). Otherwise SOEC and S–I would likely be the cheap- est when coupled with a high temperature reactor, as these technolo- gies have previously been chosen for further development (Varrin et al., 2011). There are situations where hybrid systems may be profitable —
when hydrogen, electricity, and natural gas prices are high, or severe CO2 costs are included (Ruth et al., 2017). However, with the volatility of prices, flexible hybrid configurations are not currently valuable enough to overcome capital costs (Ruth et al., 2017). Further policy will likely need to be implemented (aiming at cleaner energy production)  to make hybrid systems profitable (Ruth et al., 2017). The Department of  Energy  (DOE),  as  of  late  2019,  has  issued  contracts  with  three Fig. 15.

7.Conclusion
With increasing renewable energy sources along with increasing pressure to promote clean, sustainable energy, nuclear hybrid energy systems are a potential way to keep nuclear competitive. With renew- able energy, grid power becomes increasingly volatile, leading to less base-load power systems, like nuclear, to flexible energy producers. These flexible energy producers are typically greenhouse gas emitting coal or natural gas plants. With nuclear hydrogen hybrid technology, an alternative commodity, hydrogen, could be produced to allow for grid load-following. This hydrogen can be used for  energy  storage  and convert back to energy during high electricity prices, or has the potential to be an energy carrier, to be used as fuel for transportation. Hydrogen does not produce CO2, rendering it a much cleaner fuel than currently used petroleum or natural gas.
Several hydrogen producing nuclear hybrid technologies were in- vestigated in this study. The NHES candidate technologies (along with the comparison SMR), including temperature, pressure, TRL, efficiency, hydrogen cost, and inputs and outputs are summarized in Table 4. These technologies only require water, heat and/or electricity, all of which are abundant around a nuclear plant, to produce hydrogen. Al- kaline water electrolysis is currently the only widespread, commercially available, large scale clean hydrogen production technology, but other technologies have shown rapid development and promise, along with potentially lower production costs.
Additionally, these hydrogen production technologies operate at various temperatures, which allows them to match closely with the current (Generation III) and future (Generation IV) reactor fleet. These
nuclear reactors may be loosely subdivided into three categories: low output temperatures (<300 ◦C), medium (<750 ◦C), and high tem- peratures (<950 ◦C). Within these categories, only low temperature electrolysis is currently available for low temperature reactors, but thermochemical and electrolysis methods could potentially be coupled with high temperature systems. Energy and material process flow di- agrams  were  created  for  hybrid  technologies  at  all  reactor category
levels. When coupled with around 2000 MWt power from a nuclear reactor, these technologies can generate between 200–500 tons/day of hydrogen, with no CO2 emissions. Current hybrid technologies are not cost effective, and will require either increased electricity prices, CO2 subsidies, or increased hydrogen prices to overcome capital costs. How- ever, new contracts from DOE will provide funding to nuclear power plants to demonstrate hydrogen production capabilities to improve the competitiveness of hybrid technology and improve plant economics.
