Radioactive wastes are formed during the production of uranium-plutonium nuclear fuel at enterprises. In the present article the concentration ranges for uranium, plutonium, and neptunium in liquid and cemented wastes corresponding to different radioactivity classes are determined. The concentration ranges are determined for wastes formed in the production of nitride fuel for the initial load, as well as for waste formed on use of recycled uranium, plutonium, and neptunium in production. The effect of 241Am accumulation on the classifi cation of radwaste is determined. The estimated cost of transferring the wastes formed on fabrication of mixed nitride fuel to the national operator for disposal is presented. The technological methods of reducing the cost of waste disposal, including the possibility of forming class-3 wastes for which surface disposal is admissible, are presented. The maximum concentration of plutonium and americium in liquid wastes at which the solidifi ed forms of wastes correspond to class 3 is determined.
Radioactive wastes are formed in the production of mixed uranium plutonium nuclear fuel at enterprises. Their isotopic composition is close to that of the produced fuel, but on fabrication of mixed oxide or nitride fuel the waste can contain 241Am, which is formed as a result of β-decay of relatively short-lived 241Pu.
In the present article we determine the class of the formed radwaste and estimate the cost of transferring the wastes to the national operator for disposal (neglecting the cost of on-site storage), since the indicated characteristic is signifi cant for the economics of production.
Criteria for classing liquid waste containing uranium and plutonium as radwaste. In accordance with the regulatory normative documentation [1, 2], solid and liquid wastes are classed as radioactive if the sum of the ratios of the specifi c activity of the radionuclides in the waste to their minimum value exceeds 1 (Table 1). We shall determine the uranium and plutonium content at which liquid wastes can be classifi ed as radwastes.
Criteria for classing as radioactive waste uranium and plutonium from the production of nitride fuel for the initial load. Recycled uranium, plutonium, and neptunium are not used in the production fuel for the initial load (Table 2).
The uranium component of the fuel consists of depleted uranium. The plutonium isotopes of the plutonium component can be divided into two groups: relatively long-lived α-emitting isotopes of plutonium (238Pu, 239Pu, 240Pu, 242Pu), which we shall denote as αPu, and the relatively short-lived β-emitting isotope 241Pu, which we shall denote as βPu.
The formula for determining the maximum concentration of an element in a liquid or solid medium above which the medium is classifi ed as radwaste has the form @ (1)where Ω is the maximum concentration of the element, measured in grams per kilogram of the enclosing medium, abovewhich waste containing the indicated element is classifi ed as radioactive; the index i denotes the isotope of the chosen element; N is the number of isotopes of the element; Ai is the specifi c activity of the isotope, Bq/g of the element; Bi  is the maximum admissible specifi c activity of the isotope, Bq/kg of the enclosing medium (solid or liquid).
TABLE 1. Maximum Specifi c Activity of Radionuclides in Materials above Which Wastes Are Classed as Radioactive [1] TABLE 2. Approximate Isotopic Composition of Uranium and Plutonium in the Nitride Fuel of the Initial Load [3] Analyzing Table 2 and using Eq. (1) it can be concluded that the liquid waste formed in the production of nitride fuel for the initial load should be classifi ed as radioactive for uranium content above 18 mg/kg, which is equivalent to 295 Bq/kg of the solution, or plutonium above 0.0043 μg/kg, which is equivalent to 552 Bq/kg of the solution, of which 505 Bq/kg (91.5%) is due to the β-activity of the short-lived isotope 241Pu.
For solid products classifi ed as solid radwaste, the uranium or plutonium concentration must exceed 0.61 g/kg or is 0.08 μg/kg of the solid matrix, respectively. This concentration of uranium and plutonium corresponds to specifi c activity of the matrix 104 Bq/g each. The solid products containing uranium and plutonium with the isotopic composition presented in Table 2 are not radwastes if the sum of their activity does not exceed 104 Bq/kg.

Criteria for classifying as radwaste the recycled uranium, plutonium, and neptunium used in the fabrication of nitride fuel. Nitride fuel can be fabricated using the recycled uranium, plutonium, and neptunium formed during the reprocessing of spent nitride fuel. In this case, aside from uranium and plutonium, whose isotopic composition will differ from that presented in Table 2, the fuel will contain 237Np. Let us analyze the computed isotopic composition of nitride fuel corresponding to the 10th sequential reactor load of fuel fabricated from recycled products of the spent fuel from the preceding load.
It follows from Table 3 that liquid wastes containing recycled uranium, plutonium, or neptunium must be classifi eas radioactive when their uranium content exceeds 2.4 mg/kg (1.3 kBq/kg of the solution), plutonium above 0.0058 μg/kg (740 Bq/kg of the solution), and neptunium above 5 μg/kg (130 Bq/kg of the solution). The solid products are classifi ed as solid radwaste if the uranium concentration exceeds 84 mg per 1 kg of the solid matrix (44 kBq/kg), or the concentration of plutonium exceeds 0.08 μg/kg (10 kBq/kg), or the concentration of neptunium exceeds 38 mg/kg of the solid matrix (1 kBq/kg).
Classifi cation of the fi nal forms of radwaste formed on production of nitride fuel. The isotopic composition of liquid radwaste formed during the production of nitride fuel and the composition of their fi nal forms – solid radwaste formed as a result of solidifi cation – is represented by α- and β-emitters (uranium isotopes) and transuranium elements (isotopes of plutonium and neptunium). The classifi cation of such waste is presented in the normative documentation [1] (section“Classifi cation of removed radwaste”).
Using the presented classifi cation (Table 4) and Eq. (1), where Bi  denotes the maximum specifi c activity of an isotope for the chosen class of solid waste, the concentration range of uranium, plutonium, and neptunium in the solidifi ed liquid radwaste that corresponds to different classes of waste can be determined (Table 5). Since the liquid wastes are to be solidifi ed by means of cementation, in which approximately 2.3 kg of the cement matrix forms from 1 L of the liquid solution, the concentration ranges of uranium, plutonium, and neptunium in the initial liquid waste that will correspond to defi nite classes of the fi nal forms of the radwaste can be determined. Analysis of Table 5 shows that in the classifi cation of the formed radioactive waste the use of recycled nuclear materials results in signifi cantly stricter limitations on the uranium concentration, primarily as a result of the production of 234U during subsequent recycling, and less strict limitations on the concentration of plutonium, wh h is associated with a reduction of the 238Pu fraction on recycling.
We shall now determine, using the following relations, the class of solid radwaste formed on solidifi cation of contaminated solutions containing simultaneously uranium, plutonium, and neptunium with concentration X, Y, Z (g/L): – for liquid wastes with isotopic composition corresponding to the initial load of mixed nitride fuel (without recycling of the nuclear materials):

Here and in Table 5 the possible ingress of americium, as a product of plutonium decay, into the wastes is neglected.
Effect of 241Am accumulation on the classifi cation of radwaste formed on fabrication of nitride fuel. The decay of the β-emitter 241Pu is accompanied by the accumulation of radioactive 241Am in the wastes. We shall determine the infl uence of the accumulated americium on the classifi cation of the formed radwastes.
Liquid media containing the isotope 241Am are classifi ed as radioactive when its concentration exceeds 0.54·10–9
g/kg of solution (or 69 Bq/kg of solution). For solid media, the maximum 241Am concentration is equal to 0.79·10–8 g/kg
(or 1000 Bq/kg). It is of practical interest to determine the effect of the accumulation of 241Am owing to the decay of 241Pu
on the classifi cation of solidifi ed radwastes.
Plutonium and americium are removed from solutions with different degrees of effi ciency, so that the ratio of their concentrations in the liquid wastes sent to solidifi cation can vary over wide limits. In this connection, it is expedient to possess data on the classifi cation of radwaste containing uranium, plutonium, and neptunium with isotopic composition of the fabricated fuel, as well as 241Am (Table 6).
The admissible content of 241Am in liquid wastes for obtaining the fi nal form of the solid waste of the corresponding class (by cementation) can be determined using the conversion factor 2.3 kg/L. If isotopes of uranium, plutonium, and neptunium as well as 241Am are present simultaneously in the liquid wastes, the class of the fi nal forms of the wastes formed on solidifi cation of liquid waste can be determined by using together with the data in Table 6 the relations for waste containing uranium, plutonium, and neptunium. The relations can be simplifi ed by eliminating uranium from the analysis, since the means of purifi cation make it possible to separate it from solutions to milligram residual concentration per liter of solution.
Thus, the effect of uranium on the classifi cation of the fi nal forms of solid radwaste is very small. Moreover, since on classifi cation of waste the presence of recycled nuclear materials results in very small changes in the maximum content of plutonium, a conservative estimate can be used – an estimate based on the isotopic composition of plutonium corresponding to the initial fuel load. The relations for determining the waste class on the basis of the concentration of plutonium, neptunium, and americium are as follows:
(A/1.8·10–3) + (Y/1.8·10–3) + (Z/8.8) > 1 – 1st class;
(A/1.8·10–3) + (Y/1.8·10–3) + (Z/8.8) < 1;
(A/1.8·10–6) + (Y/2.1·10–5) + (Z/8.8·10–3) > 1 – 2nd class;
(A/1.8·10–6) + (Y/2.1·10–5) + (Z/8.8·10–3) < 1;
(A/1.8·10–7) + (Y/1·10–6) + (Z/8.8·10–4) > 1 – 3rd class;
(A/1.8·10–7) + (Y/1·10–6) + (Z/8.8·10–4) < 1;
(A/1.8·10–8) + (Y/1·10–8) + (Z/1.2·10–5) > 1 – 4th class;
(A/1.8·10–8) + (Y/1·10–8) + (Z/1.2·10–5) < 1 – industrial wastes,
where A is the americium concentration, g/L.
Analysis. The design documentation for the production of mixed nitride nuclear fuel within the framework of Project Breakthrough contains limits on the activity of the liquid waste going into the cementation operation, 6·107 Bq/kg, limiting the production of the fi nal forms of waste in the medium-activity category. For such activity, the plutonium concentration in the liquid waste will be equal to 0.5–0.7 mg/L depending on its salt content. Correspondingly in solid waste solidifi ed by the cementation method the plutonium concentration will be equal to 0.22–0.3 mg/kg, which corresponds to class-2 wastes (see Table 5).
We shall now determine the cost of disposal of waste containing plutonium. For the disposal of 1 g, in accordance with the presented maximum admissible concentration of plutonium, about 4 t (or about 2 m3) of the cement matrix will be required. Considering the tariff for the disposal of radwaste [4] (in 2017 prices 594,000 rubles per 1 m3 of class-2 waste),the disposal of 1 g of plutonium will cost 1.2·106  rubles, neglecting the volume and the cost of packaging the waste. For the admissible actinide losses 0.1%, as adopted in Project Breakthrough, in the waste and the nominal productivity on fabrication of nitride fuel 5 t/yr, the losses of plutonium in the wastes could reach 750 g/yr. The cost of disposal of wastes with this quantity of plutonium, which are processed by the cementation method, will be equal to 0.9·109 rubles per year. In addition, the 1500 m3 of radioactive waste formed per year are to be buried deep underground.
To reduce the indicated costs, other methods must be used to reprocess waste or to decrease the loss of plutonium present in the wastes. For example, on vitrifi cation of radwastes up to 0.6 wt.% of actinides is allowed in borosilicate glass, although at the same time there is a limit on the amount of α-decay per unit volume of the glassy matrix as well as on the release of energy per unit mass of the matrix [5]. Nevertheless, even if plutonium is included at the level 0.1 g per 1 kg of the borosilicate  glass 7.5 t borosilicate glass will be needed for the disposal of the formed waste, or 2.8 m3 of glass per year the cost of its disposal will be equal to 3.6·106 rubles per year (the cost of disposal of class-1 waste is 1.3·106 ubles per 1 m3  in 2017 prices [4]). It is necessary to take into account the fact that the inclusion of plutonium in glass at the level 0.1 g per 1 kg of glass requires the development of an infrastructure for managing high-level wastes, including a facility for vitrifi cation of hi h-level waste.
Of special interest from the standpoint of reducing the costs of disposal of the formed wastes is the possibility of forming class-3 wastes, whose cost of disposal is equal to 140,000 rubles per 1 m3 and for which near-surface disposal is admissible [4]. To obtain class-3 wastes it is necessary to meet the conditions on the concentration of transuranium elements and solidifi ed liquid wastes, which can be expressed by the relation A/1.8·10–6 + Y/2.1·10–5 + Z/8.8·10–3 < 1.
Signifi cant cost reduction is possible only on purifi cation of liquid waste of actinides to the concentration determined by the indicated relation with the separated plutonium returned into the technological cycle and with limits on its ingress into the wastes.
It is well to bear in mind that the latter relation, just as the relations for determining the waste class, was obtained on the basis of an analysis of the isotopic composition of the plutonium used for fabrication of mixed nitride fuel. It can be supposed that for a signifi cant time interval between fabrication of the fuel and transfer of the waste to disposal a defi nite part of the short-lived 241Pu is transmuted into 241Am. This should be taken into account, tightening the requirements of the maximum plutonium content, since the classifi cation of wastes is determined for the time when they are to be transferred to the national operator for disposal. We present the following estimates.
Replacing in Table 2 the isotope 241Pu by 241Am we obtain: the total activity in terms αPu and 241Am formed from all βPu will be equal to 1.5·1010 Bq/g. Taking this into account, we obtain a more stringent limit for classifying solidifi ed wastes as class-3, taking into account the transformation of some 241Pu into 241Am: A/1.8·10–6 + Y/1.5·10–5 + Z/8.8·10–3 < 1.
In summary, in order to class solidifi ed wastes as class-3, which permits near-surface disposal, the plutonium concentration in the initial liquid wastes must not exceed 15 μg/L and 241Am must not exceed 1.8 μg/L. To secure the indicated concentration, the liquid waste must be purifi ed of transuranium elements, including alkaline precipitation and ultrafi ltration purifi cation of the mother solutions. To return of 99.9% of the plutonium into the technological cycle, the cost of disposal of the unextracted plutonium in class-3 cemented wastes will be equal to about 8·106 rubles per year (58 m3of waste per year).
Conclusion. Analysis shows that the solidifi cation of liquid wastes by means of cementation without additional extraction of plutonium and its return into the technological cycle results in high cost of the subsequent disposal of the waste.
The cost of disposal can be reduced by using the technology of vitrifi cation of liquid wastes. In addition, proper operating conditions with high-level waste must be provided at enterprises and a setup must be developed for the vitrifi cation of highlevel waste. Another possibility of reducing costs is purifi cation of the formed liquid waste of transuranium elements, which reduces the amount of actinides transferred into waste and permits the formation of class-3 wastes admitting near-surface disposal. In addition, in order to obtain class-3 wastes the plutonium concentration in the liquid waste must not exceed 15 μg/L and the americium concentration must not exceed 1.8 μg/L. Estimates for the plutonium concentration were made for the isotopic composition of plutonium used in the production of mixed nitride fuel for the BREST-OD-300 reactor, including taking into account the possibility of recycling of the plutonium.
