ABSTRACT
A comprehensive study of photon interaction features has been made for some alloys containing Pd and Ag content to evaluate its possible use as alternative gamma radiations shielding material. The mass
attenuation coefﬁcient (m/r) of the present alloys was measured at various photon energies between
81 keVe1333 keV utilizing HPGe detector. The measured m/r values were compared to those of theo- retical and computational (MCNPX code) results. The results exhibited that the m/r values of the studied alloys are in the same line with results of WinXCOM software and MCNPX code results at all energies.
Moreover, Pd75/Ag25 alloy sample has the maximum radiation protection efﬁciency (about 53% at
81 keV) and lowest half value layer, which shows that Pd75/Ag25 has superior gamma radiation shielding performance among the other compared alloys.Keywords:

Shielding against high-energetic gamma photons is absolutely mandatory at reactor or nuclear research center in order to reduce the dose level up to allowable limits [1]. The type and thickness of the required shielding material are related to the types of radiation, ac- tivity of the radio-isotope, cost effectiveness and exposure rate. A forceful shield material leads to both a signiﬁcant energy loss at a small penetration distance and reduces as much as possible the possibility of further emission of dangerous radiations [2]. Since traditional radia- tion shielding materials namely lead (Pb) and concretes have few disadvantages such as toxicity, strength, etc., many researchers re- ported some novel and alternative shielding materials such as glass,
alloy and polymer to prevent from gamma radiation [3e8].
Among alternative materials, alloys have been paid attention to widely used in different ﬁelds such as transportations, aerospace, modern technologies, biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. Their main basic features are to provide better qualities than theparent elements by composing of two or more elements with different structures that can improve advanced properties namely hardness, corrosion resistance and tensile strength [9]. In recent years, there are a great number of theoretical and computational (based on different simulation codes) investigations on photon shielding efﬁciency of various alloy materials [3,10e14]. Singh and Badiger reported the gamma photons attenuation parameters of nine alloys  such  as  cupero-nickel,  monel-400,  carbon-steel  (CS)-516,
stainless steel (SS)-403 and incoloy-600 [15] and found the cupero- nickel has superior gamma photon shielding in comparison with the other alloys. Chen et al. [16] surveyed both the shielding and mechanical   performances   for    the    MgeZnexCueZr    alloys   (x 0e2.32 wt%). They observed that shielding effectiveness was enhanced meaningfully with increment of Cu content and the sample containing 2.32 wt% Cu represented the optimal EMI shielding ca- pacity. Recently, the gamma ray shielding parameters have been determined for the Al-based glassy alloys by Manjunatha et al. [17] and Al60Y33Ni5Co1Fe0.5Pd0.5 was found to be a suitable shielding material for the gamma rays. Besides, Akman et al. [9] made com- parison study of the photon shielding features of various alloy  ma-
terials, which is composed of Ag, Cu, Pd and Cr elements, by experimental,  WinXCom  and  MCNPX  code  for  several  energies
between of 81e1333 keV and found that the Ag92.5/Cu7.5 sample is the most effective shield material among the selected alloys.
On the other hand, silver-palladium alloys are of scientiﬁc in- terest and nowadays they are used in several applications such as electrical contact materials, in medical and dental ﬁelds [18]. The main aim of this study is to determine the gamma photon atten- uation parameters of various alloys by doped in different rates of Pd and Ag for radiation detection applications. It has been measured the experimental mass attenuation coefﬁcients at photon energies between 80.997  and 1332.501  keV  using the  transmission   geome-
try technique. The mass attenuation coefﬁcient (m/r) values of the
investigated alloys have been computed theoretically (WinXCom software) and also simulated by MCNPX code to test the conﬁr- mation of the experimental results.
2.Material and method
2.1.Theoretical basis
The linear attenuation coefﬁcient of the samples under inves- tigation is deﬁned from the well-known exponential attenuation rule:@1
in the previous equation I and I0 denote respectively the trans-
mitted and initial intensities.
Since the alloy sample contains more than one element, the m/r can be evaluated from the mixture rule namely [19]:@2
where wi is the weight fraction of the ith element in the material. It is expressed in cm2/g. The mm value of alloys can be calculated for a speciﬁc energy range using WinXCom software based on the mixture rule [20].
The molecular cross section can be computed utilizing the above
m /r quantity as below [21]:@3
where NA is the Avogadro number, ni and Ai represent the number of element and the atomic weight of the ith element in the material, respectively. The total atomic cross section (sa) can be determined
as follow [22,23]:@4
Additionally, the total electronic cross-section (se) can be expressed mathematically as [24]:
@5
The above three quantities presented in equations (3)e(5) helped us to determine the effective atomic number (Zeff) for the investi- gated sample according to equation (6) [22]:
@6
The radiation protection efﬁciency (RPE) also another parameter gives an indication about the effectiveness of any absorber to shield the photons and determined from both the original photon beam which emitted from the radioactive point source and the attenu- ated beam (owing to the presence of any absorber located between the source and the detector) counted on the detector. The RPE values for the samples under investigation are estimated by the following equation [25,26]:27
The half value layer (HVL) is the thickness at which the intensity of the attenuated photon is 50% the intensity of the original photon and depends inversely on the m namely [27]:@8
2.2.Experimental details
The selected alloy samples in this investigation contain two el- ements namely palladium (Pd, Z 46) and silver (Ag, Z  47). The  four selected alloy samples containing different fractions of 77, 75,30 and 70% for Pd and 23, 25, 70 and 30 for Ag, which is tagged as
Pd77/Ag23, Pd75/Ag25, Pd30/Ag70 and Pd70/Ag30, respectively. In addition, the densities of alloys are 11.16, 11.7, 10.9 and 11.6 g/cm3 for Pd77/Ag23, Pd75/Ag25, Pd30/Ag70 and Pd70/Ag30, respectively.
Gamma ray spectrometer equipped with High purity germanium  (HPGe) detector was employed to count the high-energy photons intensities of 81, 122, 136, 161, 276, 303, 356, 384, 511, 662, 835, 1173, 1275 and 1333 keV by using various radioactive point sources. The HPGe detector has an active crystal length and diameter of 25 and 70 mm, respectively, and a resolutions of 0.380 keV at 5.9 keV,0.585 keV at 122 keV and 1.8 keV at 1330 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) and is kept at  liquid  nitrogen temperature  ( 196 ○C) during the experiments. The energy calibration for spec- trometer was applied with help of a mixed calibration source including 22Na, 54Mn, 57,60Co, 137Cs, 133Ba, 203Hg and 241Am. The schematic arrangement of the experimental system used is exhibi- ted in Fig. 1 [28]. Each alloy material was located between the de-
tector and the radioactive point source. After spectrum acquisitions,
software (demo) with least-squares ﬁt method. Additionally, the experimental uncertainty of attenuation coefﬁcient measurements was determined by the relation [31e33]:@9
where Drx denotes the uncertainty in the mass per unit area, DI and DI0 are the uncertainties of I and I0 intensities, respectively.

2.3.MCNPX code
In order to assess the validity of the measured results, Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code System-extended (MCNPX) has been applied. Fig. 2 represents the MCNPX 3-D appearance of gamma photon attenuation layout with various simulation mate- rials including a point radioactive source, the alloy as shielding material, Pb blocks to avoid the scattered photons, lead (Pb) colli- mator for primary radiation beam and F4 tally mesh detection ﬁeld. The studied alloys have been located between the F4 tally mesh and the source at a distance of 50 cm. More details on simulation setup can be taken from our previous studies [34,35].
3.Results and discussion
The experimental m/r results and their uncertainties calculated by detecting the intensity of photons that passes through the alloys have been demonstrated in Table 1. It can be easily seen from this
table that these results of four alloy samples are decreased with increment of photon energy. Additionally, the uncertainties of m/r values are in the range of 1.01%e4.61% for Pd77/Ag23 sample, 1.01e3.46% for Pd75/Ag25 sample, 1.00e4.72% and 1.01e4.84% for Pd70/Ag30  sample.  The  estimated  uncertainty  values  can be
ascribed to the counting statistics in intensities of original (I0) and transmitted (I) photons, scattering effects and measurement of sample  mass  per  unit  area.  These  low  uncertainties  of  m/r
demonstrate how the m/r as well as other shielding parameters for
the investigated alloy samples are measured with the high accuracy.
Moreover, the m/r of the selected alloys has been calculated
through both theoretical and computational techniques to validate the experimental data. Thence, the experimental m/r results have been compared to values obtained by utilizing WinXCom  software
and MCNPX simulation code and represented graphically in Fig. 3. It is evident in Fig. 3 that the measured, WinXCom and MCNPX m/r values of different alloys agreed quite well with each other. The
percentage relative deviations (RD) among the experimental, WinXCom and MCNPX results of m/r were established with the help of the following relations [36,37]:@10
where m=ra and m=rb denote the theoretical and computational m/r values of the alloys.
The obtained RD values among results of different techniques were  given  in  Fig.  4  and  found  in  the  range  of  4.94e0.0%   and	5.50e1.19% for experimentaleWinXCom and experimentaleMCNPX results of alloys samples, respectively. These differences can be based on the mixture rule that ignores the in- teractions between atoms in mixtures or compounds. Therefore, it
can say that the measured m/r data are in an agreement with both the theoretical and computational results.
Moreover, the m/r value for the alloys reduces exponentially over the low energy region (up to about 400 keV) as the change in
m/r  values   is   getting   smaller   with    increasing   of    energy (E > 400 keV). The most important reason of this trend is due to
several photon interaction processes. Brieﬂy, the photoelectric ab- sorption (PE) is the most important photon-matter interaction mode for E < 400 keV, while for 400 keV < E < 1330 KeV Compton scattering (CS) processes is more dominant than PE. The PE and CS processes are depending upon the energy as E—3.5 and E—1 respectively. This demonstrates the quick reducing happens for the
m/r  for  energy  less  than  400  keV.  It  is  worth  mention  that all
samples have the highest attenuation value at the lowest energy (i.e. at 81 keV), this is owing to the dependence of PE on the atomic number as Z4—5. While with further increase in the energy, the m/r
for the four samples become very close to each other. This is maybe due to the dependence of CS on the atomic number, where this process is proportional to the atomic number as Z.
Additionally, the results revealed that the m/r  values have the
descending order of Ag70/Pd30 (2.4020 ± 0.0241 cm2/g) > Pd70/ Ag30 (2.3888 ± 0.0241 cm2/g)> Pd75/Ag25 (2.3569 ± 0.0237 cm2/g)
> Pd77/Ag23 (2.3342 ± 0.0235 cm2/g) at  81  keV  energy  (see  Table 1). It means that Ag70/Pd30 alloy sample has the maximum mass attenuation coefﬁcient among the investigated alloy samples. This is due to fact that Ag70/Pd30 has a content of higher atomic number (i.e Ag) with fraction of 70%.
Another parameter is the radiation protection efﬁciency (RPE) obtained from the intensities of original (I0) and transmitted (I) photon intensity as given in Equation (7). This parameter plays an important role in comparison of the performances of the selected samples to attenuate the incoming photons. Fig. 5 indicates the variation of the RPE for the studied alloy samples. From Fig. 5, all photon energy. Among alloys in this study, Pd75/Ag25 sample has the maximum RPE  (about 53% at 81  keV).  This result implies that

Pd75/Ag25 demonstrated the highest gamma photon attenuation properties especially for the photon with low energy when compared to the other alloys. It is worth mention that Pd75/Ag25 has the highest density among the selected alloys and therefore, we can conclude that the density of the sample plays a decisive role in determining the number of gamma photons being attenuated
when passing through the alloy sample. Pd75/Ag25 is denser than the rest of alloys (since the density of Pd and Ag is 12.023 g/cm3 and
10.49 g/cm3 respectively), thus more gamma photons being attenuated by this denser alloy sample, because the probability of the photons interaction with the atoms of the alloy sample is comparatively   high   due   to  tightly   packed   particle   inside the

sample. This reveals that high-density alloy sample is more efﬁcient than the lower density sample for attenuating the intensity of the incident gamma radiation.
The Zeff values of these alloys that are composed of two ele- ments with Z of 46 and 47, in different proportions have been calculated. Fig. 6 represents the obtained results at several energies from 81 keV to 1333 keV, which shows that the variation in Zeff remains more or less stationary for all alloys expect for ﬂuctuation at about 400 keV. It is found that the Zeff values are related to the relative proportion of Z of elements of which the sample is composed and therefore increase  with  an  increase  in  the Ag (Z 47) concentrations as indicated in Fig. 6. The ranges of Zeff are 46.228e46.242,           46.249e46.272,           46.299e46.315         and
46.697e46.719  for  Pd77/Ag23,  Pd75/Ag25,  Pd70/Ag30  and  Ag70/
Pd30, respectively. The slight increase in Zeff is attributed to the replacement of Pd content by Ag. El-Kateb et al. [38] reported similar results where Zeff is almost constant for several samples such as steel, bronze, lead-antimony and aluminum-silicon.
The HVL values of the alloy samples under study have been calculated using the obtained m values with help of Equation (8), and the values are plotted in Fig. 7(a). The range of HVL of the studied alloys is observed to be 0.03e1.21 cm, 0.03e1.23 cm, 0.023e1.30 cm and 0.025e1.31 cm for Pd70/Ag30, Pd75/Ag25,
Pd77/Ag23 and Ag70/Pd30, respectively. As seen in Fig. 7(a), the lowest and highest HVL values are found for Pd75/Ag25 and Ag70/ Pd30 alloy samples, respectively. The low HVL values of Pd75/Ag25
sample are based on the high density of this sample (r    11.7 g/
cm3). This conﬁrms that the gamma photon attenuation by the present alloys at different energies is extremely dependent on the density of the sample. The alloy of higher density provide a higher chances for the gamma photons to strike the atoms and this in- creases the probability of the photon interaction with these atoms and as a results a relatively few photons can transmitted from the alloy sample.
On other hand, it is highly required comparison of the photon shielding characteristic with previously reported various alloys to estimate the performance of the selected alloy samples and the probability of improvement as a alternative shielding material. The obtained HVL values of the investigated alloy samples are compared to those of Pd60/Cu40, Pd94/Cr6, Ag92.5/Cu7.5, and Ag72/Cu28 alloys published by Akman et al. [9]. While the HVL results of Ag70/Pd30 and Pd70/Ag30 samples are a rather similar as those of Ag92.5/Cu7.5, Pd60/Cu40 and Ag72/Cu28 alloys, the Pd75/ Ag25 and Pd94/Cr6 sample has lowest and highest HVL values than results of the alloys under investigation. It is deduced from Fig. 7(b)

that among the compared alloys, the Pd75/Ag25 sample will exhibit superior gamma ray shielding features in case of use as gamma radiation shielding material for any energy.
4.Conclusion
We reported m/r, RPE, Zeff and HVL for four alloy samples composed of different rates of Pd and Ag. The radiation shielding performances have been determined experimentally, theoretical (WinXCom software) and computational (MCNPX simulation code) at various energies from 81 to 1333 keV. The relative deviations between   both   experimental   data-WinXCom   and   experimental
data-MCNPX values are less  than  6%  which conﬁrmed that  the  m/r
values were obtained with high accuracy. The reported results indicated that among the selected alloys, Pd75/Ag25 alloy sample has superior photon shielding characteristics. Moreover, the ob- tained data from this work can pioneer in points of development of new materials used as shielding materials. The presented radiation attenuation values of the investigated are extremely important for many ﬁelds such as medical applications, shielding researchers and radiation physics.
