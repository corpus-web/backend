cyber security protection has gone through a rapid de￾velopment in today’s internet connected world. With the wide application of the booming technologies such as the Internet of ings (IoT) and the cloud computing, huge amount of data are generated and collected. While the data can be used to better serve the corresponding business needs, they also pose big challenges for the cyber security and privacy pro￾tection. It becomes very dicult if not impossible to discover the malicious behavior among the big data in real time. us,
this gives rise to the cyber security solutions which are driven
inference, big data analysis, deep learning, and so on. AI￾driven cyber security analytics has already found its appli￾cations in the next generation rewall which includes the
automatic intrusion detection system, encrypted trac
classication, malicious software detection, and so on. In the
area of cryptography, AI-driven solution starts to help the
researchers optimize the algorithm design and can largely
reduce the cryptanalysis eort such as searching the dier￾ential trails which is crucial in dierential cryptanalysis.
Recently, the idea of generative adversary network was ap￾plied to building the automatic encryption algorithm, which
makes a rst move towards making an intelligent protection
solution without the interference of the human eort. On the
contrary, individual’s privacy is under threat given the AI￾based systems. e rise of AI-enabled cyberattacks is expected
to cause an explosion of network penetrations, personal data
thefts, and an epidemic-level spread of intelligent computer
viruses. us, another future trend is to defend AI-driven
attacks by using AI-driven techniques, which will possibly
lead to an AI arms race. AI-driven security solution is one of
the fastest growing elds which bring together researchers
from multiple areas such as machine learning, statistics, big
data analytics, and cryptography to ght against the advanced
cyber security threats. e purpose of this special issue is to
present the cutting-edge research progress from both aca￾demia and industry, with a particular emphasis on the new
tools, techniques, concepts, and applications concerning the
AI-driven cyber security analytics and privacy protection. A
brief summary of all the accepted papers is provided as
follows.
In the paper by Y. Zhao et al., a novel feature extraction
method of hybrid gram (H-gram) with cross entropy of
continuous overlapping subsequences was proposed based
on the dynamic feature analysis of malware, which imple￾mented semantic segmentation of a sequence of API calls or
instructions. e experimental results showed that the
H-gram method can distinguish the malicious behaviors and
is more eective than the xed-length n-gram in all four
performance indexes of the classication algorithms such as
ID3, Random Forest, AdboostM1, and Bagging.
e paper by T. Hu et al. proposed a user authentication
method based on mouse biobehavioral characteristics and
deep learning, which can accurately and eciently perform
continuous identity authentication on current computer
users to address insider threats. An open source dataset with
ten users was applied to carry out experiments, and the
experimental results demonstrated the eectiveness of the
approach. e proposed approach can complete a user
authentication task approximately every 7 seconds, with a
false acceptance rate of 2.94% and a false rejection rate of
2.28%.
In the paper by G. Huang et al., the algorithm MFS_AN
(mining fault severity of all nodes) was proposed to mine the

key nodes from the software network. A weighted software
network model was built by using functions as nodes, with
relationships as edges, and times as weight. By exploiting the
recursive method, a fault probability metric FP of a function
is defined according to the fault accumulation characteristic,
and a fault propagation capability metric FPC of a function is
proposed according to the fault propagation characteristic.
Based on the FP and FPC, the fault severity metric FS was put
forward to obtain the function nodes with larger fault severity in the software network. Experimental results on two
real software networks showed that the algorithm MFS_AN
can discover the key function nodes correctly and effectively.
#e paper by H. Park proposed the Secure Information
Sharing System (SISS) model with the main method as a
group key cryptosystem. SISS figured out important problems of group key systems. (1) #e newly developed equations for encryption and decryption can eliminate the rekeying and redistribution process for every membership
change of the group, keeping the security requirements. (2)
#e new 3D stereoscopic image mobile security technology
with AR (Augmented Reality) solved the problem of conspiracy by group members. (3) SISS used the reversed oneway hash chain to guarantee Forward Secrecy and Backward
Accessibility (security requirements for information sharing
in a group). It showed that the security analysis of SISS
according to the Group Information-sharing Secrecy and
experiment on the performance of SISS. As a result, SISS
made it possible to securely share sensitive information from
collaborative works.
paper by Y. Zhao et al. addressed the problem of CCA secure public key encryption against after-the-fact leakage without NIZK proofs. To obtain security against chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) for PKE schemes against after-the-fact leakage attack (AFL), previous works followed the paradigm of “double encryption” which needs noninteractive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs in the encryption algorithm. #is paper presented an alternative way to achieve AFL-CCA security via lossy trapdoor functions (LTFs) without NIZK proofs. Formalization of definition of LTFs secure against AFL (AFLR-LTFs) and all-but-one variants (ABO) was given. #en, it showed how to realize this primitive in the split-state model. #is primitive can be used to construct an AFLR-CCA-secure PKE scheme in the same way as the method of “CCA from LTFs” in traditional sense.
In the paper by J. Ren et al., a software buffer overflow vulnerability prediction method by using software metrics and a decision tree algorithm was proposed. First, the software metrics were extracted from the software source code, and data from the dynamic data stream at the functional level were extracted by a data mining method. Second, a model based on a decision tree algorithm was constructed to measure multiple types of buffer overflow vulnerabilities at the functional level. Finally, the experimental results showed that the method ran in less time than SVM, Bayes, adaboost, and random forest algorithms and achieved 82.53% and 87.51% accuracy in two different data sets. In the paper by S. Zhao et al., a three-layer classifier using machine learning to identify mobile traffic in open-world settings was proposed. #e proposed method had the capability of identifying the traffic generated by unconcerned apps and zero-day apps; thus, it can be applied in the real world. A self-collected dataset that contains 160 apps was used to validate the proposed method. #e experimental results showed that the classifier achieved over 98% precision and produced a much smaller number of false positives than that of the state-of-the-art.
