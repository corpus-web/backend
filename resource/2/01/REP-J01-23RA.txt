ABSTRACT
Various composite shielding materials have favorable structural, mechanical, physical, and nuclear properties, besides their economic affordability. Such properties have widened the usage of composites around the globe in large-scale installations such as nuclear medical facilities, nuclear power plants, and spent nuclear fuel storage. In the current study, two groups of polymer composites have been prepared and their gamma-ray attenuation characteristics have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Four samples of each group have been prepared by varying the doped material (BaTiO3 and CaWO4) percentage between 5% and 20% with in- crements of 5%. To investigate the gamma-ray attenuation features, the linear attenuation coefficient, radiation protection efficiency, half value layer, mean free path, and effective atomic number parameters for these polymer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 were obtained in the energy range between 59.5 and 1408.0 keV (at 22 different energies) using narrow beam transmission geometry. The experiments were performed with the aid of an HPGe detector and eight different radioisotope point sources. According to the experimental and theoretical results, BaTiO3 (20%) and CaWO4 (20%) have better gamma-ray attenuation properties than the other prepared polymer composites. Moreover, CaWO4 (20%) has better gamma-ray attenuation features than BaTiO3 (20%).

1.Introduction
Over the last few decades, there has been a rapid increase in the use of radioactive material in different fields including basic science, med- icine, and industry. Radioactive material also has valuable applications within large scale construction like particle accelerators, power plants, and irradiation facilities. All the above-mentioned nuclear techniques have brought tremendous benefits to humankind and have advanced the betterment of human lives in many ways. However, radioactive material emits high energy radiation which, when it interacts with living or non- living mediums, can cause heating, breaking of chemical bonds, or ionizing of molecules. The most serious effect takes place when the ra- diation is energetic enough to break the molecules’ bonds and release ionized species. The extent to which such ionizing radiation can cause
damage to the nearby environment is largely determined by the energy of the incident radiation and the material exposed to the radiation (Baltas et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2018; Obaid et al., 2018). Among the ionizing radiation types, gamma is the most penetrating type and can pass right through the human body, consequently creating ionizations and damaging the tissues. However, gamma can be stopped by a very dense medium like a thick shield of concrete or any lead-based material. Although the radiation from naturally occurring or man-made radioactive material is a powerful tool with great beneficial applica- bility in various areas, it nevertheless carries biological and environ- mental hazardous risks. Protecting the nearby exposed people, equipment, and environment is essential in order to reduce the risk of damage associated with radiation. For this reason, gamma attenuation behavior inside different forms of constructional material is a very active

topic in the field of nuclear engineering. In order to ensure that the design and construction of the shielding barrier are capable of stopping the radiation, the shielding material attenuation properties must be both well characterized and predictable.
Traditionally, concrete composites of ordinary and special blends have proven their effective shielding capabilities. Various composite shielding materials have favorable structural, mechanical, physical, and nuclear properties, besides its economical affordability. Such properties have widened the composites usage around the globe in large-scale in- stallations such as nuclear medical facilities, nuclear power plants, and spent nuclear fuel storage. The betterment of composites properties for specific applications can be tailored for a wide range of applicability by varying the composition and density of the composites. Introducing high-density material to radiation-shielding composites can improve its ability to reduce the radiation intensity to the lowest possible reasonable level. The higher density composites shielding provides economic and constructional advantages in terms of faster attenuation and shielding structure cost and space consideration.The increased use of different blends of composites as radiation shielding material led to the need for knowledge about the composites’ specific shielding properties. There- fore, extensive numbers of experimental and theoretical studies have been dedicated to investigating the shielding properties of different composites (Seenappa et al., 2018; Cataldo and Prata, 2019; Li et al., 2017a, 2017b; Bel et al., 2019; Muthamma et al., 2019; Tijani and Al-Hadeethi, 2019; Pavlenko et al., 2019; Alavian and Tavakoli-Anbaran, 2019). Furthermore, these studies reference shield- ing data for a huge variety of compositions which have been previously made (Akkurt et al., 2005; Akman et al., 2019a, 2019b).
In the current study, two groups of composites have been prepared and their properties have been tested experimentally and theoretically.
The first tested group is a composition of barium titanate and the second group is a composition of calcium tungstate. Barium titanate is a well- known ferroelectric inorganic compound with the chemical formula BaTiO3. Barium titanate possesses excellent electromechanical, dielec- tric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties (Jiang et al., 2019; Qing et al., 2018). On the other hand, calcium tungstate is an important ore mineral with the chemical formula CaWO4. Calcium tungstate is of in- terest for many applications due to its low cost and high stability as well as its luminescence and optical properties (Koukou et al., 2017; Kamenskikh et al., 2001). Furthermore, both barium titanate and cal- cium tungstate-based polymer composites are lead-free and hence cause fewer concerns are associated with their use in terms of toxicity, heaviness, and adherence to health standards.
In order to computationally investigate gamma attenuation in the radiation-shielding composites, WinXCOM, a windows version of the XCOM, has been used in the current study. WinXCOM was employed to assess the shielding properties of the polymer composites reinforced with barium titanate and calcium tungstate samples and to compute their attenuation coefficients. Data from WinXCOM have been compared with the experimental measurement of the samples’ shielding proper- ties. The reported attenuation properties for the materials under inves- tigation are highly valuable for determining the effect of doping composites with barium titanate or calcium tungstate on shielding capability enhancement.
The aim of this study is to investigate the gamma-ray attenuation characteristics of polymer composites reinforced with different ratios of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 compounds. Linear attenuation coefficient, radia- tion protection efficiency, half value layer, mean free path, and effective atomic number parameters were obtained experimentally and theoret- ically in the photon energy range for 59.5 keV–1408.0 keV to examine

the gamma-ray attenuation characteristics of the prepared composites.
2.Experimental details
In the preparation of polymer composites, unsaturated polyester resin (C16O7H14), MEKP (Methyl Ethyl Ketone Peroxide, C8O6H18), and Cobalt Octoate (CoC16H30O4) were utilized as binder, hardener, and accelerator respectively in order to obtain suitable mechanical and physical properties. The production of the polymer composites was carried out in two different stages. In the first stage, a polymer matrix was obtained by mixing unsaturated polyester resin, MEKP, and Cobalt Octoate in appropriate amounts. 0.5% MEKP and 5% Cobalt Octoate of unsaturated polyester resin were added into the polymer composites. In the second stage, polymer composites were prepared by adding 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% BaTiO3 or CaWO4 by weight of unsaturated

polyester resin into the polymer matrix. The powder form of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 were used. The obtained wet polymer composite was poured into the mold and the curing process was completed after approximately 30 min. The polymer composite sample extracted from the mold has 2 cm diameter and 1 cm thickness. The production stages of the polymer composites are shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 summarizes the chemical composition and mass density for the eight tested samples. In both groups, it can be noted that sample density increases as the weight percentage of the doped material increases.
In order to corroborate the computational investigations, gamma attenuation experiments have been conducted in the current study. To examine the gamma radiation attenuation characteristics of the pre- pared polymer composites, the narrow beam transmission geometry shown in Fig. 2 was utilized. In the experimental geometry, the distances between the sample and the detector, and the source and the sample

were set to 10 mm and 140 mm, respectively. The test system consists of a high resolution HPGe detector, radioisotope source, detector elec- tronic system (pre-amplifier, amplifier, high voltage source and multi- channel analyzer), prepared polymer composites, and collimators. The multichannel analyzer connected to the HPGe detector, which has 70 mm crystal diameter, 25 mm active length and 0.380 keV at 5.9 keV,
0.585 keV at 122 keV, and 1.8 keV at 1330 keV resolution, was set to 16384 channels. The experimental studies were carried out at 22 different photon energies between 59.5 keV and 1408.0 keV and under the same experimental conditions. Na-22, Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152 and Am-241 radioisotopes point sources were used for this energy range. The activities of these sources range from 413 kBq to 370 MBq. The detector electronic system was used to create peaks which are proportional to the energy of incoming radiation. The collimators were used to collimate incoming radiation, to prevent the detector from seeing the source directly, and to minimize background counts. The measurements were performed 600 s for the Eu-152 source and 1000 s for the other sources and the counts were kept above 10000 for each related peak. In this way, the statistical uncertainties were kept below 1% for each related peak. More information is presented for the exper- imental details in Akman et al., 2015, 2019c.
3.Results and discussion
The measured linear attenuation coefficient (μ) for the prepared polymer composites with different contents of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 is listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. In addition, in these two tables the theoretical μ values (i.e. XCOM data) (Berger et al., 1998) and the uncertainties in the measurements were added. The obtained results show that the measured μ values for the prepared polymer composites agreed with the XCOM software and this agreement is valid for the composites with different contents of BaTiO3 and CaWO4. For instance,
at 302.8 keV the measured μ and XCOM values for the composite with 10% of BaTiO3 are 0.1563 cm—1 and 0.1567 cm—1, and at this energy the
measured μ and XCOM values are 0.1703 cm—1 and 0.1673 cm—1 for 10% of CaWO4. Furthermore, the following formula was used to esti-
mate the uncertainties in the measurements:@1
where, ΔI0, ΔI, and Δx denote the uncertainties in initial intensity(I0), transmitted intensity (I) and thickness (x). As shown in Table 2, the uncertainties of μ values lie in the range 0.0015–0.0117 for the BaTiO3 (5%) sample, 0.0016–0.0177 for the BaTiO3 (10%) sample, 0.0015–0.0247 for the BaTiO3 (15%) sample, and 0.0016–0.0315 for the BaTiO3 (20%) sample. In Table 3, the uncertainties of μ values lie in the range 0.0015–0.0126 for the CaWO4 (5%) sample, 0.0015–0.0172 for the CaWO4 (10%) sample, 0.0016–0.0241 for the CaWO4 (15%) sample, and 0.0016–0.0269 for the CaWO4 (20%) sample. These values of the uncertainties are very low, which implies that currently obtained μ values for the polymer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 are highly accurate. We also plotted the data shown in Tables 2 and 3 in Fig. 3. For the prepared samples reinforced with BaTiO3 (Fig. 3-a) and CaWO4 (Fig. 3-b), it can be seen that the μ value decreases exponentially
as the energy goes from 59.5 keV to 383.8 keV, and the μ value decreases very slightly thereafter (i.e. for E > 383.8 keV). The present trend in the μ value can be understood according to fundamental nuclear physics
phenomena. Concisely, the photoelectric absorption explains the fast decrease in the μ curves, while Compton scattering is responsible for the trend observed in the μ for E > 383.8 keV (Agar et al., 2019). Also, the figure demonstrates that the maximum μ values occur at 59.5 keV (be- tween 0.5692 and 1.4325 cm—1 and 0.3938–0.7861 cm—1 for the poly-
mer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 respectively. As illustrated in Tables 2 and 3, with increasing BaTiO3 and CaWO4 con- tents, the μ value increases at all energies. This increase in the μ value can be demonstrated by the replacement of Carbon and oxygen in the composite by heavier atoms, namely Ba (for the composites in Table 2) and W (for the composites in Table 3).
The radiation protection efficiency (RPE) for the prepared polymer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 is determined in order to understand the performance of the current composites against the gamma photons. This parameter can be estimated from the emitted and attenuated photons according to the following relation:@2
The RPE gives an indication about the ability of composites to effectively shield against the incoming beam of photons.
Fig. 4 shows the RPE for the prepared composites as a function of

energy and doped ratio. Apparently, the RPE for all composites doped with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 was decreased as the energy rise from 59.5 keV to 1408.0 keV. The maximum RPE values for all the composites doped with BaTiO3 happened at the lowest energy (i.e. 59.5 keV) and lie in the range 47.88–78.16%, while the maximum RPE for those doped with CaWO4 occurred at 80.9 keV (near the K absorption edge of Tungsten, Z
¼ 74) and lie in the range 45.84–73.65%. Moreover, the addition of both dopants (BaTiO3 and CaWO4) increases the RPE values, and this phe- nomenon is clearly observed at low energy. For instance, at 122.1 keV
the RPE increases from 24.46 to 32.07% and from 28.97 to 44.37% as the dopants increase from 5 to 20%. For E > 778.9 keV, the addition of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 had no effect on the RPE values, and almost all composites had nearly the same attenuation ability. For example, at 1212.9 keV the RPE for the 5% BaTiO3 and 20% BaTiO3 are 8.66% and
8.90%, while for 5% CaWO4 and 20% CaWO4 they are 9.26% and 8.99%. The RPE curves imply that the current composites can be used as effective shielding materials for energy less than 511.0 keV, and hence it is suggested that the thickness of the composites could be increased in cases where the samples are to be exposed to photons with high energy.
The half value layer (HVL) is a factor related to the average thickness of the composite needed to minimize the intensity of a beam of radiation by 50%. HVL is expressed mathematically as:@3
In Fig. 5, the HVL curves of the prepared composites are depicted with different amounts of BaTiO3 and CaWO4, respectively. Apparently, for all composites with different amount of the dopants, the HVL shows an increasing behavior as the energy changes gradually from 59.5 keV to 1408.0 keV. The results also demonstrated that the addition of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 decreased the HVL values, especially at low energies. For instance, at 81.0 keV, the HVL values for the composite with 5% and 20% of BaTiO3 are 1.983 and 0.916 cm, and for CaWO4 1.394 and 0.519 cm. This was mostly due to the presence of Ba and W in the composites, which decreased the HVL. Several investigators concluded that the lower HVL the more the attenuated photon transmission for several energies (SinghSandeepKaur and Kaundal, 2014; Chanthima et al., 2012). From these findings, it can be concluded that a thinner sample of polymer composite reinforced with 20% of BaTiO3 or CaWO4 shows better attenuation features than the other samples. Fig. 5 shows that the HVL of the prepared polymer composites reinforced with different amounts of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 depends on the energy of the photon and on the amount of the dopants; in other words, it depends on the density of the composite since the dopants will affect the density value. Also, from the results it can be concluded that the HVL of the polymer com- posites reinforced with CaWO4 is slightly lower than that of the com- posite doped with BaTiO3.
Similar to the HVL, the mean free path (MFP) is a term that describes the distance moved by a beam of photons between two collisions inside the composite material. MFP is a significant factor to consider when

gamma rays. It is expressed mathematically as:

Fig. 6 shows the MFP results of the prepared composites with different amount of BaTiO3 and CaWO4, respectively. According to the analysis of MFP data for the prepared polymer composites shown in both figures, the MFP for the prepared composites depends on the energy and the amount of the dopants. This means that the MFP follows the same trend observed in the HVL curves, and this is clearly shown in Fig. 6. At
59.5 keV, the MFP for all composites has the lowest value (from 0.684 to 1.835 cm and 1.227–2.613 cm for the composites doped with BaTiO3 and CaWO4, respectively). Clearly, the MFP increases almost linearly (especially between 302.9 and 1408.0 keV) with the energy, and the maximum MFP occurs at 1408.0 keV and is equal to 12.560 cm for 20% BaTiO3 and 12.493 cm for 20% CaWO4. As we found in the HVL, the MFP of the polymer composites reinforced with CaWO4 is slightly lower than those doped with BaTiO3.
The effective atomic number values of the prepared polymer com- posites which were composed of different elements were evaluated using the following formula:@5
where, fi, Ai, (μ/ρ)I and Zi denote the fractional abundance, atomic weight, mass attenuation coefficient and the atomic number of ith element, respectively in the prepared polymer composite. Fig. 7 depicts the Zeff curves of the polymer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4, respectively. It can be noticed that the Zeff value is affected by the composition of the composites and that the addition of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 increases the Zeff as shown in Fig. 7. The curves for the Zeff agreed with the observations of Issa et al. (2019), who evaluated the Zeff of polyvinyl alcohol mixed with varying degrees of Pb(NO3)2 at different energies. The Zeff value reaches its maximum at the lowest energy level, and then reduces with further increases in the energy. This is in line with the conclusion of Hine (1952), who proposed that the Zeff of any medium changes with the energy. The polymer composites reinforced with 20% of BaTiO3 and CaWO4 have the highest Zeff, which as can be noticed from the curves. The reason for the high Zeff value for these two com- posites is that the amount of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen in these samples is lower than the other samples, in addition to the high content of Ba (for the 20% BaTiO3 sample) and W (for the 20% CaWO4 sample). On other words, the Zeff shows an increasing trend with the addition of both dopants (BaTiO3 and CaWO4). Besides, the Zeff for the polymerFig. 8. Comparison of the effective atomic number for the BaTiO3 and CaWO4 polymer composite samples.
composites reinforced with CaWO4 is higher than those doped with BaTiO3, since the atomic number of the W is higher than that of Ba (see Fig. 8).
4.Conclusions
The linear attenuation coefficients, radiation protection efficiencies, half value layers, mean free paths, and effective atomic numbers for prepared polymer composites reinforced with BaTiO3 and CaWO4 compounds were determined in the energy range between 59.5 and 1408.0 keV to investigate their gamma-ray attenuation characteristics. Four samples of each group have been prepared by varying the doped material percentage between 5% and 20% with increments of 5%. The obtained conclusions are presented below;
The experimental results of linear attenuation coefficient and other parameters values for the prepared polymer composites agreed with the theoretical results.
The linear attenuation coefficients, radiation protection efficiencies, and effective atomic numbers for prepared composites decrease with increasing photon energy. The half value layers and mean free paths for these samples increase with increasing photon energy.
The linear attenuation coefficients, radiation protection efficiencies, and effective atomic numbers for the tested composites show an increasing trend with the addition of dopants (BaTiO3 and CaWO4). On the other hand, the half value layers and mean free paths show a decreasing trend with the addition of dopants.
Among the prepared polymer composites, BaTiO3 (20%) and CaWO4 (20%) have better gamma-ray attenuation characteristics than the other tested polymer composites. CaWO4 (20%) has slightly better gamma-ray attenuation properties than BaTiO3 (20%).
