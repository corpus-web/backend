abstract
223Ra-dichloride was approved with the commercial name of Xofigo in 2014 for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
223Ra is obtained by neutron irradiation of 226Ra yielding 227Ac, which decays to 227Th and 223Fr, both decaying to 223Ra. Since 223Ra is predominantly (95.3%) an alpha emitter with a 11.42 days long half-life, the radiopharmaceutical, its remnants, the patient, and waste material can be managed and disposed with low radiation protection requirements.
227Ac is a long-lived (T1/2 = 21.77 years) beta emitter that demands strong radiation protection mea-
sures. In particular waste disposal has to follow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and European Commission (EC) regulations. Since 227Ac is involved in the production of 223Ra, an impurity analysis of each batch is required after production. Due to time restrictions, the manufacturer’s detection limit (<0.001%) exceeds the one required to assure that 227Ac concentrations are below direct disposal levels. To improve the detection limit, long-term accurate spectroscopy is required.
Alpha and gamma spectroscopy measurements were carried out at the Complutense University Nuclear Physics Laboratory. After twelve months follow up of a sample, 227Ac concentration was found to be smaller than 10—9. This allows for direct waste disposal and no additional radiation protection restrictions than those required for 223Ra. The presence of contamination by other radioisotopes was also ruled out by this experiment. Specifically 226Ra, involved in 223Ra production as the original parent and with a very long-lived (T1/2 = 1577 years) alpha emitter, was also below the experimental detection limit.

1.Introduction
Cancer treatment using alpha emitters shows several advan- tages. Among them are local energy deposition and high linear energy transfer (LET), which place this treatment as one of  the most promising choices against cancer in the near future [1,2]. Direct alpha particle hits to nuclei of cells in radioresistant tissues can kill those cells, and bound to the right molecules they  can reach specific organ/tissue, leading to effective and precise treatments.
The presence of long lived radioisotopes in the radiopharma- ceutical compound may however compromise its advantages due to stronger radiation protection requirements and their derived costs.Radium-223 (223Ra) dichloride was approved for medical use in 2014 with the commercial name of Xofigo [3,4]. Since then it has become one of the reference treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [5]. This isotope is obtained by neutron irradiation of 226Ra creating 227Ac which decays to 227Th and 223Fr, which decay both to 223Ra [6] (see Fig. 1).
223Ra is predominantly (95.3%) an alpha emitter with 11.42
days half-life [7]. This means that the radiopharmaceutical, its remnants, the patient, and waste material can be managed and dis- posed with low radiation protection requirements.
227Ac is a long lived (T1/2 = 21.77 years) beta emitter [8] that
demands strong radiation protection measures. Specifically waste disposal must follow the International Atomic Energy Agency [9] and European Commission [10] regulations.
Since 227Ac is involved in the reaction chain for the production of 223Ra, an impurity analysis of every production batch is required after production. Due to time restrictions, the manufacturer's

detection limit (<0.001%) is higher than the one required to assure that 227Ac concentrations are below direct disposal levels. To improve the detection limit, long-term accurate spectroscopy is required.
226Ra, the original parent in the production reaction, is also a
long-lived (T1/2 = 1577 years) alpha emitter. Although the manu- facturer’s production process guarantees no 226Ra presence, this must also be confirmed by spectroscopic methods.
The purpose of this study is to analyze the radiochemical purity of the 223Ra-dichloride radiopharmaceutical and to  demonstrate  the absence of long-lived radioisotope contaminants.
2.Material and methods
A theoretical spectrum with different 227Ac initial concentra- tions was calculated for each measurement time as reference for measurements comparisons. Isotope concentrations were calcu- lated using Bateman Equations [11] for all the isotopes present in the decay chain of 227Ac and 223Ra. The 227Ac and 223Ra gamma and alpha emissions tables were obtained from the Bureau Interna- tional des Poids et Measures (BIPM) [12]. Emission intensities were computed using half-lives and decay branching ratios taken from the Lund/LBNL Nuclear Data Search Service [13].
Alpha and gamma experimental spectroscopy was carried out at the Complutense University Nuclear Physics Laboratory. An N- type High-purity Germanium (HPGe) semi-coaxial  (2800 mm2 area, 20 mm thick) detector LOAX 60450-30P-CW from Ortec was used for gamma spectrum characterization. The performance  of this particular detector has been described in detail in [15]. For alpha spectroscopy a ruggedized partially depleted silicon surface
barrier-layer detector 100 mm thick and 50 mm2 of area (Ortec R-015-050-100) was used.
The 223Ra sample consisted of a 0.1 ml volume of 223Ra dichlo- ride from a batch produced by Bayer AS in its Oslo facilities with   a specific activity of 1032 MBq/ml. The sample was diluted with distilled water down to 10% 223Ra concentration to comply with local regulations for manipulation and transportation of radioiso- topes. The source was spread over a microscope glass slide and placed in close contact with the detectors. Measures to avoid con- tamination of the source and laboratory were taken. No other radioisotope was manipulated in the preparation or measurement
area. To ensure absence of contamination background measure- ments were done for a time interval comparable to that of the sam- ple measurement.
An initial measurement was carried out to verify and identify the isotopes present in the measuring sample. Detection efficiency and sensitivity was confirmed with this initial measurement. Dif- ferent measurements along the decay time of Xofigo were made to crosscheck measuring consistency.
A final measurement a year after the production of sample pro- duction was also performed. Indeed, in order to detect 227Ac con- centrations of 10—8–10—9 relative to that of  223Ra,  a  decay  period  of 12 months was allowed for short lived radioisotopes to decay.   A measuring time of up to two weeks (316 h) was used for both alpha and gamma spectroscopy in order to obtain sufficient statis- tical accuracy.
2.1.Spectrum analysis
Theoretical spectra with different concentrations of 227Ac were calculated. They were compared to the experimental data with a gamma analysis test [14].
For detection purposes differences of up to 10% in counts/s, and 5 keV/50 keV in energy channel for gamma/alpha spectrum were allowed. Detection was considered positive if at least 95% of the spectrum points have a gamma value below 1.
3.Results
3.1.Theoretical gamma spectrum
The final gamma spectrum consists of 657 gamma levels as shown in Fig. 2.
The HPGe detector resolution in terms of Full Width Half Max- imum (FWHM) is below 1 keV for gamma energies up to 150 keV and below 2 keV for gamma energies up to 800 keV [15]. Absolute efficiency at a source-detector distance of 5 cm range between
2.22 10—2 to 5.09 10—3 for energies of 30.8 keV–778.9 keV. The the- oretical spectrum takes into account the detector energy resolution and efficiency.
There are several gamma emissions from 227Ac and its descen- dants not included in the 223Ra chain that can be used in the 227Ac

detection. Low energy gamma rays are discarded due to the high presence of background radiation emissions in this range. The most relevant ones in terms of detectability are the 235 keV and the 340 keV gamma levels following the 227Th to 223Ra decay.
3.2.Theoretical alpha spectrum
The final spectrum consists of the 109 alpha levels shown in    Fig. 3.
The silicon surface barrier-layer detector resolution is 19 keV FWHM at 5.486 MeV. Absolute efficiency at a source-detector dis- tance of 5 mm is 15.92%. The theoretical spectrum takes into account the detector energy resolution and efficiency.
In this case the most relevant alpha levels to detect 227Ac pres- ence are the 5.8 MeV and the 6.09–6.15 MeV levels from the 227Th to 223Ra alpha decay.
3.3.Experimental gamma spectrum
The spectra obtained in the initial and final measurement are shown in Fig. 4. The theoretical spectrum at the final measurement time, considering a 10—5 227Ac concentration and taking into account the detector efficiency and energy resolution is also shown in Fig. 4.
The presence of 223Ra in the sample, its concentration and the detector efficiency and resolution were verified with the initial measurement and its corresponding theoretical spectra by per- forming a gamma test. The comparison between the theoretical
and experimental spectrum yielded an accordance of gamma <1 for 98.52% of the points. Points above gamma >1 are located on    the low energy range of the spectrum and are assumed to be due  to background radiation and beta particles entering the HPGe detector through the thin entrance window (E < 100 keV).
Final measurement data was also tested against the theoretical spectrum for different 227Ac initial concentrations. No activity was detected on the 235 keV and the 340 keV energy channels, corre- sponding to no 227Ac presence. Gamma test values from the whole spectrum analysis are listed in Table 1. From this data it can be derived that there is no presence of 227Ac in the sample in concen- trations above 10—8, and that there is no other gamma emitting radioisotope in the sample.
The absence of 226Ra was also confirmed from the non- observation of the 186.2 keV gamma-ray. From the experimental results a detection limit of 10—8 relative concentration to that of Ra223 was found.
3.4.Experimental alpha spectrum
The spectra obtained in the initial and final measurement together with the theoretical alpha spectrum at the final measure- ment date are shown in Fig. 5.
The presence of 223Ra, its concentration and the detector effi- ciency and resolution were verified with the initial measurement and its corresponding theoretical spectrum by performing a gamma test. The comparison between the theoretical and experi- mental spectrum showed an accordance of gamma <1 for 98.52%

of the points. Points above gamma >1 are located on the low  energy range of the spectrum and are assumed to be due to beta particles (E < 50 keV).
From the final measurement data it can be derived that there is no presence of 227Ac in the sample in  concentrations above  10—9. No activity was detected on the 5.8 MeV and the 6.09–6.15 MeV energy channels, corresponding to no 227Ac presence. Gamma test values from the whole spectrum analysis are listed in Table 2. Results are consistent with that of the  gamma  spectroscopy.  It  can also be stated that there is no other alpha emitting radioiso- tope contamination, in particular the absence of 226Ra was also confirmed from the observation of the 4601.0 and 4784.3 keV al- pha channels. A detection limit of 10—9 relative concentration to  that of Ra223 was found.
4.Summary and conclusions
After a twelve months follow up of a Xofigo sample no 227Ac or 226Ra concentration above 10—9 was found. The presence of con- tamination from other radioisotopes was also ruled out with the same detection level after the analysis.
This implies:
Waste material from Xofigo can be managed and disposed fol- lowing just the radiation protection restrictions required for
223Ra.
The absence of Ac and Ra complies with patient and per- sonnel safety requirements.

This substance can be used for investigation purposes such as gamma camera characterization, image formation and quantifi- cation. This can lead to radiation dosimetry of the treatment using 223Ra as imaging source.
