ABSTRACT
In this work, MCNP5 code and Phy-X/PSD software were used to report different shielding parameters for the BaO–Li2O–B2O3 glass systems. The radiation shielding parameters were evaluated for photon energies between 284 and 2506 keV. The mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ) demonstrated a strong energy dependence at the low
energy zone (284 keV<E < 662 keV), while having a weak energy dependence at high energies. The maximum
μ/ρ is found for the glass sample with 40 mol% of BaO and is equal to 0.127 cm2/g at 0.347 MeV and 0.067 cm2/
g at 0.826 MeV. The transmission factor (TF) was determined and the results show an increasing trend as energy increases, implying that more gamma photons can penetrate the BaLiB1 and BaLiB9 glasses at higher energies. For the glass with 40 mol% of BaO, the TF at 0.511 MeV lies within the range of 0.916 (when x = 0.25 cm) and
0.743 (when x = 0.85 cm). It was also found that the TF for BaLiB9 (the glass with 40 mol% of BaO) is lower than
that for BaLiB1. The TF results showed that the greater the amount of BaO in the glass samples, the more efficient the sample will be as a shield. The tenth value layer (TVL) was observed to increase with increasing energy, reaching a maximum value at 2506 keV. The half value layer (HVL) data suggested that with an increase in the
photon energy, a reduction in shielding occurs, improving the penetration of the photons through the BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses. The mean free path (MFP) values varied within the range of 4.046–11.208 cm for BaLiB1 and 1.631–6.814 cm for BaLiB9.

1.Introduction
Radiation is used in medical fields to improve the quality of our daily lives in areas such as cancer therapy, x-ray machines, cardiology, and others. Other fields of work, such as electricity generation and agricul- ture, are highly dependent upon utilizing radiation on a daily basis. As technology continues to advance, radiation will become an essential tool in many more industries and professions (Bagheri et al., 2018; Sharifi et al., 2013; Obaid et al., 2018a, 2018b; Al-Hadeethi et al., 2020a).
Workers and patients may be under great risk if exposed to high amounts of radiation. Ionizing radiation, or radiation with sufficient energy to strip electrons away from atoms, is extremely dangerous when in contact with human tissue (Aygün et al., 2020). Long-term exposure to ionizing radiation can cause permanent damage to skin cells and tissue and can lead to nausea, cancer, and even death (Akleyev, 2016). Radiation shielding materials are necessary to limit the risk of
radiation to people who are commonly exposed to it. These shields must be able to absorb, or attenuate, sufficient amounts of incoming radiation to reduce the level of exposure to safe levels. Therefore, these materials must have a high density, good thermal and structural properties, and ideally also be thin and cost-efficient enough to be a practical material. The most widely used material in radiation shields is lead because of its high density, good attenuation ability, and low cost. Although lead is a very efficient material for shielding, its high toxicity to humans and the environment has led researchers to research into non-toxic alternatives (Rashad et al., 2020; Al-Hadeethi et al., 2020b; Al-Hadeethi and Sayyed, 2020).
Concrete is a common material used to attenuate x-rays and gamma rays with good structural properties and a low cost. Concrete is frequently utilized as a shield against high-energy photons especially due to the fact that increase of its density by change of aggregate type is sufficiently efficient (Zalegowski et al., 2020). However, concretes have
the disadvantage of being immobile and impermeable to light (El Khayatt, 2010). Many types of rocks are found to be dense, compacted and uniform in composition and may have great potential for attenu- ating ionizing radiation. Moreover, rocks are available, cheap and can be shaped into any desired shape and thus rocks can be utilized directly as shielding materials (Obaid et al., 2018b).
Alloys and composites are a combination of different types of metals and commonly have good physical and chemical features. It is easy to enhance the properties of alloys by adding some materials to them. For these reasons, alloys are currently being researched for their use as ra- diation shields (Sadawy and El Shazly, 2019; Kaur et al., 2019). Metallic alloys combine the properties of various metals and can be an alternative to using lead. Polymer composites are light-weight materials with high flexibility and good shielding properties. Due to the low atomic numbers of the polymer materials, they are used in medical physics as tissue equivalents and phantom materials (Kaçal et al., 2019). In addition, ceramics have recently attracted much attention to radiation shielding researchers because of their ability to withstand high temperatures, high resistance to oxidation, low thermal expansion, and low permittivity (Berna et al., 2019).
Glass is another material used for radiation shields because of their ease of fabrication, transparency to light, and doping ability that allows them to become an effective absorbing material. Glass shields can be used in medical rooms, x-ray facilities, nuclear research centers, and other facilities where radiation is utilized (Al-Hadeethi et al., 2019). Various glass formers such as silicon and boron have been investigated for their optical and shielding properties. The addition of heavy metal oxides (HMO) increases the attenuation performance of the glass matrix by increasing the density of the samples (Sayyed and Elhouichet, 2017). To quantitatively measure the attenuation ability of a glass system, several radiation shielding parameters are calculated. The most common parameter utilized in this regard is the mass attenuation coefficient
(μ/ρ). The linear attenuation coefficient (μ) describes the probabilistic
interaction between radiation and matter. It takes density into account to compare materials and determines the absorption ability of any ma- terial with incident photons, and is used to calculate other shielding quantities. Half value layer (HVL) is the thickness of the material in which half of the radiation has been attenuated (Divina et al., 2020). The value is used to determine how much material is needed to reduce the intensity of incoming radiation in half. Mean free path (MFP) is the average distance travelled by a photon between collisions. MFP is affected by the density of the material. When using materials composed of multiple elements, effective atomic number (Zeff) is used to determine the attenuation ability of the sample by understanding the photon penetration in the composite materials (Tonguc et al., 2018; Gaikwad et al., 2018).
In our previous works, we determined these radiation shielding pa- rameters for some glass systems using both experimental methods and Monte Carlo simulation codes (Geant4 and MCNP5) (Al-Hadeethi et al., 2019, 2020a, 2020b; Rashad et al., 2020; Al-Hadeethi and Sayyed, 2020; Sayyed and Elhouichet, 2017). Though, the aforementioned approaches can determine the radiation shielding properties for any medium accu- rately, however, they require certain conditions such as an advanced lab containing some radioisotopes and detectors, access to Monte Carlo code and experts that can carry out the simulations. Therefore, it is better to find an alternative approach to the experimental methods, yet which can still provide similar results. Accordingly, in this work we used Phy-X/PSD software that is available online and can determine the shielding parameters easily with accurate results. In this work, we used Phy-X/PSD software to report different shielding parameters for
BaO–Li2O–B2O3 glass system. For this aim, glasses of the formula 70B2O3-xBaO-(30-x)Li2O (where x 0–40 mol% with increment of 5) were selected and listed in Table 1.

2.Materials and method
The interaction of ionizing radiation with different organs or cells in human beings has long been adopted as a useful tool for radiographic imaging in dentistry and radiotherapy. Additionally, information on the absorption of photon energy is highly important in dosimetry. There- fore, precise values of radiation interaction factors such as buildup factor, tenth value layer, linear attenuation factor and others are required to supply essential information about the composition, density, and thickness of the materials to determine whether they can used as effective shielding materials (Kurudirek and Topcuoglu, 2011). As
mentioned in the introduction, one of the most important factors utilized by radiation shielding investigators is the μ/ρ, which describes how
easily a specific medium can be penetrated by radiation and thus in- dicates the ability of this medium to absorb and attenuate radiation.
Heavy metals such as Pb and Bi have high μ/ρ values and thus it is
preferable for radiation shielding engineers to utilize materials with high densities to increase the μ/ρ and find optimal radiation shielding features for the materials. During the last few years, different re- searchers have calculated the μ/ρ for some glasses using three tech- niques: (a) experimental methods using lead equipment thickness
measurements or transmission geometry (ÇelikbilekErsundu et al., 2019; Halimah et al., 2019), (b) Monte Carlo simulation codes such as FLUKA, Geant4 and MCNP (As¸kın et al., 2019; Al-Hadeethi and Sayyed, 2019) and (c) computer programs such as WinXCom (Gerward et al.,
2004). The obtained μ/ρ can be used to calculate many other parame-
ters, such as for Zeff. There are different methods used to estimate the Zeff for any medium such as the ratio between the atomic to electronic cross-section and the logarithmic interpolation of the atomic  cross-section. These two methods are described in (Sharma et al., 2012). Some computer programs are also a quick method to determine the Zeff for any medium and one of the most common programs in this regard is
Auto-Zeff developed in 2012 by Taylor et al. (2012). The half value layer is another quantity that can be derived from the μ/ρ and represents the distance between opposite sides of the attenuator where the intensity of
the transmitted beam of radiation is exactly 50% of its original value. Therefore, a medium with a small HVL is desired and for this reason nuclear engineers use materials with a relatively high density. Another parameter similar to HVL is the tenth value layer (TVL), both usually measured in mm or cm. Very recently, Sakar and his group (S¸ akar and
O¨ zpolatBünyaminAlım, 2020) developed an online software to deter-
mine all the aforementioned parameters in addition to other quantities such as MFP, effective conductivity, atomic cross section, and others (a total of 18 parameters). This software is called Phy-X/PSD and is
completely free for any investigator or researcher. In a previous study, the radiation shielding features for the BaO–Li2O–B2O3 glass system (Rashad et al., 2020) for five glasses containing different amounts of BaO (between 0 and 20 mol%) was investigated using WinXCom soft- ware. It was found that these glass samples have good radiation
shielding properties. Accordingly, this work aims to extend the previous study (Rashad et al., 2020) by using different software programs (MCNP5 and Phy-X/PSD) and studying the radiation shielding properties for the same glass system but for glass samples with higher BaO contents (up to 40 mol%). Also, in this work the energy range was extended to 2.506 MeV, while in the previous work the shielding pa-
rameters were reported only up to E ≤ 1.33 MeV. Therefore, glasses with the formula 70B2O3-xBaO-(30-x)Li2O (where x 0–40 mol% in in- crements of 5) were selected from (Doweidar et al., 2018). Table 1
summarizes the composition of the glasses in the study. The codes uti-
lized to distinguish between the different samples are BaLiB1 (corre- sponding to x = 0), BaLiB2 (corresponding to x = 5), BaLiB3 (corresponding to x 10),… … BaLiB9 (corresponding to x 40). The increase of the energy from 284 to 2506 keV on the attenuation ability of the BaLiB1–BaLiB9 glasses was investigated. The increase of the content of BaO from 0 to 40 mol% on the attenuation performance was also
reported. Moreover, the effect of changing the density from 2.34 to 3.82 g/cm3 on the HVL and TVL was determined.
3.Phy-X/PSD software
Phy-X/PSD software is a user friendly online software available at htt ps://phy-x.net/PSD to determine different parameters relevant to radi-
ation shielding and dosimetry. PSD is an abbreviation of “Photon Shielding and Dosimetry”. The software can calculate eighteen param- eters related to photon attenuation at specific energy values within a few
minutes. The computational work for any of the shielding parameters of the investigated materials is done in three steps: (i) definition of the materials: in this software, the composition of the material can be defined in mole fraction and weight fraction. There is no limit in the number of compounds or elements chosen. Also, in this step the user
must enter the density of the material in g/cm3; (ii) selection of energies:
two energy zones have been defined in the Phy-X/PSD software, namely 0.015–15 MeV and 1 keV to 100 GeV. Besides, different common radioactive sources such as 133Ba, 60Co, 137Cs, 241Am … etc along with their energies are available in this program and can be chosen by the
investigator; (iii) selection of parameters to be calculated: the users can select which shielding parameters they need to determine according to their study and the applications of the investigated materials. After these three steps completed, the user can save the results in a MS Excel file for
further analysis (S¸ akar and O¨ zpolatBünyaminAlım, 2020). In order to
validate the results obtained from Phy-X/PSD, it is important to compare the mass attenuation coefficients obtained for a certain material by this software with those measured previously in a laboratory or determined
numerically using Monte Carlo simulation codes such as MCNP5 or FLUKA. For this, the MoO3–B2O3–Bi2O3 system was selected (Sharma et al., 2019), in which the authors simulated the mass attenuation co- efficients (μ/ρ) at different energies and compared the μ/ρ for these glasses with the experimental values obtained in the laboratory. In Table 2, the μ/ρ for the MoO3–B2O3–Bi2O3 glass system obtained by FLUKA, experimentally, and by Phy-X/PSD at 4 energies is presented. The data presented in Table 2 shows that the Phy-X/PSD μ/ρ values are very close to those simulated by FLUKA code and measured in the lab.
4.Results and discussion
Fig. 1 presents the μ/ρ for the BaLiB1–BaLiB9 glasses determined by Phy-X/PSD software at various energies between 284 and 2506 keV. The

μ/ρ shows a strong energy dependence at the low energy zone (284 keV<E < 662 keV), while in contrast it shows a weak energy depen- dence at high energies, having values between 0.038 and 0.057 cm2/g for BaLiB1 (as an example). The current behavior of μ/ρ is attributed to various photon interaction phenomena. The maximum μ/ρ is found at 284 keV and is equal to 0.0978, 0.1174, 0.1270, 0.1349, 0.1417, 0.1474,
0.1523, 0.1567 and 0.1605 cm2 g—1 for BaLiB1, BaLiB2, BaLiB3, BaLiB4,
BaLiB5, BaLiB6, BaLiB7, BaLiB8 and BaLiB9 glasses respectively. Sig- nificant differences between the μ/ρ values can be observed in the low energy region. As an example, the μ/ρ for BaLiB3 changes from 0.1270
to 0.0755 cm2 g—1 between 284 and 662 keV and from 0.1605 to 0.0817
cm2 g—1 for BaLiB9. The μ/ρ was found to increase with more BaO was added to the glass matrix. This behavior can be seen in Fig. 1. BaLiB9 has the maximum BaO content and highest μ/ρ, whereas the BaO free glass (i.e. BaLiB1) has the lowest μ/ρ. It is important to mention that the μ/ρ
trend for the selected glasses is in line with the results obtained by WinXCom software for S1–S5 glasses (Rashad et al., 2020) (i.e. BaLiB1– BaLiB5 glasses in this work); however, there are some differences in the
μ/ρ values between the two works due to the difference in the calcula- tions method used in each method. In Fig. 2 the μ/ρ for the BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses were compared with three window glasses at 511 keV.
The composition of type A, B and C glasses can be found in Ref. (Fuochi
et al., 2009; Bootjomchai and Laopaiboon, 2014). The results demon- strated that the μ/ρ of BaLiB1 is almost the same as for type A, BaLiB2 has the same μ/ρ as type B, while BaLiB3– BaLiB9 have higher μ/ρ values than type A, B and C glasses.
In a previous paper (Rashad et al., 2020), it was found that the S2–S5 glasses have a higher μ/ρ than the three A, B and C glasses at 0.248 and
0.347 MeV. In this work, it was found that the glasses with a BaO amount greater than 15 mol%, up to 40 mol%, have a better attenuation ability at 0.511 MeV, which confirms that the glasses can be used in different shielding applications with low (0.248 and 0.347 MeV) and intermediate energies (0.511 MeV).
The μ/ρ for the selected glasses was also determined using MCNP5

code at 0.121, 0.348 and 0.444 MeV and the results were compared with the Phy-X/PSD software in Fig. 3. The method used in the MCNP5 cal- culations is described in other papers (Sayyed et al., 2020; Kaky et al., 2020). In Fig. 3 the MCNP5 vs. Phy-X/PSD data was plotted in order to check the accuracy of the simulation results at the three chosen energies (0.121, 0.348 and 0.444 MeV). It is evident that both methods agree with each other and that the simulated mass attenuation coefficient values are very close to those obtained by the computer program (Phy-X/PSD). We can conclude that the Phy-X/PSD software can be used effectively to determine the radiation shielding properties for the selected glasses with high content of BaO (more than 20 mol%).
The transmission factor (TF) was also calculated, which gives a direct indication about the ability of a glass sample to shield the incoming radiation. The TF for BaLiB1 and BaLiB9 glasses (as an example) was determined at different thicknesses: 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55 and 0.85 cm, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 respectively. These thicknesses were selected since they represent a variety of thin and thick glasses. It is important to mention that a lower transmission factor sig- nifies a more effective gamma-ray shield.

Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate an increasing trend as energy increases. This correlation means that more gamma photons can penetrate through the BaLiB1 and BaLiB9 glasses at higher photon energies. For BaLiB1, the TF at 0.511 MeV varies between 0.952 and 0.847 (when x 0.25 and 0.85 cm respectively). For BaLiB9, the TF at this energy lies within the range of 0.916 (when x 0.25 cm) and 0.743 (when x 0.85 cm). This observation suggests that the higher the thickness of the sample (i.e. x
0.85 cm in this study), the lower the transmission factor, and thus the superior the shield. In practical applications, a thicker gamma-ray shield is more desired since more interactions can occur between the glass and the photons. Moreover, from Figs. 4 and 5, it can be seen that the TF for BaLiB9 is lower than that of BaLiB1. This difference implies that the greater the amount of BaO in the glass samples, the more efficient the sample will be as a shield. In other words, increasing the amount of BaO leads to a reduction in the number of photons that can penetrate through the glass sample.
If the attenuator is composed of different elements or a mixture (such as the glass in this work), its shielding performance can be estimated from another parameter called the effective atomic number (Zeff). Phy- X/PSD software was used to compute the Zeff for the investigated glass

system. Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the Zeff for the investi-
gated samples and other shielding materials (Kaur and Singh, 2019) at 662 keV. The Zeff for ordinary concrete is lower than for the BaLiB1–BaLiB9 samples, and the Z eff for RS-360 is higher than that of all the current glasses. BaLiB7, BaLiB8 and BaLiB9 samples have a higher Zeff than RS-253-G18.
It is worth studying the photon shielding performance of the BaLiB1–
BaLiB9 samples in terms of TVL. TVL represents the thickness of the attenuator for which the incoming photons are reduced to 10% of their initial intensity. The theoretical calculation of TVL can be done utilizing the user-friendly software Phy-X/PSD. The TVL is plotted in Fig. 7. Before discussing the figure, it should be mentioned that for a more desirable protection medium, a smaller TVL is recommended to decrease the thickness required to reduce the levels of radiation to safe levels. This trend occurs because the number of interactions between the incident radiation and the attenuator is high, leading to more attenua- tion and better shielding characteristics. TVL increases with increasing energy, reaching a maximum value at 2506 keV. The lowest TVL occurs at 284 keV is equal to 9.317, 7.691, 6.593, 5.883, 5.209, 4.777, 4.331,
4.049 and 3.757 cm for BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses, respectively. The

maximum TVL is equal to 25.806 cm for BaLiB1. The addition of BaO
reduces the TVL, with BaLiB9 having the least TVL and being considered the best attenuator. This can also be related to the density, since the addition of BaO increases the density from 2.34 to 3.82 g cm—3 and it is known that a denser medium provides more interactions with photons,improving the shielding performance of the medium. When the amount of BaO changes from 0 to 40 mol% (or in other words, the density
changes from 2.34 to 3.82 g cm—3), the TVL reduces from 9.317 to 3.757
cm at 284 keV (i.e a thickness reduction by 40.32%), from 13.160 to 7.855 cm at 0.662 MeV(a thickness reduction by 59%), and from 25.806 to 15.691 cm at 2.506 MeV(a thickness reduction by 60.80%).
Additionally, from a shielding perspective, it is important to deter- mine the thickness of the attenuator necessary to reduce the intensity of the photons to a safe level. If interested in knowing the thickness to reduce the intensity by 50%, then the HVL must be studied. A low value of HVL is preferable for a medium to be an effective shield. The com- puter program Phy-X/PSD has been used to determine the HVL of the
BaLiB1–BaLiB9 glasses. The dependence of HVL on the BaO content has been investigated at nine energies (between 284 and 2506 keV) in Fig. 8.
It can be demonstrated from Fig. 8 that HVL is inversely proportional to the concentration of BaO. Adding more BaO to the glass matrix leads

Fig. 8. The half value layer (cm) as a function of BaO content for the investi- gated glasses.
to a reduction of the HVL. This trend implies that the photon shielding performance for BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses increases when increasing the BaO content. This result can be explained with numerical values. The BaO free sample (i.e. BaLiB1) and the sample with 40 mol% (i.e. BaLiB9) are chosen for this purpose. At 284 keV, the HVL reduces from 2.805 (for
BaLiB1) to 1.131 cm (for BaLiB9), at 826 keV from 4.385 to 2.704 cm and at 2506 keV from 7.769 to 4.723 cm. The dependence of HVL on the content of BaO can be understood from the relation between the shielding ability of the glasses and the density, as discussed in the next parameter (mean free path). It can also be concluded from Fig. 8 that the HVL is an energy dependent parameter. The maximum HVL for all samples can be observed at 2506 keV. This suggests that a thicker sample is recommended to shield high energy photons.
Fig. 9 presents the variation of MFP for the chosen BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses with the density of the samples. In Fig. 9, the MFP values vary
within the range of 4.046–11.208 cm, 3.340–10.268 cm, 2.863–9.509
cm, 2.555–9.007 cm, 2.262–8.365 cm, 2.075–7.975 cm, 1.881–7.467
cm, 1.759–7.175 cm and 1.631–6.814 cm for BaLiB1, BaLiB2, BaLiB3, BaLiB4, BaLiB5, BaLiB6, BaLiB7, BaLiB8 and BaLiB9 respectively. From
Fig. 9, it can be seen that MFP values increase with increasing photon energy and decrease with density increases for the chosen glasses. Among all the glasses, due to it having the highest density, the BaLiB9
sample (ρ 3.82 g/cm3) shows the most effective photon attenuation
performance. This result proposes that greater radiation interactions will occur for a glass with a higher BaO content (i.e., higher density) and at lower photon energies (284 keV in this work). The data presented in Fig. 9 suggests that with an increase in the photon energy, a reduction in the shielding ability of the glasses occurs, improving the ability for
photons to penetrate through the BaLiB1– BaLiB9 glasses. Similar to the
TVL and HVL results, the BaLiB9 sample possesses the lowest MFP values. In general, for a material to be utilized as a proper radiation shield, it must have a small MFP value; therefore, BaLiB9 is the superior attenuator out of the investigated samples.
5.Conclusion
Phy-X/PSD software has been applied to report several shielding parameters such as μ/ρ, TVL, HVL, and others for the BaO–Li2O–B2O3 glass system. The transmission factor was evaluated by applying the
Lambert-Beer law. The μ/ρ for the chosen glasses was determined be- tween 284 and 2506 keV. The μ/ρ shows a strong energy dependence at the low energy region (284 keV<E < 662 keV), while having a weak energy dependence at high energies. The maximum μ/ρ is found for the sample with 40 mol% of BaO. The addition of BaO enhances the μ/ρ values, with the 40BaO–60B2O3 sample having the highest values of μ/ρ. The μ/ρ for the chosen glasses were compared with three window glasses (type A, B and C) at 511 keV and the results demonstrated that the μ/ρ of BaLiB1 is almost the same as for the one for type A, BaLiB2 has the same μ/ρ as type B, while BaLiB3–BaLiB9 have higher values of μ/ρ than type A, B and C glasses. The transmission factor (TF) demonstrates a
decreasing trend as energy increases, which reveals that more gamma photons can penetrate the BaLiB1 and BaLiB9 glasses at higher photon energies. The TVL and HVL increase with increasing energy, reaching a maximum value at 2506 keV BaLiB9 has the least HVL and TVL, and, accordingly, this sample has the best attenuation properties among the present  glasses.  The  MFP  values  varied  within  the  range of
4.046–11.208 cm, 3.340–10.268 cm, 2.863–9.509 cm, 2.555–9.007 cm,
2.262–8.365 cm, 2.075–7.975 cm, 1.881–7.467 cm, 1.759–7.175 cm
and 1.631–6.814 cm for BaLiB1, BaLiB2, BaLiB3, BaLiB4, BaLiB5, BaLiB6, BaLiB7, BaLiB8 and BaLiB9 respectively.
