ABSTRACT
The Haiyang Nuclear Power Plant (HYNPP) was put into commercial operation at the end of 2018, and  the nuclear accident has caused great concern about the environment. In this paper, the improved Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model is used to study the atmospheric migration process of radionu- clides released by HYNPP in a hypothetical accident to assess the potential risks to the public. Firstly, the ground deposition of Cs-137 in the Fukushima nuclear accident during the Fukushima nuclear accident was simulated to verify the model. Then, the atmospheric dispersion, groud deposition process and environmental impact of the radionuclides I-131 and Cs-137 in February and August were  simulated. The  results show that the northwest wind affected accidents in February mainly caused pollution in the southeastern part of HYNPP, including South Korea, western Japan, and Taiwan. However, due to the impact of regional meteorological changes, the surface subsidence and environmental radiation doses received by the Shandong Peninsula are the most serious; the impact of east wind in August will mainly affect the west area of HYNPP, but it also has an impact on Northeast China, the Korean Peninsula region and Kyushu, Japan. The research results are aimed at supporting emergency decision-making of nuclear accidents and improving nuclear emergency response capabilities in surrounding  areas.

1.Introduction
With the increasingly tight international energy supply situation, nuclear power plants (NPPs) have once again attracted the interest of countries due to their low resource consumption, small environmental impact and strong supply capacity. Currently, there are 449 nuclear reactor units in operation around the world (IAEA, 2019). However, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Chernobyl nuclear accident and the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) accident have caused people to pay attention to the possible environmental impacts of nuclear power plants.
More than 80% of radionuclides in the Fukushima nuclear accident were affected by westerly winds that FDNNP headed east and deposited in the Pacific (Estournel et al., 2012; Kawamura et al., 2012). However,
the accident has a wide-ranging impact, and artificial radionuclides have been detected in most countries and regions in East Asia, Siberia, and even the United States, Australia, and continental Europe (Bowyer et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2014; Hoeve and Jacobson, 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Long et al., 2012; Melgunov et al., 2012). In addition to actually monitoring radionuclides, many researchers use numerical simulations to make up for the space-time limitations of observations. Hu et al. (2014) used WRF-Chem to study the atmospheric transport and ground deposition of radionuclides during the Fukushima nuclear accident, and analyzed the sensitivity of physical parameters in the model. Stohl et al. (2012) used WRF-FLEXPART to invert the source term release rate of multiple nuclides in the Fukushima nuclear accident. Huh et al. (2012) used the WRF-Chem model to analyze the impact of radionuclides in the Fukushima nuclear accident on Taiwan through two routes. Sato et al.

(2018) performed a comparison of various models of the atmospheric dispersion of Cs-137 from the Fukushima nuclear accident to understand the atmospheric dispersion behavior of Cs-137 in more detail. Li et al. (2019) developed a method using on-site gamma dose rates with the goal of identifying source terms including long-term and short-term radionuclides, and using the WRF-Chem model to simulate the Fukushima nuclear accident for verification.
The Fukushima nuclear accident indicates that the impact of nuclear accidents due to the rapid and long-distance dispersion of radionuclides in the atmosphere has not only become a regional problem but has also become a global concern. Therefore, many scholars have conducted simulation studies on the large-scale spread of hypothetical nuclear accidents. Zhu et al. (2014) used the Lagrangian model Flexpart to simulate the impact of the world’s first Advanced Passive 1000 (AP1000) unit on the SBO accident in Taishan, China, which will have a serious impact on the environment in eastern China and will affect most countries and regions in Asia. Pirouzmand et al. (2018) used the HYS- PLIT code to simulate the most serious hypothetical SBO accidents and severe cooling water loss accidents at Unit 1 of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant and calculate the facility radius. The concentration of

radioactive material released by the population within 30 km of the facility and the external effective dose were calculated. Birikorang et al. (2015) performed the atmospheric transport modeling using the Hotspot code of Gaussian plumes, and then simulated the radionuclides that Ghana Research Reactor-1 might release. The ground deposition of the radionuclide is determined and the total effective dose equivalent of the released radionuclide is estimated. The researchers used a Gaussian dispersion model to simulate the release of radionuclide in the Fukushima nuclear accident at the proposed nuclear power plant in Malaysia, which would affect the area beyond 80 km (Shamsuddin et al., 2017). It is necessary to use the atmospheric dispersion model to assess the impact of NPP hypothetical accidents on relatively large regions or countries in order to estimate the potential risk to the public.
The Haiyang Nuclear Power Plant (HYNPP) is located in the southern part of Weihai, Shandong Province, adjacent to the Yellow Sea. The 1 and 2 units are the world’s second and fourth AP1000 units, which were put into commercial operation in December 2018 and January 2019 respectively. In our study, the improved Weather Research and Fore- casting Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model (Tang et al., 2019) was used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides and the environ- mental radiation effects of neighboring countries and regions during the hypothetical severe accident at HYNPP. Firstly, this paper uses the Fukushima nuclear accident to verify the improved WRF-Chem model, simulates the atmospheric dispersion and deposition process of I-131 and Cs-137. Then use the model to calculate the HYNPP hypothetical accident, and use the operational intervention levels (OILs) to evaluate the results. Finally, the international consequences of the hypothesis nuclear accident is comprehensively discussed and analyzed.
2.Materials and methods
2.1.Atmospheric dispersion model and ground deposition calculation
In this paper, the improved WRF-Chem model is used to perform atmospheric transport and ground deposition simulation of radionu- clides. The WRF-Chem model is coupled with a physical-chemical module based on the mesoscale meteorological model WRF by the Na- tional Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the US Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) (Grell et al., 2005).

(2019) added radioactive decay behavior in the WRF-Chem solver and analyzed the I-131 regional scale atmospheric diffusion simulation method. In addi- tion, dry and wet deposition parameters were also added separately during the dispersion process. The improved atmospheric dispersion model has been verified by actual data and proved to effectively capture

2.2.Radiation dose assessment and public protective actions
The calculation of the effective dose of environmental radiation in this paper is based on the output of the atmospheric diffusion model of radioactive material. First, the air concentration and surface deposition concentration of the radioactive material are calculated by the model (not related to the concentration in water and food). On this basis, the external effective dose of the radionuclide and the effective dose of the internal irradiation are calculated to obtain the total effective dose, and finally the corresponding emergency measures are determined  accord-ing to the estimated dose value. According to SAFETY REPORTS SERIESNo. 19(IAEA, 2001), the following three effective doses are mainlyconsidered:	The radioactive material distributed in the air near the ground layer
is immersed in the air formed by the person at the interface between the air and the surface. The annual effective dose of air immersion externalirradiation EimðSv =aÞcan be calculated by the following formula:@6
where c is the concentration of radionuclide in the air (Bq/m3), DFimis the effective dose conversion factors for immersion (Sv/a per Bq/m3), Of is the  fraction of the year  for which  the hypothetical critical group
member is exposed to this particular pathway.
The radioactive materials in the atmosphere are deposited on the ground by dry and wet deposition, which is the main cause of external exposure to personnel. The annual effective dose of surface deposition external exposure EgrðSv =aÞ can be calculated by the following formula:@7
where G is the total amount of ground deposition include dry deposition and wet deposition (Bq/m2), DFgris the dose conversion factors for exposure to ground deposits (Sv/a per Bq/m2).
After the radioactive gas or aerosol particles in the air enter the human body through the respiratory tract, the respiratory system and other tissues and organs in the body will be exposed to the inhalation of radioactive materials. The annual effective dose of inhaled internal ra- diation EinhðSv =aÞ can be calculated by:@8
where Rinh is the inhalation rate (m3/a), DFinhis the inhalation dose conversion factors (Sv/Bq).
The total effective dose is the sum of the effective doses of all exposure routes for all nuclides:

where m is the number of species of the nuclide,n is the total number of irradiation routes.Fig. 6. The dry and wet deposition distribution of Cs —137 accumulated from March 11th to 31st (A) MEXT statistics, (B) simulation calculation.
The decay constant, surface clearance coefficient and effective dose conversion factor of I-131 and Cs-137 without regard to the shield are shown in Table 1 (IAEA, 2001).
The release of radioactive materials from nuclear accidents usually requires protective actions and other emergency response actions based on environmental radioactivity monitoring results. Based on the expe- rience and lessons learned from the FDNPP accident, the IAEA published the emergency response preparation and response document IAEA-EPR-IAEA-GSR-2 (IAEA, 2011). By introducing the concept of OILs, the IAEA-GSR-2 (IAEA, 2011). By introducing the concept of OILs, the evaluate the ground deposition of radioactive materials to initiate evacuation, relocation, and or to disable local produce, milk, drinking water, etc., as shown in Table 22.3.Simulation  configuration
2.3.1.Validation of FDNPP
Verification of meteorological field simulation and I-131 dispersion process has been completed in the improved WRF-Chem (Tang et al., 2019). In order to verify the simulation of Cs-137 by the improved model, we simulated the dispersion and deposition of Cs-137 over the 20 days from March 12 to March 31, 2011. The release rate of the Cs-137 source term used in the simulation is based on the (Chino  et  al., 2011), and the detailed release rate per hour is given in Fig. 1.
The simulation domain is shown in Fig. 2, there are three nested areas centered on the Fukushima NPP (37.42�N, 141.03�E). The hori- zontal grid resolutions for domains 1, 2 and 3 are 9 km, 3 km and 1 km, respectively. The entire simulation area is 1000kmX1000km, covering the entire Kanto area. As shown in Fig. 2, we select the Cs-137 near- surface atmospheric activity concentration and Cs-137 deposition data from 6 monitoring stations (No. 1 to 6) in the Kanto region to verify our model. The institutions of the six monitoring sites are responsible for the detection and analysis of the types and concentrations of radionuclides in the local area and to publish data to the public (Amano et al., 2012; Haba et al., 2012; Igarashi et al., 2015; Stohl et al., 2012; Takeyasu et al., 2012; Yonezawa and Yamamoto, 2011).
The meteorological data of the simulated area uses the FNL (final) global reanalysis meteorological field data provided by National Envi- ronmental Prediction Center (NCEP) with a spatial resolution of 1� 1� and a time resolution of 6 h. The initial release height of radionuclides is release of radionuclides observed in the Fukushima nuclear accident is between 20 and 150 m (Chino et al., 2011).
Several quantitative metrics were used to evaluate the validation process, including the mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient(R). The definitions of MBE, RMSE and R are as follow:@10

2.3.2.Location and meteorological conditions of HYNPP
As shown in Fig. 3, in the region where the HYNPP (36.708�N, 121.383�E) is located, China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan are geographically close.
In this study, we used the global meteorological data published by the National Environmental Prediction Center (NCEP) to analyze the monthly 10m wind direction of the HYNPP in the past five years (2014–2018). It can be seen from Fig. 4 that due to the influence of the westerly zone in the mid-latitude region, the dominant wind direction in the autumn and winter (September to March) is the northwest wind and westerly wind, while in the spring and summer (April to August), the southeast wind and the south wind appear in the East Asian monsoon. Therefore, the possibility of a summer nuclear accident affecting mainland China is high, and other seasons will affect the eastern coun-
tries and regions of HYNPP.
2.3.3.Source term and accidental release scenario
The HYNPP is an AP1000 pressurized water reactor in which various radioisotopes are produced during fission and activation. To account for the different behavior of these isotopes in an accident scenario, they are aggregated in groups with similar chemical properties. The amount released to the environment is expressed as the fraction of the total amount of isotopes available in the reactor.

The Source Terms for AP1000 were extracted from the COL Appli- cation for Levy NPP 1 & 2 Environmental Report (Progress Energy
Florida, 2009). In the report, the environmental emission fractions of six hypothetical severe accidents scenario were analyzed, as shown in Table 4. It can be seen from Table 4 that the Containment Bypass(BP) hypothetical scenario 1 releases the largest fractions of radioactivity into the environment.

2.3.4.The case of HYNPP
In order to correctly estimate the impact of hypothetical accidents in HYNPP, according to the accidental scenario analysis of LVNPP, a BP accident occurred in HYNPP, and the dispersion behavior of I-131 and Cs-137 in the atmosphere was analyzed. I-131 and Cs-137 are the key radionuclides released accidentally to the environment by nuclear ac- cidents, I-131 has a large amount of gaseous radioactive pollutants, and its half-life is only 8.3d, I-131 produces high dose radiation equivalent to internal radiation, which is easily absorbed by the human thyroid gland (Calais, 2017). The half-life of Cs-137 is as long as 30.2a, which has the largest contribution to the long-term soil pollution. It mainly enters the
soil surface through the wet deposition process, and is then absorbed by the mineral particles in the soil or migrates down to the deep layer of the soil, resulting in long-term health and environmental issue.
The simulation domain is shown in Fig. 5. There are three nested areas centered on the HYNPP (36.708�N, 121.383�E). The horizontal grid resolutions of domains 1, 2 and 3 are 30 km, 10 km and 3 km respectively, the vertical direction is divided into 43 layers, and the top layer pressure is set to 5000 Pa. As shown in Fig. 5, we selected 10 cities as monitoring points to analyze the dispersion and deposition of radio- nuclides in the case of hypothetical nuclear accidents.
In accordance with the emergency radiation protection standards

established by the IAEA and the International Organization for Radio- logical Protection (ICRP) and other authorities, the week after the ac- cident is the best time to take emergency protection measures. According to the monthly dominant wind direction calculated in Fig. 4, we select the 7 days before the beginning of the month in February 2018 (Northwest) and August (East) as the simulation period. Meteorological field data in the simulated area also uses FNL global reanalysis data from the NCEP.
The source term uses the release amount of I-131 and Cs-137 into the environment when a BP accident occurs, and the total amount is 6.02 � 1017 (Bq) and 6.77 � 1016(Bq), respectively. The release height is at the
lowest level, 0–150m, and it is assumed that the radionuclide is released evenly and continuously every hour during the accident and released within 7 days.
Table 5 The total emissions and during time of I-131, and Cs-137 in the Levy NPP BP accident were compared with the amount of Fukushima nuclear accident emissions compares the total release of source terms and the during time of a hypothetical HYNPP accident and the Fukushima nuclear accident.(Chino et al., 2011; Katata et al., 2012; Stohl et al., 2012).
3.Results and discussion
3.1.Validation studies of FDNPP accident
Fig. 6 is a comparison of the dry and wet deposition distribution of Cs-137 accumulated from March 11 to 31, where Fig. 6 (A) is the data of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) (MEXT, 2011) statistics and Fig. 6 (B) is the result of the simulation calculation. According to the MEXT report, there is a large
amount of deposition on the ground in the northwest direction of FDNPP, and the results of the simulations reflect this very well. In addition, the coverage area of the Cs-137 deposition area is basically consistent with the actual statistics, and the deposition amount of each area is different from the actual difference. This may be because the source term is statistically different from the actual project, and the simulated release rate is released every hour and is related to the ac- curacy of the meteorological field simulation.
Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the air concentration of the six monitoring points Cs-137 and the ground deposition data between actual observations and simulation results, where Takasaki, Tsukuba and Wako did not count ground deposition data. The simulated air concentrations at the six sites were approximately the same as the observed concentrations, and the arrival time of the radionuclide at the site matched the dispersion trend.
For the dispersion process, the first phase is from 00:00 on March 12 to 12:00 on March 14. At this stage, the eastward movement of the extratropical cyclone generated in China affects the northern part of Japan, and the pollutants are stably transported to the east. The second stage is from March 14 to March 17th. The meteorological conditions at this stage are mainly due to the continuous eastward movement of cy- clones in central Japan. The cyclone system changed the dispersion potential of pollutants, allowing pollutants to be transported directly to the southwest, affecting cities in southern Japan, including Tokyo.
For the deposition process, the reason for a large amount of subsi- dence near the Fukushima area was from 17:00 on March 15 to 04:00 on March 16, and rainfall was observed in Fukushima Prefecture (Kinoshita et al., 2011). In addition, from March 20 to 22, a low-pressure system passed through the main island and caused rain in the Kanto region (Tsukuba, Wako, Chiba and Tokyo) from the 20th to the 23rd.
Fig. 10. Cs-137 near-surface dispersion trajectory and air concentration from August 1st to 8th 2018.
Table 6 summarizes several quantitative indicators during the veri- fication process. The MBE, RMSE, and R of the Cs-137 air concentration and ground deposition at the six stations were analyzed and find that the simulation results of air concentrations at stations other than Tokyo were slightly larger. The RMSE of air concentration at all stations is relatively small, all below 50, which indicates that the prediction error is usually equivalent.
The simulation of ground deposition is worse than air, and the overall deviation is substantially higher than air. The RMSEs on the ground are all on the order of 102, which indicate that the simulation
errors are large. This is due to the large change in wet precipitation caused by rainfall.
The correlation was obtained at a significance level of 99%. Except for chiba air and Takasaki deposition, the correlation of the simulation results can reach above 0.7. The results show that the time series of air concentration and ground deposition agree well with the simulated and observed values. In general, the simulation results are within the acceptable range, which proves that the model can be used to study the atmospheric diffusion and sedimentation of radionuclides.
3.2.
Containment bypass accident scenario assessment of HYNPP
3.2.1.Dispersion trajectory and air concentration
According to HYNPP’s dominant wind direction of 10 m on the ground in February, NW, in the event of a severe nuclear accident, the radionuclide will spread to the southeastern sea area. Since the Korean Peninsula region is at the same latitude as HYNPP, it will have less impact on the Korean Peninsula region.
However, in Fig. 8, the radionuclide spreads northward during the period from 01:00 to 18:00 on the 1st, which is affected by the south- ward movement of the low-pressure cyclone in northeastern China. The trend of low-pressure cyclone movement is shown in Fig. 9a-c. After 18:00, the low-pressure cyclone moves to the Chinese mainland. The weakening of the HYNPP area causes the wind direction to change to the NW direction. The radionuclide will begin to spread to the southeast and dispersed to the north. It will affect the Korean Peninsula region and the western region of Japan. In addition, the nuclides that have spread to high altitudes above the ground level will be in the eastern part of the Korean peninsula due to their own subsidence and rainfall, and the concentration of the near-surface layer in the northern part of Japan will increase significantly. As shown in Fig. 9d-e, in the early morning of February 7th, due to the northward movement of the low-pressure

cyclone in the inland areas of China, the wind direction of the HYNPP area changed again, and the nuclide began to spread northward. As the low-pressure cyclone moved away, it began to spread southward at noon on February 7th.
According to the dominant wind direction of the ground 10 m in August, in the event of a serious nuclear accident, the radionuclide will spread to the west of HYNPP, in the inland areas of China. As can be seen from Fig. 10, from 00:00 on August 1 to 00:00 on August 3, the radio- nuclide has been spreading westward, from the early morning of the 3rd to the 00:00 on the 8th, subject to the south wind. The impact began to spread northward. The plume that spread to the north of HYNPP began to spread to the southeast due to meteorological influences in
northeastern China, and began to affect the Korean Peninsula region and western Japan. Therefore, in the case of a serious accident in August, the pollution caused by it was much larger than that in February, and it had
a great impact on the inland areas of China. The area with high air concentration is concentrated in the Shandong Peninsula, reaching 106mBq/m3.  Due to wind speed  limitation in  the  inland areas, the air
concentration is also relatively high, reaching 104mBq/m3, and the air
concentration in other areas is below 103mBq/m3.
The hourly concentration changes of the near-surface I-131 and Cs- 137 at 8 monitoring points in the first 7 days of February and August are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the peak of I-131 in
Weihai reached 4.3 � 105 mBq/m3 in February, and the peak value of
Fig. 13. The a) air immersion external dose, b) surface deposition external dose, c) inhaled internal dose, d) total effective dose distribution from February 1st to February 8th.
Cs-137 reached 4.8 104 mBq/m3. Beijing did not receive the disper- sion of radionuclides, but since 12:00 on February 2, the radionuclide concentration in the air continued to be around 1.5 103 mBq/m3. The
air concentration changes at other observation points were affected by meteorological conditions.
In August, radioactivity spread to surveillance areas other than Shanghai and Taipei. The air concentration in the west of HYNPP was generally  above  103mBq/m3   and  Wuhan  in  central  China  was also
affected, with a wide range of influence. From 00:00 on August 5, the northeastern part of China and the Korean Peninsula were heavily polluted by the southerly winds, and the Kyushu region of Japan was less
polluted. Among them, Weihai, Beijing and Pyongyang have a peak air concentration of 105mBq/m3.
3.2.2.Accumulated deposition of Cs-137
In the case of radionuclide land subsidence, long-lived radionuclides are required because, over time, short-lived radionuclides can drasti- cally reduce radioactivity due to radioactive decay. Due to the short half-life of I-131, Cs-137 generally receives more attention. Cs-137 en- ters the soil surface mainly through the wet deposition process, and is then adsorbed and fixed by mineral particles in the soil, which is difficult to remove by chemical methods. And the half-life is as long as 30.2a, which can cause long-term health and environmental problems. There- fore, in this paper, we analyze the total deposition of Cs-137 in 7 days. The total ground deposition in the first 7 days of February and August is shown in Fig. 12a and b, respectively.
Overall, as expected in February, the northwest wind prevailed to reduce pollution in China and the Korean peninsula, but it may cause pollution depositions in Fujian and Taiwan. In August, due to the
influence of the east wind and the south wind, the large-scale land deposition will be caused. Especially in the North China region, the Korean Peninsula caused a relatively large deposition due to the southward spread of pollutants to the north. But whether it was an ac- cident in February or August, most of the Cs-137 was deposited on the Shandong Peninsula.
3.2.3.Dose assessment and emergency measures
It can be seen from Figs. 13 and 14 that the distribution range of the effective dose of the surface deposition external exposure and the dose value of the central region are much larger than the effective dose of the air immersion external irradiation. The main reason is that the part of the air immersed external radiation dose is caused by radioactive sub- stances in the air, and the accumulation amount of the same spatial position is small due to the fluidity of the wind field and the dry and wet deposition of the radioactive material.
The external deposition of surface sediments is caused by radioactive materials deposited on the surface of the earth. The distribution of surface sedimentary radioactive materials is relatively fixed, and the soil removal rate is low, so it is easy to form a large-area dose distribution. In the actual risk assessment, the health risks of the exposed popu- lation are usually assessed based on the total effective dose(Webster and Thomson, 2011). For example, the annual public effective dose limit of the general public is 1mSv/a. As can be seen from Fig. 12, the land area exceeding the dose limit area in the Shandong Peninsula where HYNPP is located is larger, and the east-west direction exceeds 100 km. The annual effective dose limit for disaster prevention and mitigation workers (such as police and firefighters) is 50mSv/a, and the annual effective dose limit for emergency workers is 250mSv/a.

corresponding to these two limits are small, and the radius is within 50 km of the eastern part of the Shandong Peninsula.
Based on the OIL values of surface depositions, Table 7 lists the emergency measures that 10 monitoring stations should take 7 days after the accident to keep the doses of public and emergency personnel below the established health impact threshold.
For the hypothetical accident that occurred in February, no moni- toring point requires OIL1 measures. The most affected area is the Shandong peninsula in China. From the overall distribution of ground subsidence, OIL1 safety evacuation and ITB measures should be taken within 100 km northwest of HYNPP. Weihai City needs the public to prepare for relocation, while taking action to reduce accidental intake of inadvertent ingestion and stop distributing and consuming local prod- ucts. Shanghai, Taipei, and Vladivostok need to immediately stop distributing and consuming non-essential local products, and replace local agricultural products, milk and rainwater essentials as soon as possible within a few days or if there are no substitutes. Sites in China’s inland areas, South Korea, North Korea, and Kyushu Island in Japan that have not reached the minimum limit of OIL 3 also need to continue to monitor changes in local dose levels and be prepared.
For the hypothetical accident that occurred in August, there is also no monitoring point that requires OIL1 measures. However, OIL1 safety evacuation and ITB measures were taken within 100 km northwest of HYNPP. In addition, most of northern China, Northeast and North Korea, including Pyongyang, also need to be well prepared by the public for OIL2 measures. The public is ready for relocation, while taking action to reduce accidental intake of testosterone and stop distributing and consuming local products. The rest of North Korea and the entire country of South Korea (including Seoul) need OIL3 measures to immediately stop the distribution and consumption of non-essential local products, and to replace local agricultural products, milk and rainwater necessities as soon as possible within a few days or if there is no substitute. Southeastern Russia, Kyushu Island, Japan, and other parts of China that are below the detection limit also need to continue to monitor the local dose, and if there is an abnormality, they need to respond in time.
4.Conclusions
In this study, the improved WRF-Chem model and NCEP’s FNL meteorological data were used to estimate the radiological impact of a severe accident assumed by China’s Haiyang nuclear power plant on the surrounding area. Firstly, we simulated the FDNPP accident to test the performance of the WRF-Chem model in calculating the atmospheric dispersion and deposition of radionuclides. Then, based on the five-year weather data of HYNPP, we hypothesized that HYNPP had a severe BP
accident in February and August 2018, and calculated the potential impact of the released radionuclide on surrounding countries and re- gions, and analyzed data from 10 monitoring points. Finally, the con- sequences of the accident were analyzed by deposition, concentration and dose assessment. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1)In the case of a simulated FDNPP accident, the simulated air concentration and ground deposition distribution of Cs-137 are well matched to the actual measured data. This indicates that the improved WRF-Chem has a good evaluation of the atmospheric dispersion and deposition process at the radionuclide regional scale and can serve nuclear emergency work well.
(2)In the case of HYNPP, a complete and high-precision meteoro- logical field is calculated by inputting a large amount of meteo- rological data through three layers of nested simulation area settings. The simulated February wind direction is mainly concentrated in the northwest wind, which dominates the diffu- sion of radionuclides released by HYNPP to the southeastern sea. The winds in August were mainly concentrated in the east and south winds, and mainly affecting the western part of HYNPP, but also affected the northeastern region, the Korean Peninsula re- gion and Japan’s Kyushu.
(3)Among the 10 monitoring points, Weihai is most affected by
nuclear accidents due to its geographical proximity to HYNPP. According to the simulated deposition data, the accumulation of Cs-137 is up to 103 Bq/m2, which requires long-term tracking. In
addition, it is found that dry and wet deposition may be the main sedimentary mechanism of the Korean Peninsula. Although the radioactive clouds diffuse through the Korean peninsula, the dry
deposits and effective doses of hot spots are caused by air tur-bulence, and affected by rainfall, more than 500Bq/m deposits on the Korean Peninsula.(4)The dose assessment showed that 10 monitoring points did not need OIL 1 emergency measures, but from the distribution of land subsidies, safe evacuation and ITB measures should be carried out within 100 km northwest of HYNPP. In the February scenario, Weihai needs to take OIL 2 measures, Vladivostok, Shanghai and Taipei need to take OIL 3 measures. In the August scenario Weihai, Jinan, Beijing and Pyongyang, need to take OIL 2 mea- sures, Seoul needs to take OIL 3 measures. At the same time, other monitoring sites should continue to monitor.
