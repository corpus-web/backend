Abstract
Radiation-chemical stability of ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] has been investigated under gamma irradiation for Nd2O3 separation from simulated spent nuclear fuels. It was found that Nd2O3 dissolution decreases with increasing absorbed dose of [Hbet] [Tf2N]. However, the dissolution ability of irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] to Nd2O3 can be regenerated after washing with water. The radiolytic products of [Hbet][Tf2N] were identified by EMI–MS, and [Hbet]+ group occurred a little radiolysis during irradiation. The UV–Visible spectra shown an increase in absorption around 275 nm probably due to the radiolysis of [Hbet] [Tf2N]. FTIR spectra shown little variation around 1730 cm−1 under high radiation dose.

Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs), which have been widely promoted as “green solvents,” are attracting much attention for appli- cations in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing due to their unique properties, such as low volatility, flammability, greater radiation stability and wider electrochemical win- dows and so on [1–7]. Brønsted acidic ionic liquids are emerging as most promising alternatives, as they have use- ful characteristics of both solid acids and mineral liquid acids [8, 9]. They also can be designed to replace traditional mineral liquid acids such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid in chemical processes. In addition, they are highly tun- able, soluble in a wide range of organic solvents, and often reusable. [Hbet][Tf2N] as a common Brønsted acidic ionic liquid has a functionalized carboxylic group in its cationic part, which has the ability to coordinate with metal ions [10–12]. [Hbet][Tf2N] has been used to dissolve rare-earth oxides from various media [13–16] and separate some metal ions [17–20]. Recently, carboxyl-functionalized ionic liq- uid [Hbet][Tf2N] was used firstly to separate the neutron poisons, lanthanide oxide as well as some fission products from simulated spent nuclear fuel by the selective dissolu- tion [21]. However, the radiation stabilities of ionic liquids are crucial in evaluating their potential application in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing [22, 23].
If ionic liquids are to be successful in their application for highly radioactive materials, there will be a requirement for them to be robust high radiation dose. Many works have investigated the radiation stability of different ionic liquids using various methods [23–29]. A preliminary assessment of the α, β, γ-radiation effect on imidazolium cation based  hydrophilic ionic liquids showed that these ionic liquids had relative high radiation stability [23–25]. Ao et al. studied the effect of gamma radiation on the carbonyl-functionalized task-specific ionic liquid [HOOCCH2MIN][Tf2N] as a sol- vent and extractant in extraction of UO22+ [30]. They found that UO22+ could not be extracted into the organic phase when the radiation dose exceeds 100 kGy, which indicated that [HOOCCH2MIN][Tf2N] underwent radiolytic decom- position. Shkrob et al. used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the radiation stability of task-specific ionic liquids [31, 32]. They regarded that antioxidant organic cation deprotonation from the excited state was reversible and lead to minimal task-specific ionic liquids damage. The physical properties of carboxyl-functionalized [Hbet][Tf2N] and other ionic liquids have been evaluated after gamma radiation, and the results shown that these ionic liquids were sufficiently stable when irradiated up to 100 kGy [33]. Our previous work has shown that carboxyl-functionalized [Hbet][Tf2N] is an extremely attractive candidate to selec- tively separate neutron poisons, lanthanides oxide from

spent nuclear fuel [21]. Therefore, the radiation effect on [Hbet][Tf2N] for lanthanides dissolution and analysis of radiolytic products need to be further researched before practical application.
Herein, the effect of gamma radiation on this ionic liquid betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Hbet][Tf2N] was performed to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the stability and to assess its potential practical application in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. The selective dissolution of Nd2O3 from simulated spent nuclear fuel was investigated using irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N]. The radiolytic products of [Hbet][Tf2N] were identified by 19F nuclear magnetic reso- nance (NMR) and high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS), respectively. The UV–Vis absorption spectra and FTIR spectra of irradiated [Hbet] [Tf2N] samples were also analyzed. The investigation of radiation stability and radiolytic products of functionalized task-specific ionic liquid are important, which can be used for design of radiation-resistant ionic liquids.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were commercially available  and  used as received, without further purification. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTf2N) (> 99%) were purchased from Lanzhou Green ILs, LICP, CAS (Lanzhou, China). Betaine hydrochloride (HbetCl) (99%) and Nd2O3 were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Tianjin China) with AR degree. UO2 samples were obtained from China North Nuclear Fuel Co., Ltd. (Baotou, China). Water was always of ultrapure quality, deionized to a resistivity of > 18.2 MΩ cm with a Milli-Q® Academic ultrapure water system.
Methods
The simulated spent nuclear fuel was prepared by mixing amount of UO2 with Nd2O3 powder [21]. The method for preparing carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] (Fig. 1) has been previously reported [10]. Gamma radia- tion test was performed at Tianchen Irradiation Technology Co. Ltd. (Lanzhou, China). The Cobalt 60 Gamma Facil- ity was used as the gamma source. The ionic liquid [Hbet] [Tf2N] sealed in the polypropylene tube were exposed at

room temperature to different doses of gamma irradiation at a dose rate of 1.93 kGy/h. The dose rate was measured using UV–Vis spectrophotometry by B3 Windose dosimeter [34]. The dissolution and separation experiments were performed according to the procedure previously reported [21]. The ESI–MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker micro TOF Q II spectrometer in the positive ion and negative ion mode. 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 Avance III HD NMR spectrometer operated at 400 MHz. The samples were prepared by dissolving a small amount of product in d6-DMSO. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of ionic liquids were obtained from a Thermo Evolution 300 UV–Vis spec- trophotometer with 1 cm path length cells. FTIR spectra of the ionic liquids were recorded using a Bruker Tensor 27 FITR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES; Agilent, type 5100SVDV) with an axial plasma configuration.
Results and discussion
Influence of the radiation effect on the Nd2O3 removal by irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N]
The water-saturated [Hbet][Tf2N] has a good selective dis- solution ability for lanthanides oxide without additional chemical agent from spent nuclear fuels [21]. In the nuclear fuel cycle, ionic liquids will be exposed to high radiation dose from radioactive actinides and fission products. There- fore, in order to assess the practical application of this ionic liquid, the influence of γ-irradiation on the selective disso- lution of lanthanides oxide by water-statured [Hbet][Tf2N] and [Hbet][Tf2N] solid from simulated spent nuclear was studied, respectively.
Figure 2 shows the influence of absorbed dose on the selective dissolution of Nd2O3 by [Hbet][Tf2N] from simu- lated spent nuclear fuel. The Nd2O3 dissolution was evalu- ated under two different test conditions. First, the irradiated water-saturated [Hbet][Tf2N] was used directly. The dis- solution of Nd2O3 decreases with increasing of absorbed dose, as displayed in Fig. 2. Second, the irradiated [Hbet] [Tf2N] solid with a little water (about 13–14%) was used.
Fig. 2 Influence of absorbed dose on the dissolution of Nd2O3 and UO2 from simulated nuclear fuel
This because the content of water is about 13% in the water- saturated [Hbet][Tf2N] from references [15, 21]. A similar result was found in dissolving Nd2O3 under these two dif- ferent test conditions (Fig. 2). The lanthanide oxide Nd2O3 can be completely dissolved by irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] from simulated spent nuclear fuel when the absorbed dose was less than 40 kGy. The dissolution of Nd2O3 has still 60% yield even the absorbed dose reach 72 kGy. Obviously, the decline of Nd2O3 dissolution is related to the irradiation of [Hbet][Tf2N]. These results suggest that the radiolysis of ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] interferes with the Nd2O3 dissolu- tion. Nevertheless, it is good that UO2 matrix dissolves in irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] still with a relatively small amount compare with lanthanide oxide.
In addition, another experiment was also carried out to validate the regeneration of [Hbet][Tf2N] after water wash- ing. The irradiated water-saturated [Hbet][Tf2N] was washed with deionized water before dissolving Nd2O3. Then these samples were used to dissolve Nd2O3 from simulated nuclear fuel. Compared with the lower dissolution (about 22%) for Nd2O3 at 105 kGy in Fig. 2, the dissolution of Nd2O3 increased to 95% after water washing. This result indicate that the dissolution ability of irradiated ionic liquid [Hbet] [Tf2N] toward Nd2O3 can be recovered after washing with water. Hence, it can deduced that the radiolytic products of irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] are water-soluble. This phenomenon is similar to the work on [HOOCCH2MIN][Tf2N] [30].
To further verify the radiolytic products of [Hbet][Tf2N] can be washed, the [Hbet][Tf2N] solids were subjected to  a high radiation dose and then inspected the regeneration of [Hbet][Tf2N]. Firstly, we found that the [Hbet][Tf2N] solid became into a pasty state as the gamma absorbed dose increased. This implied that some water-soluble radiolytic products formed during the gamma radiation. Subsequently, the irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] solids were dissolved with enough deionized water and the regenerated water-saturated

[Hbet][Tf2N] were obtained after removing the upper aque- ous phase. The experiment was implemented through employing these regenerated water-saturated [Hbet][Tf2N] and the result was shown in Fig. 3. As anticipated, the Nd2O3 was almost completely dissolved by [Hbet][Tf2N] when the absorbed dose was less than 276 kGy. This is mainly due to the fact that the water-soluble radiolytic products from [Hbet][Tf2N] were removed in advance. However, the dis- solution efficiency of Nd2O3 reduced to about 20% when the absorbed dose exceeds 400 kGy. This indicated the [Hbet] [Tf2N] underwent significant degradation under high radia- tion doses. The ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] lost its dissolution ability to Nd2O3 after irradiation. Hence, this carboxyl-func- tionalized [Hbet][Tf2N] may not be an attractive candidate to selectively separate neutron poisons, lanthanide oxide in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.
Identification of radiolytic products
According to the above experimental results, [Hbet][Tf2N] underwent degradation under high irradiation dose. The irra- diated [Hbet][Tf2N] at different dose was analysed by NMR and electrospray ionization (ESI+ and ESI−) mass spectrom- etry to verify and identify the radiolysis of [Hbet][Tf2N]. Figure 4 shows the high-resolution ion ESI–MS spectra in positive ionization mode of [Hbet][Tf2N] before and after irradiation at 105 kGy. Several peaks with a relative high intensity at 235.1664, 516.0925, 633.1716 and 914.0987 are visible for the original sample and are attributed to the asso- ciation of cations with [Hbet][Tf2N] in clusters (Table 1). As illustrated in Fig. 4, new signals at 177.1592 and 400.0790 are observed in the ESI–MS spectra of irradiated [Hbet] [Tf2N]. These products at m/z = 177.1592 and 400.0790 were designated for radiolytic products of [Hbet]+ (Table 1),

which were identified as [[bet][NH(CH3)3]]+ (P1; theoreti-
cal exact m/z is 177.1603) and [[Tf2N][(CH3)3NH]2]+ (P2; theoretical exact m/z is 400.0799), respectively. Although the ESI–MS measurement in the present work is not a quantitative method, it clearly indicates that the intensity of the signals at 400.0784 increases relatively with increas- ing absorbed dose (see in the ESI†). The formation of [(CH3)3NH]+ indicated that the carboxyl groups of [Hbet] [Tf2N] fragmented during irradiation. In fact, the dissolu- tion is driven by the reactivity of the carboxylic acid group located on the cation of the ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] [10, 11]. Therefore, radiolysis of cation [Hbet]+ effected Nd2O3 dissolution to a certain degree. The radiolysis mode of [Hbet][Tf2N] with gamma irradiation was similar to that of [HOOCCH2MIM][Tf2N] of Ao et al. [30].
The negative ionization mass spectra (see in the ESI†) shows a strong intensity peak at m/z = 279.9191 corre- sponding to [Tf2N]−. Although there are no further peaks appeared in the negative ionization mass spectra, the radioly- sis of anion [Tf2N] cannot be excluded. As it was mentioned above, some water-soluble radiolytic products formed during irradiation. According to references [30], the radiolysis of anion [Tf2N] leads to the formation of water-soluble radio- lytic products. 19F NMR analysis did not find the radiolysis of anion [Tf2N] as literature reported [30], may be due to the relatively lower radiation dose. 19F NMR spectra of [Hbet] [Tf2N] ionic liquid are similar before and after irradiation. Only a peak at − 78.74 ppm was observed corresponding to [Tf2N]− (see in the ESI†). Because NMR signatures (chemi-cal shift and coupling constants) of some species includ-ing  fluorine group are  very  close to  that of the singlet at
78.74 ppm [24, 26], it is difficult to identify these radiolysis products using this technique. It was possible that the radi- olysis of anion [Tf2N] was not observed due to the very low intensity and poor resolution of these radiolytic products in this work. Nevertheless, it is the fact that the radiolysis of [Tf2N] anion results in the formation of water-soluble radiolytic products.
Characterization
The colour of the ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] has almost no change before and after irradiation, no matter what [Hbet] [Tf2N] is solid or water-statured solution. This phenomenon is different from some reports, which found that the colour of some imidazolium ionic liquids changed obviously after irradiation [26, 28, 35]. However, the solid [Hbet][Tf2N] changed into a pasty state at higher radiation dose. This clearly indicated that the water-soluble radiolytic products formed during the irradiation. Although the colour of the irradiated water-statured [Hbet][Tf2N] samples does not changed, the dissolution ability was effected after irradia- tion. Herein, FITR and UV spectra of [Hbet][Tf2N] before and after irradiation were compared.
In order to analyze the irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] samples, UV–Vis spectra of the irradiated water-irradiated [Hbet] [Tf2N] were measured. As shown in Fig. 5, the maximal absorption wavelength (230 nm) of ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] did not change before and after irradiation. However, a new broad shoulder around 275 nm for the sample of irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N] was appeared, and this absorption became

more intense with increasing dose. The change trend of UV absorbance for [Hbet][Tf2N] is similar to that observed for some imidazolium based ionic liquids [25]. Hence, it can deduced that this new absorption peak came from the radi- olysis of [Hbet][Tf2N]. However, radiolysis of [Hbet][Tf2N] did not lead to form coloured radiolytic products due to the aliphatic structure.
The FTIR spectra of unirradiated and irradiated [Hbet] [Tf2N] are shown in Fig. 6. The comparison showed no dis- tinct changes in all spectra. The strong and sharp absorp- tion band at 1730 cm−1 is mainly attributed to the stretching vibration of C=O of COOH group. The slight peak at around of 2900 cm−1 was observed corresponding to the stretch- ing vibration band of –CH3. A group of intense bands in the range of 1000–1400 cm−1 were assigned to the vibra- tions of  [Tf2N] anion [36, 37]. Very  little difference was observed in the FTIR spectra of unirradiated and irradiated [Hbet][Tf2N]. It was found that a broad shoulder at  around 1730 cm−1  appeared in the high dose irradiated sample (491 kGy). This probably indicates that the –COOH group of [Hbet][Tf2N] undergoes a certain radiolysis.
Conclusions
The selective dissolution of Nd O by irradiated ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] from simulated spent nuclear fuel was inves- tigated. The present result shown that the dissolution effi- ciency of Nd2O3 was effected by absorbed dose of [Hbet] [Tf2N]. The radiolytic products of [Hbet][Tf2N] were water- soluble. The selective dissolution ability of [Hbet][Tf2N] towards Nd2O3 can be recovered after water washing. The UV–Vis spectra show an increase in adsorption around 275 nm probably due to the radiolysis of [Hbet][Tf2N]. The changes in the FTIR spectra of [Hbet][Tf2N] are very small before and after irradiation. Due to the poor radiolytic stability of the ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf2N] investigated, it is not suitable for the applications in the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. Therefore, further researches on the screen- ing the relatively radiation resistant agents are underway in our laboratory.
