ABSTRACT
In this paper, we report on the design and implementation of a compact and robust Compton spectrometer capable of measuring x-rays in the energy range 1 to 20 MeV. An iterative reconstruction method was employed to reconstruct the x-ray spectrum without assuming an initial distribution function. Spectral resolution was further optimized by judicious choice of composition and thickness of the electron-convertor, as well as angular acceptance into the spectrometer. A particle transport code was used to account for all instrument-related factors. Performance of the spectrometer was demonstrated experimentally by characterizing x-rays generated by high-order multiphoton Thomson scattering.

1.Introduction
Laboratory high-energy X-ray sources have recently been developed to enable research in the emerging areas of nuclear photonics and ultrafast X-ray science. However, the relatively low repetition rates of these sources has prompted the development of a new generation of X-ray spectrometers, which can spectrally resolve the relevant photon energy levels extending from 1–20 MeV with a low duty cycle (single- shot exposure). Because such energetic X-rays penetrate deeply in matter, conventional spectrometers, such as those based on photon dispersion, are impractical. Diffractive methods [1] also do not work, since they require higher, but less efficient diffractive orders. Transmis- sion/absorption methods [2] have severely limited resolution because the mass absorption/attenuation coefficient varies slowly with respect to incident X-ray energy, and single-photon counting methods require both attenuation of the signal to the single-photon level and multiple identical exposures.
To circumvent these limitations, spectrometers which utilize the Compton effect [3] have recently been proposed and validated. They work by encoding information about the X-ray spectrum into scattered electrons. After producing scattered electrons, the X-ray spectrum can then be extracted by taking advantage of the fact that (1) the electron spectrum can be easily measured by means of a dispersive magnetic electron spectrometer, and (2) the photon elastically scatters off an electron in the Compton process, resulting in a linear energy transfer from the photon to the electron.
In recent work [4–10], forward-scattering was used to transfer the X-ray energy to the electrons. Since this geometry has highest scattering probability, it leads to the most sensitive measurement. As shown in Fig. 1, a beam of X-ray photons impinges upon a low-Z target, called  a Compton Convertor (CC), and emits Compton-scattered electrons. The spectral distribution of these electrons is dependent on the X-ray distribution and the CC properties. In the ideal case for a single- photon/electron model, the reconstruction of the X-ray energy from  the scattered electron is straightforward, but once beam-effects and finite thick target are introduced, finding the appropriate unwrapping algorithm becomes nontrivial.
Two approaches were previously used to reconstruct the X-ray spectrum from a simulated CC model [4,6]. Both approaches require assumptions of a functional shape of the X-ray distribution. They also require either adjustment of several free parameters to fit the model, or estimates the X-ray distribution from the peak electron energy emitted from the CC. These techniques have the drawback that they can mask special features in the X-ray spectra. Such drawbacks can be seen in the simplest case when considering the measurement of a narrow- band X-ray spectrum, for which the previous methods will incorrectly overestimate the energy spread [4]. The drawbacks in the previous methods introduce systematic uncertainties that limit the choices of the CC and furthermore the types of measurements that are possible.
In this paper, we describe the demonstration of a novel spectrometer that employs a reconstruction algorithm that is able to overcome these limitations. It utilizes a simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) [11], a method which is standard in the field of tomography. Unlike previous implementations, it does not require an assumption   of a functional shape of the reconstructed spectrum, and it does not lead to degradation of the spectrometer resolution. Furthermore, we also present a design of an experimental Compton spectrometer thatFig. 1. This flowchart describes the key points of the logical method used in Compton spectroscopy. In such measurements, an X-ray beam interacts with a target known as   a Compton convertor and emits electrons through Compton scattering. The spectral distribution of the emitted electrons contains information about the initial X-ray spectrum, which can be recovered by the application of an unwrapping algorithm.
takes into account the advantages provided by the new reconstruc-  tion method. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this method  by measuring X-rays spanning the spectral range of 1–20 MeV, pro- duced with an all-laser driven inverse-Compton scattering (ICS) source operated in high-order multiphoton scattering regime.
2.Overview of the Compton scattering process for efficient mea- surement of MeV photon spectra
In what follows we briefly describe the basics of the Compton scattering process and its application to the measurement of MeV photon  spectra. The Compton  effect is treated as a  collision  between
an incident photon with energy E and propagation direction 𝑘̂  = 𝑘⃗ ∕ |𝑘⃗ | |⃗(where  𝑘  is  the  momentum  vector),  and  an  electron  at  rest.  This  is propriate when we work in an energy regime where 𝐸 ≫ 𝐸𝑏 (the binding energy of an electron in an atom). The result of such a collision   is a photon with new energy 𝐸′ and propagation direction 𝑘̂ ′, and an electron with acquired kinetic energy 𝑇  with propagation direction 𝑞̂. If we only consider the case of an elastic collision, the kinetic energy
of the scattered electron can be written as a function of the incident
photon energy E, and the scattering angle 𝜃  which is measured between    the unit vectors 𝑘̂ and 𝑘̂ ′:
@1
where 𝛾 = 𝐸∕𝑚𝑒𝑐2. The differential Klein–Nishina formula provides the cross-section for the scattering of photons from electrons and can be
written as a function of the kinetic energy of the scattered electron [12]:@2
𝑆 (𝐸, 𝜃)   =   𝑇 (𝐸, 𝜃)∕𝐸,  𝑟e   –  the  classical  electron  radius,  and  𝑚e   the electron mass (MeV/c2).
As can be seen from Eq. (1) and Fig. 2a, in the range of energies from 1–10 MeV, 𝑆 (𝐸, 𝜃) remains approximately constant for a scattering angle  of  𝜋  ±  .5  rad  (the  forward  scattering  regime  for  the electron).
We can also see from Eq. (2) and Fig. 2b, that on the range from 0–2𝜋  there  is  a  maximum  at  𝜋.  Even  though  the  differential  cross- section  diminishes  for  increasing  energies,  this  maximum  remains  at
𝜋 which indicates that the most likely event is a photon backscattering interaction which leads to the electron having nearly the kinetic energy
of the incident photon.
From these two observations we see that the emitted electrons from a Compton convertor have roughly the same energy as the incident photon, and are scattered primarily in the forward direction with an interaction cross-section that decreases as energy increases. In an ideal
broadening of the X-ray spectrum. This broadening leads to a measured resolution for the spectrometer that is larger than the real resolution and limits the accuracy of the measurement.
To get around these disadvantages, we approach the reconstruction as a linear inverse problem. Such problems occur in many areas of physics, and a multiplicity of tools have been developed to address them, one of which is the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Tech- nique (SIRT). SIRT is a ‘‘brute force’’ approach that works by making an initial guess, then creates a simulation of the results based on the known physical interactions, and then compares this answer to the  measurement. The difference between the answer and the measurement is then used to make a new guess, and the process is repeated until     the difference becomes negligible. To describe how we applied the SIRT  algorithm  to reconstruct the  spectrum of  the X-ray  beam  in  a
Compton spectrometry scheme, let 𝑔𝑥  𝐸𝑥   be the p(ho)ton distribution
which one could infer the initial photon energy. However, in practice, multiple scattering of the electrons will occur before they exit the con- vertor. The number of scattering events for a given convertor thickness
∝ 𝑍4∕3  where Z is the atomic number of the convertor [13], suggests that a thin, low Z material is ideal as a convertor in the Compton spectrometer [4,5,9]. Furthermore, for 𝐸     2𝑚𝑒 the incident photon can interact with an external nuclear field and produce electron positron
pairs with  a net kinetic energy that is consistent with the  conservation    of momentum and energy. The cross section of this interaction 𝜎𝑝𝑝 ∝ 𝑍2 again  reinforces  the  decision  to  use  a  low-Z  convertor.  The inclusion
of multiple-scattering and pair production makes the analytical deter- mination of spectrometer parameters nearly impossible since these are stochastic processes. Therefore, we use instead the Monte-Carlo code GEANT4 (and the FTFP_BERT physics list) [14–16] which includes the above effects [17] to build a response function that models the system response to input X-ray energies. Validations of Compton scattering in the GEANT4 code has been done for photon energies in the MeV energy region [18].
3.Reconstruction of arbitrary X-ray spectra
Spectrometer response functions built using Monte-Carlo methods are crucial in all attempts to reconstruct X-ray spectra from a measured Compton-scattered electron distribution. For example, in a previous attempt to reconstruct X-ray spectra by Kojima et al. [6], the initial X-ray distribution was approximated as a sum of three Boltzmann distributions and the convertor responses were predicted through sim- ulations and optimized to match the measured results by varying the free parameters of the distributions. A different reconstruction method was used in Corvan et al. [4] that does not require the assumption       of a functional shape for the X-ray spectrum. Instead, it relies on response functions based on simulations that are performed for a set   of monoenergetic pencil X-ray beams with variable energy and from these responses, two dependencies are extracted — peak energy of the electron beam and peak of the conversion factor (electrons to X-rays) as functions of initial X-ray energy. Based on these dependencies, an electron spectrum can be converted one-to-one to an X-ray spectrum.
As mentioned previously, these methods suffer from a lack of gen- erality. In the first case, constraints are placed on the X-ray spectrum itself, which can hide interesting details  about  the  distribution.  In  the second case, assumptions made about the linear response of the
convertor can introduce systematic errors that are only avoided by constraining types of CC’s to stay within a specific regime. To under-stand the implications of these assumptions, first let us consider the
extreme case where a purely monoenergetic X-ray beam is measured. In this case, the interaction of the X-rays with the CC will create a scattered  electron  beam  with  an  energy  spread  due  to fundamental
broadening effects in the converter. In the reconstruction process, each
into an energy component of the X-ray spectrum, which would result in
broadening of the X-ray spectrum. This broadening leads to a measured resolution for the spectrometer that is larger than the real resolution and limits the accuracy of the measurement.
To get around these disadvantages, we approach the reconstruction as a linear inverse problem. Such problems occur in many areas of physics, and a multiplicity of tools have been developed to address them, one of which is the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Tech- nique (SIRT). SIRT is a ‘‘brute force’’ approach that works by making an initial guess, then creates a simulation of the results based on the known physical interactions, and then compares this answer to the  measurement. The difference between the answer and the measurement is then used to make a new guess, and the process is repeated until     the difference becomes negligible. To describe how we applied the SIRT  algorithm  to reconstruct the  spectrum of  the X-ray  beam  in  aCompton spectrometry scheme, let 𝑔𝑥  𝐸𝑥   be the p(ho)ton distribution
of the X-rays, passing through a convertor, and 𝑔𝑒n scattering from the X-rays in the convertor material. This transformation can then be
defined as 𝑔    𝐸     =     𝑔   𝐸    𝑠	𝐸  , 𝐸   𝑑𝐸 , where 𝑠	𝐸  , 𝐸    is a
transformation core which we will refer to as a basis. The goal of our

analysis is to reconstruct 𝑔  𝐸  by knowing 𝑔   𝐸   and we implement this using SIRT. For a finite basis, the integral is replaced by a sum and

lations where monoenergetic X-ray beams in the range of 1 to 20-MeV
in .25-MeV steps interact with a convertor material as shown in Fig. 3.
If 𝑔𝑒𝑖 and 𝑠𝑥𝑒𝑖𝑗 are known, then SIRT gives us an iterative way to reconstruct

To test the reconstruction procedure, we used GEANT4 to create a series of test cases. In this paper, we demonstrate two of them – a case of a broad X-ray spectrum and a case with a narrow one. For each case, we started with realistic X-ray beams (their spectra are shown in Fig. 4a and d with solid curves) and obtained simulated Compton-scattered electron beam spectra (shown on Fig. 4b and e with solid curves). We then performed our iterative procedure until the procedure converged. At this point, the reconstructed X-ray distribution (shown in Fig. 4a and d with red crosses) perfectly matched the input X-ray spectrum, and the reconstructed electron beam distribution, which resulted from the inversion algorithm, (shown on Fig. 4b and e with red crosses)  also perfectly matched the test electron spectrum. The dynamics of  the
convergence are shown on Fig. 4c and f, where vertical axes show (𝑔(𝑞)−𝑔(𝑞−1))∕ max
– the normalized maximum difference between the X-ray spectra of the current and previous iteration. The results of the
reconstruction obtained with the peak method [4] are also shown in Fig. 4a and d (blue circles) for comparison.
Fig. 4 makes it evident that the iterative reconstruction method    we present is superior to the previously used peak reconstruction, especially for narrow-band X-ray spectra. While peak reconstruction gives reasonably good results for broad X-ray spectra (see Fig. 4a),      it significantly overestimates the widths of the X-ray spectra when
they are narrowband (see Fig. 4d). We estimate the uncertainty of the SIRT method to be <5% (FWHM) by verifying the method’s ability to reconstruct a monoenergetic photon’s response to the CC.4.Generation and optimization of spectrometer response
The previous sections of this paper have demonstrated the need for a Compton-scattering spectrometer, described the basic physics of such a system, and laid out a method for recovering an X-ray spectrum from Compton scattered electrons. In this section we will lay out the practical implementation of a Compton spectrometer which utilizes the concepts shown above with the purpose of the measurement of laser-produced X-rays. We will then briefly describe the optimization process for the selection of spectrometer parameters while also considering the added benefits of SIRT in such measurements.
4.1.Compton spectrometer experimental layout
The layout of the Compton spectrometer design we used is shown
in Fig. 5. It is comprised of three pieces: the input aperture, the CC–aperture. In each of these pieces, the relationship between the reso-
lution and electron yield of the resulting signal are inversely related. For example, the entrance aperture into the CC collimates the incident beam reducing the incident angular spread at the cost of electron yield. The choice of CC material itself lies on a large parameter space within this relationship where one must consider the interaction length of    the photon energies of interest. We used GEANT4 to create a virtual spectrometer to investigate the interplay of the parameters shown in Fig. 5 to determine the resolution and yield of the spectrometer system. Since the effects of the input aperture are highly source dependent, we limited our study to the effects of the CC material type and thickness, and the specific electron collimation aperture that was used for the input into the electron spectrometer.
4.2.Convertor type study
material type and longitudinal thickness, and the electron collimation To study the convertor response, we simulated 106 mono-energetic X-rays in a pencil beam geometry. The incident X-ray energy was
varied, and we recorded the energy of electrons incident upon a 10-   cm x 10-cm ideal detector. Lithium (Li), Beryllium (Be), and Carbon
(C) were all chosen for this study since they are low-Z. Subsequently, we chose the thicknesses of these materials such that they had similar yield for ∼2-MeV X-rays. The results of the simulation were normalized to the incident photon number and histogrammed in 10-keV bins and  is shown in Fig. 6.
From these simulations, we found that the lower-Z materials af- forded higher resolution, yet the peak electron number decreased for
incident X-ray energies >4-MeV. In the range from 2 to 20-MeV the FWHM  as  defined  as    𝐸+1∕2 − 𝐸−1∕2   ∕𝐸       decreased  monotonically from for both the 2-mm Beryllium and 8-mm carbon CC’s as shown in
Fig. 6c. We also found that for both the Li and Be samples the total

charge emitted from the CC reached a maximum anywhere between    5 and 10-MeV. This was not the case for the C samples. This was not the case for the C samples where, as can be seen from Fig. 6d that
the electron yield increases still for incident photons with E >10-MeV.
This agrees with the theoretical prediction that as Z and E increase,
there will be more multiple scattering events and electrons produced through pair production. From these results, we can make a choice on
what convertor type is best suited for the measurement. For example,  if a measurement of 15-MeV X-rays is needed, one could choose the 2-mm Be sample which has a narrowly peaked distribution of emitted electrons at this energy. In some cases, the initial signal level could be low enough that very small amounts of charge will be emitted from  the CC. In these situations, it would be wise to choose a convertor   that increases the measured signal. If we instead chose the 8-mm C

convertor, we would have a signal level more than 4 times larger compared to Be but with a wider spectral distribution.Li would have similar benefits to Be, but we chose to not use it since in its pure form,
Li is pyrophoric. The intrinsic deficit in the resolution could be made up through the reconstruction method presented previously in this paper and therefore we chose to use the 8-mm C convertor.
4.3.Electron aperture study
The electron aperture, as shown in Fig. 5, exists for the purpose    of transporting the forward-scattered electrons into the magnetic spec- trometer and to also limit the entrance angle into the magnetic spec- trometer. To study the impact this has on the final yield and spectrum of the Compton-scattered electrons we included both  entrance  and exit lead apertures and included a real beam geometry with defined source size and divergence. To represent X-rays produced by laser– matter interactions, the source was modeled as a Gaussian profile  with
𝑟𝜎  =  1.27-μm  and  angular  distribution  with  the  divergence  angle 𝛩𝜎  =
1-mrad. The origin of this source was placed 250-cm from the entrance
to the spectrometer system depicted in Fig. 5, beginning with the lead input aperture in which a cylindrical void with a 4-cm diameter and 10-cm longitudinal thickness was created. Next, guided by the results presented in the convertor type study, we chose to specifically study CC’s of 8-mm C, and 2-mm Be followed by two types of electron aper- tures  modeled  again  as  voids  in  lead  at  2.54-cm/.635-cm (1′′/1/4′′)
the physical implementation of the Compton spectrometer, and finish with a discussion of the results of this measurement.
5.1.X-ray source properties
The experiments were performed with the DIOCLES laser [19] at the Extreme Light Laboratory at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The DIOCLES laser is a Ti:sapphire chirped-pulse-amplification system that allows for 6 J of 800-nm laser light with a pulse duration of 35     fs to be delivered to a target at a repetition rate of .1-Hz. We divided the primary beam by use of a 50:50 beam splitter and sent each to         a separate compression grating pair which allowed for independent control of each pulse. One beam (drive beam) was used to produce relativistic electron beams in the energy range of 200 to 350-MeV by laser-wakefield acceleration [20–22]. The second (scatter beam) was focused by an f/2 off-axis parabola to a spot size of 4.8-μm (1/e2) on the electron beam which generated a synchrotron-like X-ray spectrum [23, 24] via high-order multiphoton Thomson scattering (HMTS) [20]. The endpoint energy of this X-ray spectrum can be predicted in theory by
width and 15-cm length. A sample of 107  photons with energies of 6
and 12-MeV was propagated through the system and the final kinetic
the following equation, 𝐸𝑐 = 𝑛𝑐 𝑀0𝐸0, where 𝑛𝑐 = 3𝑎3∕4  is the highest
energy of electrons within a 2.54-cm × 2.54-cm region centered on the
harmonic number accessible, 𝑀0  = 𝛾2 (1 + 𝛽0)2 ∕(1+𝑎2∕2) encompasses
was chosen to match the dimensions of the entrance into the magnetic spectrometer used in the experiment. The resulting distribution was histogrammed in 100-keV bins and renormalized to the peak electron number for 2-mm Be in the 1′′ aperture case because this was the case
that had the highest peak electron density.
The resulting spectra  as  shown  in  Fig.  7a,  show  that including a collimating aperture reduced the peak of the electron density that arrives at the input of the magnetic spectrometer while increasing the lower energy tail. Fig. 7b–e also shows that the spatial distribution for both convertors appears similar for the smaller aperture size. We can see from these results that the addition of an electron aperture reduces the overall yield of electrons making it to the magnetic spectrometer while also broadening the peaks of the electron energy distribution produced from the CC. Since the SIRT reconstruction method can overcome this added deficiency and we want to optimize for single- shot measurements at high-energy, we deemed it best to choose the CC which affords higher yield. We can see that this is indeed the case if we again look at Fig. 6d and consider that adding a 1′′ aperture reduces  the total yield for the carbon CC by 25%, and 46% for the beryllium CC at 6-MeV, the total yield for the carbon CC is still 20% larger   than the yield for beryllium, which furthermore justifies the choice of implementing carbon over beryllium. It is also clear that the electron aperture size is dictated by the desired resolution of the magnetic spectrometer, as a larger entrance aperture leads to degraded spectral resolution. A careful balance must be struck between the parameters mentioned in this and the previous sections in order to make the desired measurement, and in our case, the application of the SIRT technique reduced the entire set of parameters such that we chose to use an 8- mm carbon CC. For the electron aperture we chose to use a 1∕4′′  spacing in order to limit the entrance angle into the magnetic spectrometer to be ±20-mrad. If we had instead chosen a 1′′ spacing, the resolution of the magnetic spectrometer would have suffered from a 4-fold increase in the opening angle, thereby dramatically degrading its resolution. Using these results, we then built a basis to be used for experimental measurements (see Fig. 3).
5.Spectroscopy of laser-produced, MeV-energy X-rays
In this section, we describe the application of a physical Compton spectrometer that we developed using the results from the previous sections in order to measure MeV X-rays generated by the process of high-order multiphoton Thomson Scattering. We will first lay out the parameters of the novel X-ray source, followed by the parameters of
before  scattering,  𝛾0   –  the  relativistic  Lorentz  factor  of  the  electron
beam,  𝛽0   –  the  fractional  speed  of  light  of  the  electron  beam,   and
𝑎0  =  .85 × 𝜆  [μm] ×   𝐼  [W∕cm2]  the  normalized  vector  potential  of  the
scattering laser [23]. The scatter beam energy [20,25] was adjusted, such that 𝑎0 ranged from 2 to 12. This was independently verified by separate measurements [20,26]. We expected from the theory that the
maximum photon energy produced through HMTS would lie in the broad range from 2 to 52-MeV, thus motivating the development of this type of spectrometer.
5.2.Experimental methods
We measured the X-ray spectrum of the HMTS X-ray source in two different ways. First, we measured the spectrum on a single-shot basis. We then performed a measurement in which many shots were accumulated in order to improve the signal-to-noise. For both cases, we used the setup depicted in Fig. 5 which began with a 0.9-T cleanup magnet to deflect stray electrons produced by the interaction of the X-rays and the vacuum chamber window, followed by a 4-cm diameter collimating aperture placed 1.165-m from the source. The 8-mm carbon CC was directly placed after this. A 0.635-cm-wide x 15-cm-long void between lead bricks was then used as an electron collimating aperture, which limited the solid angle of the electrons incident into the magnetic spectrometer to ±20-mrad. The magnet, used to resolve the electrons spectrally, was characterized by a 1000-point field map including fringe fields. A particle tracking code (GPT) [27] was used to construct deflection curves for two cases: electrons passing entirely through the magnet and electrons with low enough energy that they were dispersed along the side of the interior of the magnet. Since the average field strength of the magnet was measured to be 0.2-T, this corresponds to electrons with energies from 1–4.8-MeV being deflected to the side face of the magnet and electrons from 5–20-MeV leaving forward face of the magnet, the high end of which was instrument-limited due to the field strength and signal from the unattenuated X-rays. Phosphor image plates (IP) were placed on the top edge and at the exit of the magnet. The photo-stimulated intensity levels (PSL) were recorded offline and since the IP’s response is linear for electrons with this energy, the    PSL value correlated directly with the charge incident upon the detec- tor [28,29]. A voxelated Cesium-Iodide (CSI) scintillating array with 1600-pixels and imaged by a 14-bit EMCCD measured the unattenuated beam at the exit of the Compton spectrometer as an online diagnostic of the beam quality.
All measurements were performed in air to reduce the exposure- readout time since the image plates must be read offline. According

5.3.Experimental results
In the multi-shot acquisition mode, 20-shots were taken with the same scatter beam intensity and then recorded offline by an IP reader. This acquisition was repeated using different scattering beam intensi- ties. Data was taken similarly in the single-shot mode, with the success of the shot determined by the signal shown by the CSI array. This correlation was vital due to the inherent instability of the overlap between the electron beam and scattering laser.
The Compton scattered signal was differentiated from the back- ground on the IPs using null tests (no scattering beam) and portions   of the IP outside of the direct exposure of the beam. From this signal we were able to determine the average signal level as a function of deflection distance across the IP which is shown in Fig. 8a. Once we have this signal, we then used our magnetic spectrometer calibration  to reconstruct the electron spectral distribution as seen in Fig.  8b. Since we estimate that the input angle into the magnetic spectrometer was the most significant contributor to the measurement uncertainty, the spectrum is represented as bands which correspond to the input angles of ±20-mrad. Finally, the X-ray spectrum was reconstructed
from the electron spectrum via SIRT and a basis created using the real spectrometer parameters described above. The results are shown for both the multi-shot and single-shot modes in Fig. 8c,b respectively and agree with each other which is to be expected.
If we then look back to the theory presented in Section 5.1 and  consider the results in Fig. 8c,d we can see that the spectrum is indeed synchrotron-like and has energies extending well beyond what would be generated from a single harmonic. Consequently, the measured cutoff energy Ec can then be used to estimate the total number of harmonics produced in the scattering event. In both datasets, Ec can be estimated by enforcing a strict cutoff at the noise-floor. For the multi-
shot data, we estimate that level to have the value of 1.4 × 103𝛾∕MeV and for the single-shot data we estimate that level to be 1.4×102𝛾∕MeV. Ec  is then calculated by finding where both sides of the error bands
cross these values and then taking the midpoint of the two values and the width of the band at this position is then taken as the uncertainty   of the measurement. The result of this analysis is presented below in Table 2.
6.Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a new method to measure the spectrum of MeV energy X-rays that overcomes limitations imposed by prior methods and enables high-resolution single-shot spectroscopy. Our method is based on a novel application of the well-known SIRT algorithm. Using Monte-Carlo simulations as a guide, we optimized parameters such as the convertor material type/thickness  and  elec- tron collimating aperture size to design a spectrometer with enough characteristics in the spectral region of interest. We then applied this technique to measure MeV energy X-rays from a new laser-driven X- ray source operated in the regime of high-order multiphoton Thomson scattering. The physical spectrometer paired with the SIRT based algo- rithm allowed us to reconstruct the X-ray spectrum to distinguish end
point energies >9-MeV with an instrument-limited resolution <25%  in
a single exposure. Our method can be extended in future to newer X-ray
sources that operate at higher photon energy, especially laser-driven sources operated at a significantly higher intensity than at present.
