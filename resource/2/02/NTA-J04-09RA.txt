Abstract
The exportation of fast reactors under an international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime is dis- cussed. Russian sodium fast-reactor technology has been successfully demonstrated and is in the commer- cialization stage. Fast reactors with lead as coolant are being developed in Project Breakthrough. In this connection, the possibility of exporting fast reactors becomes logical. The main criterion for such exports is competitiveness of the electricity produced taking the possibility of offering other, additional services into account. Other criteria that undoubtedly will influence the decisions made about exports are elements as- sociated with the need for strict adherence to the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime. The basis of this regime is the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty. The IAEA system of safeguards plays a key role as a control element in verifying the obligations of non-nuclear states in the sphere of nu- clear non-proliferation.
At the current stage of development, in the world a consensus has been reached on the dominant role of fast reactors in future large-scale nuclear power. In addition to the key role of such reactors in supplying fuel in the face of a native uranium shortage, as examined previously, a reduction of the volume of spent nuclear fuel from thermal reactors within the limits of two-component nuclear power is now becoming an important element of the use of fast reactors. Russian sodium fast-reactor technology has been successfully demonstrated and is now at the stage of being commercialized. In this connection, the ex- portation of fast reactors to countries which do not possess such technologies could become possible some time in the future. This subject was first proposed for discussion at an IAEA international conference on fast reactors, which was held in Paris (France) in 2013 [1]. This was followed by an announcement by the Rosatom State Corporation that the Russian technology of fast reactors and a closed nuclear fuel cycle could appear on the international market in 10–15 years as an export product of the nuclear power industry [2, 3].
All this determines the need for an analysis of the exportation of NPP with fast reactors, including nuclear fuel and their nuclear fuel cycle facilities taking into account the technical and economic performance figures of the power-generating units as well as the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime system.
The present article is a continuation of the scrutiny of the exportation conditions started in May 2018 as part of a working group consisting of representatives of Rosatom organizations. The working group prepared the conclusion “Conditions for the exportation of power-generating units based on fast-neutron reactors and facilities for an in-plant nuclear fuel cycle taking nuclear weapons nonproliferation requirements into account,” which was examined at a meeting of the Presidium of the Scientific and Technical Council of Rosatom on December 26, 2018, taking into account remarks made by representatives of Rosatom itself and Rosenergoatom as well as scientists from industry-sponsored scientific research institutes and institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The present article continues the discussion of the main elements characterizing the place of fast reactors in the future nuclear exportation in the context of adherence to the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime.
Advancements in the sphere of fast reactors. Currently, our country is the only country in the world where pow- er-generating units with fast reactors are present in the structure of nuclear power. This was achieved as a result of the suc- cessful assimilation of fast reactors with sodium as the coolant. Beginning with the first experimental fast reactor BR-1, started up in 1955 at the IPPE, a series of similar reactors, the latest of which operated up to 2002 (BR-10), was created. These facilities were used to study the physics of fast reactors and perfect the handling of the sodium coolant. The BN-350 demon- stration power reactor operated for 25 years. The BOR-60 research fast reactor has been operating at NIIAR since 1969 and continues to fulfill its functions. The BN-600 reactor has been operating in a commercial regime since 1980 at the Beloyarskaya NPP. The BN-800 reactor commissioned in 2016 at the same NPP is intended for perfecting the elements of a closed NFC using mixed uranium-plutonium fuel.
The finishing work on the high-power fast reactor BN-1200, which is being positioned as the main unit of a commer- cial fast reactor, is now in the final phase. In terms of economic characteristics, it is close to the figures for the 3+-generation modern VVER-1200 thermal reactors. In accordance with the arrangement of electric power plants in the country, before 2030 the main power-generating unit BN-1200 will be built at the Beloyarskaya NPP. A centralized arrangement of the closed-NFC infrastructure for servicing fast reactors has been adopted as the main variant.
Another direction of lead-cooled fast reactors and an in-plant closed NFC infrastructure is being developed as part of Project Breakthrough. To demonstrate this technology, a power-generating unit with a pilot-demonstration reactor BREST- OD-300 is to be built at the site of the Siberian Chemical Combine. A pilot demonstration power complex with the entire in- frastructure of the closed in-plant nuclear fuel cycle is to be built on the same site.
A multi-purpose fast research reactor MBIR is to be built on the grounds of NIIAR in 2020. The first concrete for this reactor was poured in September 2015. In addition to the main avenues for the development of high-power fast reactors, the development of the modular fast reactor SVBR with coolant based on the eutectic lead–bismuth is continuing.
Significant attention is also being devoted to scientific-research and design work in the sphere of closed NFC for fast reactors and nuclear power as a whole. In particular:
–the production of mixed uranium plutonium fuel for fast reactors has been assimilated at the Mining and Chemical Combine;
–the second phase with capacity of 250 t/yr is to be commissioned in 2021–2022 at the experimental demonstration center for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at the Mining and Chemical Combine; the first phase with capacity 5 t/yr is intended for perfecting the reprocessing of spent fuel from VVER-1000;
–experiments on separating americium and curium from the spent nuclear fuel and americium from curium for sub- sequent transmutation in fast reactors were successfully performed in 2015;
–a technology for reprocessing spent fuel from fast reactors is being developed in two directions at VNIIKhT: hy- drometallurgy and pyrochemistry;
–reprocessing of spent fuel from VVER-1000 was started at PO Mayak at the end of 2016;
–experimental FA were delivered for irradiation in the MIR reactor and the reactor of the No. 3 unit at Balakovo NPP; the experimental fuel is a regenerated mixture of uranium and plutonium, separated from the spent fuel of thermal reac- tors, with added enriched uranium.
On this basis, it can be supposed that currently fast reactors and their fuel cycle are entering the final stage of their development – the commercialization stage.
Criteria for the exportation of fast reactors. It appears that one of the main criteria for evaluating the possibility of exportation will be the competitiveness of the electricity produced by such reactors taking into account the possible offering of additional services in the form of the production of radioactive isotopes or valuable metals present in the spent fuel. A factor of no small importance in this evaluation will be the possibility of substantially reducing the volumes of high-level waste in combination with new technologies for reprocessing spent fuel.
Other factors that will undoubtedly influence decisions on the exportation of fast reactors as an independent object as well as with the corresponding facilities for their closed nuclear fuel cycle will be requirements associated with strict adher- ence to the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime. In addition, it must be kept in mind that neither the nucle- ar weapons non-proliferation treaty nor the IAEA system of safeguards nor the agreements of nuclear supplier groups, which are the most important barriers to the propagation of nuclear weapons, nor the exportation control system of the Russian Federation directly prohibit the exportation of fast reactors, nuclear fuel, and their NFC facilities for peaceful uses [4].
At the same time, some experts believe that the exportation of fast reactors to countries that do not possess nuclear weapons, especially with facilities supporting their closed fuel cycle, is inadmissible because of the high risks of violation of the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime. This judgement is of recent origin. Actually, fears that the separated plutonium in the nuclear energy sector could be stolen and/or diverted to the manufacture of nuclear weapons first appeared in the USA at the beginning of the 1970s. Plutonium getting into the hands of terrorist groups or state structures of countries that can conduct secret armaments programs appeared to be extremely dangerous. Studies performed by the Ford Foundation led to the conclusion that the reprocessing of spent fuel with separation of plutonium leads to a serious danger  of nuclear weapons proliferation. This was soon followed by a decision of the Carter administration, announced on April 7, 1977, that the USA would cancel plans for reprocessing spent fuel and curtail and then phase out work on fast reactors. And, the negative image of fast reactors remained for a long time even though an international assessment of the nuclear fuel cycle made during the period from October 1977 to 1980 with the participation of more than 500 experts from 46 countries con- cluded that the danger of diversion of nuclear material at the early stages of the nuclear fuel cycle of fast reactors is no greater
than in the case of the uranium-plutonium cycle of light-water reactors [5].
The indicated ‘memory factor’ can seriously influence assessments of the place of fast reactors and fuel cycle facil- ities in peaceful nuclear power. For this reason, the problem of the risk of violation of the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime in connection with exportation of fast reactors requires a separate study. In this connection, it is pertinent to examine the possibility of introducing into their design, while preserving the economic competitiveness, technical elements that on the one hand impede the use of the fast reactors themselves and the facilities of the nuclear fuel cycle in order to produce nuclear materials suitable for developing nuclear weapons or any nuclear explosive devices and on the other hand assist the application of IAEA safeguards.
Correctly, in accordance with the provisions of the guiding principles of the nuclear supplier group, which are reflect- ed in the nuclear exportation control system of the Russian Federation and take account of the provisions of the nuclear weapons non-proliferation, the exportation of the facilities and objects indicated in the initial list or corresponding technology must be conducted only when certain conditions are met. One of them is the presence of official government assurances of the importing country concerning the use of the acquired products exclusively for peaceful purposes and clearly excluding their use for creating any nuclear explosive devices for peaceful or non-peaceful purposes.
A factor of no small importance in the determination of the possibility of exportation of fast reactors and closed fuel cycle facilities will be their maximum suitability for meeting the effective IAEA safeguards. Currently, IAEA has prepared recommendations for taking the IAEA safeguards into account in the designs of nuclear facilities, including fast reactors. Taking IAEA safeguards into account at early stages of design and construction of a nuclear facility makes it possible to mit- igate the need for additional development work on an operating facility, as well as to reduce the cost of implementing IAEA safeguards. There exist three basic categories of elements which are the key for implementing the IAEA safeguards and must be taken into account in facility designs:
–verification of information on the design of a nuclear facility;
–verification of the accounting and physical presence of nuclear materials, including the performance of required measurements; and
–application of conservation and surveillance measures.
The following must also be taken into account in facility design:
–presence of backup/emergency power for servicing equipment intended for the purposes of safeguards;
–requisite access and space for servicing equipment intended for the purposes of the safeguards;
–minimization of radiation exposure of inspectors and equipment;–access for verification of design information, for example, to pipelines;
–minimum risk of damage to safeguard equipment or losses of data pertaining to the safeguards;
–adequate lighting for IAEA inspectors and implementation of video monitoring; and
–presence of unique identifiers for each item containing nuclear material.
At the same time, the fact that IAEA actively works on a new approach to implementing safeguards with the main control measures being transferred from the facility level to the government level must be taken into account. This approach is based on processing of all accessible information as well as analysis of ways to acquire nuclear materials suitable for cre- ating nuclear weapons or any nuclear explosive devices. In this connection, even at an early stage of the development of possible exportation to a country not possessing nuclear weapons, fast reactors with facilities or without facilities securing a closed fuel cycle, it is desirable to establish interaction with IAEA in order to workout approaches to applying the safeguards in the importing country.
Conclusion. To date, the developed international tools make it possible to regulate the exportation of nuclear mate- rials, facilities, and technologies between countries in order to perform nuclear activities exclusively for peaceful purposes and to verify country responsibilities adopted in connection with such activities. Considering the forthcoming commercializa- tion of fast reactors the time has come to systematically analyze the problems associated with the possible exportation of power-generating units with fast reactors and their nuclear fuel cycle facilities. Apparently, the problem lies in finding a place for such power-generating units in peaceful nuclear power taking into account economic factors and nuclear weapons non-pro- liferation factors. Of course, it is not the prohibition of the exportation of nuclear reactors that will serve to reduce the risk of the propagation of nuclear weapons but rather the combined efforts of the countries exporting such facilities and IAEA to improve the design of such reactors and measures for safeguarding the new facilities.
In this regard, the research performed by American specialists in 2007 showed that an effective approach to safe- guards for new fast reactors can be developed on the basis of the recommendations used in the Monju fast reactor (Japan) as well as those determined for purposes of increasing the efficiency of safeguards for the next-generation fast reactors [6]. Many of these recommendations pertain to approaches to safeguards for reprocessing facilities and facilities for fabricating mixed uranium-plutonium fuel.
Summarizing, it should be noted that the problems associated with the possibility of exportation of nuclear power units with fast reactors in terms of the technical-economic aspect as well as in connection with the adherence to the interna- tional nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime await their solution already in the near-term future and require the combined efforts of physicists, engineers, economists, and specialists in the sphere of IAEA safeguards and the international nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime.
