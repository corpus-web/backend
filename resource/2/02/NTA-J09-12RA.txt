ABSTRACT
The silicon-photomultiplier (SiPM) is becoming the device of choice for different applications, for example in fast timing like in time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) and in high energy physics (HEP). It is also becoming a choice in many single-photon or few-photon based applications, like for spectroscopy, quantum experiments and distance measurements (LIDAR). In order to fully benefit from the good performance of the SiPM, in particular its sensitivity, the dynamic range and its intrinsically fast timing properties it is necessary to understand, quantitatively describe and simulate the various parameters concerned. These analyses consider the structure and the electrical model of a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), i.e. the SiPM microcell, and the integration in an array, i.e. the SiPM. Additionally, for several applications a more phenomenological and complete view on SiPMs has to be done, e.g. photon detection efficiency, single photon time resolution, SiPM signal response, gain fluctuation, dark count rate, afterpulse, prompt and delayed optical crosstalk. These quantities of SiPMs can strongly influence the time and energy resolution, for example in PET and HEP. Having a complete overview on all of these parameters allows to draw conclusions on how best performances can be achieved for the various needs of different applications.

TOF-PET SPTR1.Introduction
The silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) (also solid-state photomultiplier, SSPM, or multi pixel photon counter, MPPC) is a solid state photode- tector made of an array of hundreds or thousands of integrated single- photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), called microcells or pixels [1–6]. All cells are independent and connected to a common readout. In analog SiPMs each cell has a quenching resistor and they are connected in parallel. Each cell is typically square with an edge length between less than 10 μm [7] and 100 μm [8].
Upon the detection of a photon the SPAD generates a large electric output signal due to internal avalanche multiplication. In a SiPM it is possible to count each fired SPAD separately: (i) in a digital fashion (dig- ital SiPM), where each SPAD is connected to its own readout electronic circuit [6,9] or (ii) by the amplitude (or charge) of the sum of the single SPAD signals like in an analog SiPM [1,2,10]. Either way, the SiPM allows to detect and count photons with good resolution and with single- photon sensitivity [1,11,12]. The internal avalanche amplification is   as well fast enough to obtain very good timing information of the arrival time of the detected photons [13–15], within several tens of picoseconds.
These properties, along with advantages like low bias voltage, compactness and robustness, makes the SiPM a good device for light detection from single photon to several thousand of photons, especially when fastest timing is a requisite. Typical applications based on low light intensity are light detection and ranging (LIDAR) [16,17], functional optical spectroscopy and fluorescence light detection in biology and physics [18–21], quantum physics [22] and quantum informatics [23], etc. Coupled to organic or inorganic scintillators the SiPM sense the scintillation light and/or Cherenkov light [24,25] with highest time precision. They are used in nuclear medical imaging [26–30], for gamma spectroscopy and for time tagging of high energetic particles [5,31– 33]. In these applications they exploit their higher granularity with respect to PMTs and their insensitivity to magnetic fields. For example, in oncological diagnostics time of flight (TOF) in positron emission tomography (PET) was resumed after the first studies in the ’80s by the commercial availability of high performance SiPMs around 2010. New applications like in the search for dark matter or double beta decay demand novel developments of the SiPM to extend its photon detection efficiency (PDE) towards the vacuum UV (VUV) or deep UV. On the other hand the already mentioned LIDAR market calls for a high PDE on the other side of the spectrum in the near infrared. Furthermore  new challenges in TOF-PET, high energy physics, time resolved X-ray detection and spectroscopy push developments of the SiPM to achieve single photon time resolutions (SPTRs) as good as 10 ps.
The SiPM is an already established photodetector having entered many fields of basic scientific research to social and medical appli- cations; however it is still a device with plenty of room for further developments. This paper will give an overview of the basics of a SiPM, in order to get a deep understanding of its working principles and main parameters. It starts with the description of the SPAD physics itself, the equivalent electrical model of SPADs and SiPMs followed by a definition of SiPM parameters and characterization methods with state-of-the-art results. An additional focus will as well be given on phenomenological simulations in applications like TOF-PET and new arising challenges in this field.
2.Structure and simulation models
2.1.Single photon avalanche diode
Single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), also called Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (Gm-APD) are solid-state single-photon sensitive photodetectors. They exploit avalanche multiplication as internal gain mechanism. The avalanche breakdown process has been studied in the ’60s and ’70s using avalanche photodiodes operated close to breakdown voltage or above [34–37]. Instead, the first avalanche photodiodes working above breakdown, in Geiger mode, have been proposed and studied in the ’80s and ’90s [38–40,13]. Nowadays, SPADs are realized in silicon, with custom or CMOS processes, with quenching and readout circuitry in-pixel, or made in different materials, like III/V materials for near-infrared range detection.
A SPAD is essentially a p–n junction, specifically designed to be biased above the breakdown voltage [13,38]. In such conditions, the electric field is so high (in the order of few 105 V/cm) that a single carrier injected or generated into the depletion layer can trigger a self-sustaining avalanche process. The current increases rapidly to a macroscopic level and the leading edge of the avalanche current pulse
marks with good time resolution the arrival time of the detected photon. The current theoretically would continue to flow until the avalanche   is quenched by lowering the bias voltage to or below the breakdown voltage, by a so called ‘‘quenching circuit’’. The bias voltage must then be restored in order to be able to detect another photon (reset phase).
The quenching circuit is a series resistor, with a relatively high resistance value: when the current in the SPAD increases, due to avalanche build-up, the voltage drop at the quenching resistor rises, thus the voltage at the SPAD consequently decreases, reaching values close to the breakdown voltage. Then the bias is restored through the same resistor, with a time constant:
𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡 = 𝑅𝑞 ⋅ (𝐶𝑆𝑃 𝐴𝐷 + 𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒)	(1)
where 𝑅𝑞  is the quenching resistor, 𝐶𝑆𝑃 𝐴𝐷  is the junction capacitance  of the SPAD, and 𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is the total capacitance at the high-impedance SPAD node, beside the SPAD one (e.g. the parasitic capacitance of connections or the capacitance given by the quenching resistor, or quenching circuit). In analog SiPMs the capacitance at the node is mostly the one given by the integrated quenching resistor, which is placed on     the top of the cell junction, 𝐶𝑞 in parallel to 𝑅𝑞 .
Fig. 1 shows an example of the structure of a p-on-n silicon SPAD, the reverse current vs bias curve with avalanche quenching and reset phase, the typical single-SPAD readout circuitry and the combination of SPADs to form an analog SiPM.
For single SPADs (i.e. SPADs with external not-integrated quenching circuit) or typically for CMOS SPADs, the passive quenching has been generally replaced by active quenching or mixed-active–passive quench- ing solutions [13], where a transistor is used to force the bias to either quench or reset the SPAD. With such active solutions, the recharge is faster and the dead-time (i.e. the time when the SPAD is not sensitive) can be set and is well defined (no more exponential recharge where SPADs gradually become more and more sensitive [13]).
Generally speaking, the closer the quenching circuit is to the SPAD, the smaller is the amount of charge flowing per avalanche, since the detection of the avalanche triggering happens earlier and the parasitic capacitance 𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is reduced. In a CMOS ‘‘active pixel’’ the quenching circuit is realized in each pixel which can be very compact with the pixel

(a) Example of p-on-n silicon SPAD structure, (b) reverse current vs bias curve, with avalanche, quenching and reset phase, (c) typical single-SPAD readout circuit, with discriminator to digitize the signal, (d) example of analog output and digitized signal, and (e) typical analog SiPM circuit, composed by many SPADs with integrated quenching resistors (𝑅𝑞 ), and with sensing resistor (𝑅𝑠).
pitch in the order of few tens of micrometers. Nevertheless, the active quenching circuit is area-consuming and this is particularly relevant for example when building an imager, or when the SPADs are integrated in a 2D array, creating a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). In such cases, the fill-factor (FF) of the pixel is very important. It has to be as high  as possible to increase the photon detection efficiency (which includes the geometrical FF). In these cases, passive quenching is preferable: the resistor is very compact and for example, in analog SiPMs it can be realized at the side of the SPADs active area, without any significant FF reduction [17].
2.2.Avalanche process
In a diode the reverse current–voltage curve generally shows a divergence at a certain bias voltage. This is called  the  breakdown  voltage (𝑉𝑏𝑑 ): it is defined as the voltage where the multiplication factor
(M) [41], i.e. the number of secondary carriers produced per each primary one diverges. The breakdown voltage is the edge between the linear multiplication (typical of APDs) and the diverging ‘‘avalanche’’ breakdown (typical of SPADs), where the photodetector works in Geiger mode. The breakdown voltage can be easily identified in externally quenched single SPADs, where the reverse current–voltage curve starts to rise very steeply. However, in recent SiPM cells, i.e. SPADs with integrated quenching resistor, the so called ‘‘gain’’ (the amount of charge
flowing per avalanche) is made small, in the order of 105  electrons
(compared to 107–108 in externally-quenched SPADs) [13]. This makes the current rise not as accentuated as in the externally quenched SPADs, thus the breakdown voltage identification can be less straightforward. Moreover, sometimes it can happen that an intense leakage current (see Fig. 1b), combined with a small bulk generation of the SPAD(s) prevent the correct identification of the breakdown voltage from the current–voltage curve. The bulk generation is the multiplied current or avalanche pulses from the depleted region, whereas the leakage current is due to current flowing at the periphery of the device (e.g. at the surface) and not multiplied.
The value of the breakdown voltage depends on the internal struc- ture of the diode (particularly the doping profiles at the p–n junction)and on the temperature. The ‘‘ionization integral’’ is defined as in Eq. (2) and conventionally at the breakdown voltage it is considered equal to one [42].@2
Here 𝛼𝑛 and 𝛼𝑝 are the ionization coefficient of electrons and holes respectively and 𝑊 is the depleted region width. Different authors report different models and different ionization coefficient values (see for example the comparison in [42]). It can be divided among local models and non-local models, taking into account the history of the particle. Van Overstraeten–de Man [43] and Okuto–Crowell [44] are among the most used models in device simulators [45]. Generally, ionization coefficients show an exponential dependency on the electric field. The dependence on temperature, instead, can be qualitatively understood thinking about the physics of the avalanche multiplication: every carrier entering the high-field region is accelerated by the electric field and has a certain probability to hit another atom of the reticle      or a phonon while traveling the depleted region. In case of a collision with an atom, there is a minimum energy, called threshold energy to produce a second electron–hole pair (impact ionization), which as a first  approximation  is  𝐸𝑡ℎ   =   3∕2𝐸𝑔  [46]  (when  the  effective  masses of electron and holes are assumed equal). Every time the accelerated carrier with energy below impact ionization hits an atom or a phonon  it looses energy without generating secondary carriers. The higher the temperature, the higher is the rate of collisions and, hence, the smaller is the average energy of the accelerated carriers. Thus, the critical electric field needed to generate a self-sustained avalanche process increases with the temperature and therefore the breakdown-voltage increases as well.
In addition, the width of the depleted region affects significantly the breakdown voltage. Supposing (as a first approximation) that the electric field is constant inside the depleted region, then in a wider depleted region there will be a higher number of possible collisions, thus a higher probability of impact generation. Therefore, a wider high- field region has a lower critical electric field (at breakdown), which    is generally preferable to reduce the field-enhanced noise generation. However, despite the lower peak field, the breakdown voltage is higher, since the depleted region is wider. Indeed, the breakdown voltage is the integral of electric field over the whole width. This has to be considered also to understand the temperature dependence. The critical electric field (at breakdown) increases with temperature. With a wider depleted region, the increment in critical electric field will be multiplied for a higher value, thus giving a larger variation with temperature. Vice- versa, with a narrower depleted region, the temperature dependence will be smaller.
Note that the depleted region width considered here (for breakdown voltage variation) is just the one at the breakdown voltage: the depleted region width generally varies in the device with the applied bias.
What was discussed so far is related mostly to avalanche build-up and breakdown voltage. Avalanche quenching, as described above, is made with simple or more complicated avalanche circuits. Considering a simple passive-quenching, after ignition  and  avalanche  build-up  the  current  discharges  the  capacitance  at  the  high-impedance  node
𝐶𝑆𝑃 𝐴𝐷 + 𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 and the voltage across the junction falls towards the asymptotic  value  𝑉𝑓   given  by:  𝑉𝑏𝑑  +  𝑅𝑑 𝐼𝑓 ,  where  𝐼𝑓   =   𝑉𝑜𝑣∕𝑅𝑞  is the steady state current and 𝑅𝑑 the internal SPAD resistance. The avalanche multiplication process is stochastic and when 𝐼𝑓 is small enough and 𝑉𝑓 very close to the breakdown voltage, the amount of multiplied carriers is reduced and it can happen that instantaneously the avalanche process is no more self-sustaining. This leads to a progressive reduction of the avalanche current, thus the avalanche is quenched.  The threshold current value for avalanche quenching is not well defined and probably it depends on the internal structure, the high-field region depth, the peak electric field and the overall active area extension.      In  literature  it  is  reported  that  the  avalanche  seems  to  extend  to a
diameter of about 10 μm before quenching [47], for different active area dimensions. As a rule of thumb it is considered that 20 μA is a correct value for the steady-state current for a  prompt  passive-quenching [13].
2.2.1.Electric field uniformity
So far we discussed about a one-dimensional analysis of the break- down. As a better approximation, the p–n junction has to be analyzed at least in two dimensions, to account for the ‘‘edge effects’’. In the center of the p–n junction the previous one-dimensional analysis is valid, whereas at the edges there can be edge premature breakdown issues or a non-uniform electric field going from the center to the edges of the p–n junction. In the former case, the curvature effect of the p–n junction creates a higher electric field at the edges, thus a higher multiplication factor and a smaller ‘‘local’’ breakdown voltage at the edges. At the breakdown voltage, identified by the reverse I–V curve, only a small portion of the diode area is actually working in Geiger mode, whereas the central part is not. Different ‘‘local breakdown voltages’’ can be estimated on the different carrier paths [48].
To avoid edge breakdown, typically a guard-ring or a virtual guard- ring structure is used. Examples of this implementations in custom processes or CMOS processes can be found in [49,50]. Fig. 2(a) shows an example of a guard-ring (GR) in a CMOS-compatible SPAD, created with p+ implant and n-well, using p-well for GR, whereas Fig. 2(b) shows a typical custom-process SPAD, using a p-enriched implant to create a ‘‘virtual guard ring’’ (i.e. higher depletion at the edges). The electric field at the edges is effectively reduced, avoiding edge breakdown, but as a secondary effect this slightly reduces the effective active area. This is due to the transition region between the central high-field area to the edge, where the electric field ‘‘gradually’’ reduces. Moreover, carriers in the border region are not drifted vertically, as in the central region, but laterally towards a lower-field region. As a result the effective active
area is smaller than the nominal (layout) one. This transition region can be in the order of 1–2 μm, thus negligible in big area SPADs (e.g. 50 μm), but important in small SPADs.
2.2.2.Photon detection efficiency
Photon detection efficiency (PDE) quantifies the ability of a single-photon detector to detect photons. This is the ratio between the number is calculated as in Eq. (3).
@3
Here QE is the quantum efficiency, 𝑃 the avalanche triggering prob-ability, 𝑉𝑂𝑉 is the overvoltage and 𝐹 𝐹𝑒𝑓 𝑓 is the effective geometrical fill-factor. The geometric fill factor is typically not included in the PDE calculation when characterizing a single SPAD (in this case normally thephoton detection probability PDP is quoted), but it has to be considered when it is part of an array or of a SiPM.
The quantum efficiency includes the probability of a photon to enter into the detector (i.e. without being reflected at the surface) and then  to be absorbed in the ‘‘useful’’ part of the device, i.e. where the photo- generated carriers have some chance to reach the active region before being re-absorbed. The avalanche triggering probability depends on  the electric field, thus on the overvoltage and on the position where  the carriers are generated. In particular, it is significantly different for photo-generated electrons or holes, since the ionization coefficient for electrons is typically higher than the one for holes [37].
The PDE of a SPAD or SiPM based on a p-on-n junction is quite different from the one of an n-on-p junction [51]. Referring to a structure like the one in Fig. 2(b), we can consider two cases: (1) a p-type shallow implant with n-type enrichment (n-type epi/substrate) and (2) an n- type shallow with p-type enrichment (p-type epi/substrate). Supposing a junction depth of few hundreds of nanometers, the majority of photons in the green and red part of the spectrum are absorbed in depth, beneath the junction, whereas the photons in the blue part are absorbed close to the surface, above the junction. Only electrons in p-on-n junction type and only holes in n-on-p junction type, will trigger the avalanche process when photons are absorbed close to the surface [52,53]. The photo-generation happens always above the junction, thus only one type of carrier is drifted towards the high-field region and can trigger the avalanche. Instead, for green and red photons, light is absorbed above or below the junction (the high field region). Photo-generated electrons or holes can trigger the avalanche (not just one of them), from above  or below the junction. For red and NIR photons mostly holes (in p- on-n junction) or mostly electrons (n-on-p junction) are generated and trigger the avalanche (assuming the collection region below the junction is bigger than above the junction). Even considering a fixed depleted region width and the same device structure for the two junction type cases (thus the same QE), the different type of carriers triggering the avalanche give a different spectral shape of the PDE [51–53].
Finally, the effective FF depends specifically on the layout and on the internal SPAD structure, in particular on the uniformity of electric fields and on the border effect. As described in the previous section,   at the border the electric field is lower and there are also depletion effects which make the photo-generated carriers in those regions to drift laterally instead of vertically, thus not triggering any avalanche (see Fig. 2(c)) [7,15]. This border effect can be very important in  small SPADs (i.e. microcells in SiPMs). It reduces when increasing the overvoltage, due to saturation of the avalanche triggering probability with a higher electric field. Moreover, the border region created by the border effect is different depending on the depth in the SPAD [52], thus the FF can be also considered partially dependent on the wavelength.
The PDE can be simulated in different ways, for example with the TCAD simulation software [45]. Here, instead, we report just a simple example of QE and PDE estimation based on effective values of FF and the collection depths. Fig. 3(left) shows the estimated internal quantum efficiency (𝑄𝐸) for different effective absorption region thicknesses (i.e. ‘‘effective’’ epitaxial layer thickness), whereas Fig. 3(right) shows the estimated PDE, for two different absorption  region thicknesses and for n-on-p or p-on-n structures. This estimation has been done considering as a first approximation the absorption region divided in two, where electrons or holes are the dominant carriers triggering the
avalanche, see Eq. (4).
@4
𝑄𝐸 is the internal quantum efficiency, 𝑄𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑝 is the quantum ef- ficiency considering the absorption only in the upper region of the junction, 𝑥𝑑 is the junction depth (in this particular example ∼500 nm),
𝑥1 is the top region thickness where carriers recombine before reaching  the depleted region (in this particular example 5 nm), 𝑇𝑎𝑏𝑠 is the absorption region thickness, 𝑇𝐴𝑅𝐶 is the transmission of anti-reflective coating (calculated for each wavelength) and 𝑙  is the absorption length.
𝑃𝑡,𝑒 = 0.86 and 𝑃𝑡,ℎ = 0.39  are the triggering probability for electrons and holes, calculated at 4 V overvoltage using the plots and fitting parameters reported in [52]. 𝐹 𝐹 in this case is 0.72. The reported  formula is valid for p-on-n junction types. For n-on-p type 𝑃𝑡,𝑒 and 𝑃𝑡,ℎ have to be exchanged.
2.2.3.Gain and amplitude
The gain of the single cell represents the number of carriers flowing per each triggered avalanche. In analog SiPMs it is generally ‘‘well defined’’ due to the integrated resistor, the internal capacitances and the good uniformity obtained in the fabrications processes. This is in contrast for example with single SPADs with external quenching circuit,Fig. 2. TCAD simulation of electric field inside SPADs. The structures are examples of a CMOS SPAD with guard ring made with p-well (a), of a custom process SPAD with p-type enrichment implant (b) and a detail of the carrier path in this second structure at the border (c). Arrows represent the local current direction. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

where bonding wires, connections and different front-end readout canchange  significantly  the  value  of  𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒,  thus  the  amount  of  charge flowing per avalanche.number resolving capabilities, which can be estimated by the amplitude spectrum or by the charge spectrum, when the signal is integrated overa certain time synchronous with the light pulses [11,12]. For an analog SiPM cell, as in Fig. 1(e), the average gain is generally expressed, as in Eq. (5).@5
With 𝑞 denoting the elementary charge 𝑞 = 1.602 ⋅ 10−19 C. The gain is typically in the order of 105 to 107 [54,11] and produces a single photon signal well above the electronic noise level. Hence, constraints on the readout electronics are not as severe as in the case of APDs or PIN photodiodes. The excess noise factor component due to the variation of the gain, defined as    , or	is defined as 1 +   2 ∕  2  , where    is
the standard deviation of the gain fluctuation, is a𝐺lmost unity (𝐹  ≈  1).
In SiPMs, instead, other components are more important and dominate in defining the excess noise factor, in particular: the correlated noise (afterpulsing and optical crosstalk) and saturation effects. The mean charge at the output is therefore not just proportional to the input number of detected photons (plus noise) multiplied by the average gain of the SiPM cells, but due to correlated noise the mean and the variance are larger. This enlargement can be quantified by the excess charge
@6
@7
The internal capacitances, 𝐶𝑑 and 𝐶𝑞 depend on the SPAD dimen- sions (and layout). A smaller cell gives a smaller gain, thus a smaller number of carriers flowing during the avalanche. This could give a worse photon number resolution (since the peaks in the charge spectrum are less separated), but it reduces the correlated noise (as described inthe next sections) and it makes the recharge of the single cell faster.The former aspect gives a better peak-to-valley ratio [11], whereas the second aspect makes it possible to integrate for a smaller time window, integrating less dark noise.
Examples of gain (average) and signal amplitude of SiPMs (NUV-HD from FBK) with 40 μm and 25 μm cell pitch are shown in Fig. 4. As in the reported example, in some devices the gain dependence on overvoltage is not linear. This is due to the progressive depletion of the epi-layer beneath the p–n junction, leading to a diode capacitance reduction with increasing bias voltage, thus a non linear gain dependence. Evidence  of this can be seen in previous works [11]. TCAD simulations of the exact cell structure (not shown here) confirm that the depletion of the epi-layer is gradually increasing with the overvoltage of the SiPM.
The amplitude of the signal instead, might be not entirely related to the gain. It is true that bigger cells (i.e. SPADs) have typically higher gain and larger signal amplitude, but the single-cell signal is usually composed by a fast component and a slow component [10,55]. The fast
component is due to the capacitive coupling of the avalanche signal through the quenching capacitance (𝐶𝑞 ) and then partitioned towards the output (due to the other capacitances and parasitics), whereas the slow component is due to the recharge current flowing through the quenching resistor (𝑅𝑞 ), being higher at the beginning and then expo- nentially decreasing (exponential recharge). The front-end electronics has a significant role in signal shaping, depending on its bandwidth the fast component can be prompt and very high in amplitude or can be filtered out completely. Fig. 4(b) shows an example of measured peak amplitude of SiPMs with 40 μm and 25 μm cell pitch. In Fig. 5 the corresponding signal shape can be seen. In this measurement the SiPM was amplified by a front-end based on the AD8000 operational amplifier chip, in a trans-impedance configuration, with a second amplification stage. Total trans-impedance gain is 5000 V/A, considering the 50 Ω termination of the oscilloscope input. It can be qualitatively inferred that the fast component has a frequency content in the range of 50– 250 MHz. Similar low-pass filtering effects can also be given by the total capacitance of the SiPM itself (i.e. sum of grid capacitance and the overall capacitance of all not triggered cells) and by further parasitics of the package. A big SiPM, e.g. 6 × 6 mm2 or 10 × 10 mm2, has a large capacitance. Without a very small input impedance of the front-end an output-current low-pass filtering effect can be observed, smoothing the fast component similar to a reduced front-end bandwidth [14].
Fig. 6 shows an example of charge spectrum and amplitude spectrum, acquired with a 1 × 1 mm2 SiPM with 40 μm pitch. In this example we used a pulsed LED illumination, with narrow pulses and the acquisition was synchronous with the light. The amplitude spectrum acquired with lower bandwidth shows a better peak-to-valley ratio. Indeed, amplitude
spectra are generally significantly affected by the electronic noise of the front-end and by peak amplitude oscillations. Both are generally reduced when the signal is low-pass filtered. The charge spectrum instead is  not affected by the bandwidth (as a first approximation) but is more affected by the length of the integration window and by dark count rate and correlated noise probability. Indeed, due to delayed correlated noise there can be subsequent pulses (after the primary one), with time delays between few to hundreds of nanoseconds. Afterpulsing generates pulses with ‘‘fractional’’ charge (smaller than the single photo-electron charge), whereas delayed crosstalk and primary noise could generate pulses at the edge of integration window, thus being partially integrated. Both effects increase the ‘‘valley amplitude’’ in the charge spectrum, thus worsening the peak-to-valley ratio. There is typically an ‘‘optimum’’ integration time, reducing the amount of fractional-charge events but preserving the useful information about primary pulses.
2.3.SPAD equivalent electrical model
The analog SPAD with integrated quenching resistor is usually mod- eled as a parallel connection between the internal resistance of the diode space-charge region 𝑅𝑑 and the inner depletion layer capacitance 𝐶𝑑 , which itself can be the sum of the SPAD area capacitance and any kind of perimeter capacitance (see Fig. 7). When the SPAD has the quenching resistor integrated, i.e. like in analog SiPM cells, the model includes also the quenching part [10]. This is described by the quenching resistor 𝑅𝑞 and a ‘‘parasitic’’ (or designed) capacitance 𝐶𝑞 in parallel, which can be beneficial to increase fast signal extraction [14,56]. A detected photon (or noise event) triggering the avalanche in the SPAD is modeled by closing a switch in Fig. 7 [13,57]. A current starts to discharge the  internal node with total capacitance equal to the sum of 𝐶𝑞 and 𝐶𝑑 through 𝑅𝑑 [57,58]. The voltage drop at the internal node is almost equal to the overvoltage, i.e. the difference between cathode–anode reverse bias and the breakdown voltage, modeled as the DC power supply 𝑉𝑏𝑑 . Indeed, as reported in Eq. (5), the avalanche charge is expressed as the overvoltage times the sum of the two capacitances.
In literature, for the SiPM equivalent electrical models, the avalanche is sometimes modeled via a pulsed current source [10,59] in place of the series of the switch, the breakdown DC power supply and 𝑅𝑑 [58]. These

two approaches are to a certain extend equivalent, especially when the user is only interested in simulating the output signal from the SiPM. However, the approach with the switch and the DC 𝑉𝑏𝑑 source can simulate, if needed, the avalanche quenching or non-quenching.
Before photon detection (switch open) 𝐶𝑑  is charged to the SiPM   bias voltage 𝑉𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 applied on the anode and cathode with the positive voltage on the cathode. Upon photon detection (or in general avalanche triggering by photon or dark counts), the switch in Fig. 7 is  closed, leading to a discharge of the capacitance 𝐶𝑑 via the resistor 𝑅𝑑 . The initially high current 𝐼𝑑  (in the range of several milliamperes) is given   by the overvoltage 𝑉𝑂𝑉 divided by 𝑅𝑑 [13]. 𝑉𝑂𝑉 is the difference of the applied bias voltage 𝑉𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 and the breakdown voltage 𝑉𝑏𝑑 . The voltage

drop on 𝐶𝑑 provokes a similar voltage change on 𝐶𝑞 producing  an external current spike giving rise to a fast initial signal part in the front- end electronics. The intrinsic limit  of  the  signal  rise  time  (i.e.  when not limited by the amplifier or front-end bandwidth  or  slew-rate)  is  given by 𝜏𝑟 = (𝐶𝑑 + 𝐶𝑞 ) ⋅ (𝑅𝑑  ∥  𝑅𝑞 )  [10] and can be in the range of  tens of picoseconds only. The discharge of 𝐶𝑑 and recharge of 𝐶𝑞 isstopped when the current 𝐼𝑑 through 𝑅𝑑 reaches a certain value, i.e. the‘‘threshold current’’, which is the minimum value of current to get a self sustainable avalanche process. This value is a bit higher then the
asymptotic minimum value 𝐼𝑑𝑓 that 𝐼𝑑 would reach. This asymptoticthe cell recovery or recharge time is given by 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 = 𝑅𝑞 ⋅ (𝐶𝑞 + 𝐶𝑑 ). Hence, as described in the previous chapter, in the passively quenched

SPAD a fast signal component followed by a slow component can be observed.
The model described here assumes that the avalanche stops when the voltage across the junction reaches 𝑉𝑏𝑑 , where the avalanche can no more self-sustain. This naturally gives the correct gain of the SPAD
with  the  integrated  quenching  circuit  defined  as  𝑉𝑂𝑉  ⋅ (𝐶𝑞  +  𝐶𝑑 )∕𝑞.
Recently it was reported in [60] that a voltage at which the avalanche stops (i.e. extrapolated from linear fit on the gain plot) is ∼1 V lower than 𝑉𝑏𝑑 for a SiPM with 15 μm pitch (following the model in [61]). However, there is no general agreement on this point and the majority of measurements in literature are compatible with the assumption that the avalanche stops at 𝑉𝑏𝑑 .
2.4.SiPM equivalent electrical model
The most common representation of the SiPM equivalent electrical circuit can be seen in Fig. 8. The differences to the SPAD equivalent circuit are the additional passive components of the other not-triggered SPADs plus the grid inductances and capacitances  [10,57,58].  The  output current produced by the triggered cell(s), especially the fast component via 𝐶𝑞 is divided by the parasitic capacitance 𝐶𝑔 (i.e. mainly the capacitance of the metal grid and bonding pads) and the series connection of the passive capacitances (𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡 − 𝑛𝑓 ) ⋅ 𝐶𝑞 and (𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡 − 𝑛𝑓 ) ⋅ 𝐶𝑑 of  the  𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡  − 𝑛𝑓  inactive  cells  of  the  SiPM  [55].  In  the  schematic  𝑛𝑓 represents the number of triggered cells of a total of 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡 cells available in the SiPM, thus 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡 − 𝑛𝑓  is the number of not triggered cells. Hence, depending on the input impedance  of  the  used  front-end  electronics,  the grid capacitance and the inactive cells can cause a noticeable drop      in the single SPAD signal amplitude. Using an amplifier with very low input impedance, e.g. few Ohms (like transimpedance amplifier) the impedance of the passive and parasitic part is generally higher than the input impedance of the amplifier and this helps in extracting the current signal [62]. The parasitic trace (and bonding) inductance 𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑟 and resistance 𝑅𝑝𝑎𝑟 limit the SiPM signal rise time and should be minimized in a proper printed circuit board (PCB) design in order to benefit from   the intrinsically fast rise time of the SiPM signal for fastest timing.
In the frequency domain the absolute impedance of the SiPM can be obtained as in Eq. (8). This function can serve to estimate the SiPM’s
equivalent circuit component values by measuring 𝑍 in the frequency
range and fitting to the model [63].
@8
𝑌𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 (also called 𝑌𝑝𝑖𝑥) is the admittance of the single cell, which is then multiplied by the total number of pixels in the |𝑍(𝜔)| calculation, since
they are all supposed inactive. For low to intermediate frequencies 𝑌
is dominated by 𝐶 . The capacitive component of 𝑍  is ∼  𝑁  ⋅ 𝐶  . At high frequencies instead the contribution of 𝐶𝑞 dominates over the 𝑅𝑞
one, thus the capacitive component of |𝑍| is ∼ 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡
𝐶𝑑 ⋅𝐶𝑞
𝐶𝑑 +𝐶𝑞
Because of epitaxial layer depletion, the impedance will depend on   the absolute bias of the measurement. The smaller depletion of low bias will give a higher 𝐶𝑑 , whereas a progressively higher depletion reaching the breakdown voltage will lower the value of 𝐶𝑑 . In case the change     of depletion region thickness is  relevant  above  breakdown,  there  will be a dependence of the measured impedance on the overvoltage, even though direct impedance measurement above breakdown is generally difficult. Moreover, a change in the equivalent circuit as a function of    the number of pixels firing can be seen, leading to a slight change in the output signal (due to different load and charge partitioning).
Neglecting the parasitic part in Eq. (8) the complex impedance 𝑍(𝜔), or the complex admittance 𝑌 (𝜔), can be rewritten as in Eq. (10) [58], further assuming that no cells in the SiPM are firing.@10As already mentioned the sum 𝐶𝑑 +𝐶𝑞 can be measured via the gain of the SiPM, 𝐺𝑎𝑖𝑛 = (𝑉𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 −𝑉𝑏𝑑 )(𝐶𝑑 +𝐶𝑞 )∕𝑞 and the quench resistor value 𝑅𝑞 can be obtained from the forward current measurements, knowing the number of cells in the SiPM 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡. This defines all parameters of the SiPM equivalent model except the diode series resistance 𝑅𝑑 , which in theory could be estimated by the single SPAD signal rise time. However, other effects as bandwidth limitations of the used electronics and parasitic inductances makes the direct measurement of 𝑅𝑑 via the signal rise time not reliable. In most of the cases, however, 𝑅𝑑 can be assumed to be small in the range of ∼1 kΩ and simulations show that changing 𝑅𝑑 in a broad range does not impact the model output too much [58].
2.5.Noise and secondary effects in SiPMs
The noise in the SPADs and in the SiPMs can be divided in:
1.Primary noise: this identifies the avalanche pulse triggered by thermally generated carriers (possibly field-enhanced thermal generation [64]) or carriers generated due to tunneling in the high-field region [50]. Tunneling generation is important at low temperatures [65].
2.Correlated noise: this identifies all the avalanche pulses subse- quent to a primary event, which are generated because of the primary ones, thus ‘‘correlated’’ to this one. These pulses are generated due to: (i) afterpulsing (in the same cell) or (ii) optical crosstalk (in neighboring microcells of the SPAD-array or SiPM).
Primary noise at room temperature is generally dominated by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) generation–recombination. The generation rate depends typically on the ‘‘quality’’ of the epi layer, in terms of number of deep levels and activation energy. The higher the defect concentration is the lower will the equivalent ‘‘lifetime’’ (𝜏𝑆𝑅𝐻 ) be, thus the higher is the rate of avalanche pulse generation in dark conditions, called dark count rate (DCR). It also depends on the volume of the Fig. 9. Example of measured DCR of a SiPM per unit area (1 × 1 mm2 ), as a function of overvoltage at different temperatures.
depleted region, thus on the micro-cell fill-factor and on the depleted re-gion thickness. NIR sensitive SiPMs, having a thicker epitaxial layer and
hicker depleted region [66] have a higher DCR (if all other parametersare the same). SRH generation is also affected by the high electric field which is present in the avalanche region. This induces effects like Pole– Frenkel and thermal-enhanced trap-assisted-tunneling [64,67]: all these effects can be modeled by lowering the effective generation lifetime of the SRH process, due to the electric fields.
At higher temperatures, or in some devices already at room tempera-
ture, the diffusion current from neutral regions around the depleted one
can be significant, too.
Decreasing the temperature the DCR significantly decreases. As in
the example shown in Fig. 9 the DCR halves every 10 degrees. However, at even lower temperatures tunneling generation becomes dominant and the dependence on temperature reduces. This is particularly important for cryogenic temperatures based applications [65]. The ‘‘corner tem- perature’’ (between tunneling and thermal generations) depend on the microcell design, in particular on the electric field at breakdown voltage. The higher it is the higher is the tunneling generation contribution. Indeed, recent developments apply low-fields to reduce the DCR at low temperatures [65].
2.5.1.Afterpulsing
Afterpulsing is a correlated noise component of SPADs and SiPMs that is due to trapping and subsequent release of carriers in the high- field region. Deep levels up to shallow levels in the bandgap of the avalanche region can act as traps for the large amount of carriers flowing during the avalanche. Some of the carriers can be trapped and then released subsequently (typically exponential distribution of the release times) generating a secondary spurious avalanche. The afterpulsing probability depends on the number of the effective traps in the high-field region and on their release time constant compared to the recharge time constant of the microcells (or the hold-off time in an actively quenched SPAD). Indeed, to mitigate the afterpulsing probability, the recharge time constant (or hold-off) can be regulated to have the majority of traps released when the cell is not yet completely recharged.
Afterpulsing can also be ‘‘optically-induced’’, thus not related to traps in the high field region. During each avalanche, secondary photons   are produced [68,69] and some of them can be re-absorbed in the   same microcell in the neutral region beneath the active region. This can photo-generate carriers that can reach via diffusion the depleted region, where they can trigger a secondary spurious avalanche, as shown in Fig. 10. For optically induced afterpulsing the correspondent of the trap release time constant is the carrier lifetime in the neutral region.  In the substrate this can be between few nanoseconds to hundreds       of nanoseconds [69]. To reduce optically-induced afterpulsing, a low- lifetime substrate has to be used [69]. When the lifetime is much smaller
Fig. 10. Typical SiPM crosssection with the different type of correlated noise represented: direct (or prompt) crosstalk (DiCT), delayed crosstalk (DeCT), afterpulsing optically induced (or diffused) (APdiff) and external crosstalk due to reflection on the top protective layer of the SiPM (this can as well generate either direct or delayed crosstalk events). Afterpulsing due to trapping in the high-field region in not represented.

than the recharge  time  constant  of  the  microcell,  this  contribution is negligible. Another possible solution is to use an inverted-doping substrate, creating a second p–n junction, blocking all carriers photo- generated in the substrate to diffuse towards the avalanche region [50].
2.5.2.Prompt and delayed cross-talk
As described above, secondary photons are produced during the avalanche. The amount has been estimated to 3 ⋅ 10−5 photons per avalanche carrier [70,71]. This photon emission is isotropic and gives rise to absorption and photon generated carriers in neighboring SPADs, as shown in Fig. 10 (i.e. neighboring cells in the SiPM). This phenomena is the cause of optical crosstalk. When a photon is detected in one cell, the avalanche pulse in this cell can trigger (with a certain probability) avalanches in the neighboring cells, thus for example creating pulses with two times or three times the single-cell amplitude in a SiPM, even though the ‘‘primary’’ photon was only one. This type of optical crosstalk is as well called ‘‘direct’’ optical crosstalk, or ‘‘prompt’’ optical crosstalk. The output signal of the SiPM is twice as high in amplitude as can be seen in Fig. 11.
Another type of optical crosstalk can be seen on the very right        in Fig. 11, the ‘‘delayed’’ optical crosstalk. It is caused by secondary photons generating an electron–hole pair in the bulk, or generally in the neutral regions near the depleted one (see Fig. 10). The charge carriers will diffuse and some of them can reach the active region and trigger an avalanche with a delay of several nanoseconds to microseconds. It has to be considered that due to the finite bandwidth and sampling rate of the front-end and SiPM signal acquisition, it is possible that part of the delayed crosstalk events are interpreted as prompt crosstalk. For example, if the analysis method can distinguish events down to 2 ns every delayed crosstalk happening with smaller diffusion time will be considered as a prompt crosstalk.
In Fig. 12 the frequency of dark count events and crosstalk events is shown. Measurements were performed by triggering on random dark count events by setting the trigger threshold well below the single SPAD signal amplitude and recording  the  corresponding  charge  spectrum of the resulting pulse. Hence, the crosstalk events seen in the plot

are induced by dark count events. In this example, for a Hamamatsu S10931 SiPM with 50 μm  SPAD pitch, the probability of triggering  N avalanches simultaneously via optical crosstalk can be described decreasing exponentially with N. Often such a simple model of the crosstalk probability is sufficient and can be used to phenomenologically include crosstalk in Monte Carlo simulations. However, there are more complex models for the optical crosstalk probabilities. Comprehensive descriptions of optical crosstalk with a description of the generalized Poisson distribution which has been shown to be a powerful tool to characterize crosstalk upon light detection can be found in [72–74]. Optical crosstalk can be mitigated by inserting optical trenches between the microcells in the SiPM [75,76,54].
3.Experimental  methods  and results
3.1.Signal pick-up and front-end  electronics
Depending on the gain (or amount of charge per avalanche) of      the SPADs or SiPM cells, the output current signal can be more or   less pronounced, possibly requiring amplification. Analog SiPM signals are generally amplified in a transimpedance configuration, having a gain of 1000–10000 V/A. This gives an amplified output signal in the order of few tens of millivolts in response to a single photon. For some applications the required amplification can be smaller (about one order of magnitude lower) when it is not important to have single-photon sensitivity, for example when using the SiPM to read-out the signal from scintillators (i.e. many photons per each event).
Front-end amplifiers for analog SiPMs are generally based on tran- simpedance amplifiers, like for example represented in Fig. 13. The input impedance should be low to reduce the filtering effect of the   grid capacitance and of parasitic components. Alternatively, a series shunt resistor to the SiPM can be used, followed by a voltage amplifier. This approach is generally not preferred since the series resistance sets compromises between amplification and bandwidth (i.e. steepness of the signal), as discussed in [62], however, it can be beneficial when used with RF amplifiers, with adapted input impedance and very high bandwidths. Recent work shows very good signal steepness with analog SiPM using baluns (transformer) to reduce the input impedance at the SiPM, followed by AC coupled high-bandwidth RF amplifiers, inspired by the patent in [77].
The signal coming from the SiPM is the superposition of many pulses. Depending on the application it is possible to measure the current or to count the avalanche pulses (photon-counting mode). When the count rate is low, the pulses are well separated but increasing the count rate they start to overlap, preventing correct photon counting. To reduce this problem some techniques can be employed:
Fig. 13. Example of front-end circuit for SiPM amplification. First stage is based on a transimpedance configuration and the gain is given by 𝑅𝑓 (expressed in volt over ampere). The second stage can further amplify and shape the signal.
1.High-pass filtering;
2.Pole-zero cancellation [78];
3.DLED (delayed leading-edge discrimination) [79];
4.Modification of the device to enhance or to extract only the fast signal component, thus minimizing or avoiding the slow recharge tail [80].
The first three methods modify the signal, ‘‘hiding’’ the slow recharge tail, thus making pulses more narrow and allowing photon counting up to higher frequencies. A simple high-pass filtering can leave some un- dershoot after the main peak, whereas pole-zero compensation, despite the need to be tuned on the specific signal, can avoid this problem.
There are other applications not based on single-photon sensitivity where SiPMs are used to read-out the signal from a scintillator (many photons per event), the readout of scintillating fibers or Cerenkov radiators, etc. The pile-up of pulses if manifesting in severe baseline shifts can be a problem in these applications, especially when doing timing measurements. The previously reported techniques can as well be applied in these applications.
3.2.Current–voltage characteristics
The current–voltage (I–V) curve of SPADs and SiPMs is an important measurement. It is used typically to get a quick overview of the functionality of the device and to estimate its breakdown voltage. Both forward bias and reverse bias curve are important in analog SiPMs.
The reverse-bias I–V curve shows the leakage current at bias lower than the breakdown voltage, whereas at higher biases the current suddenly increases. The leakage current can be almost flat or increasing with the bias, as shown in Fig. 14(a). The current 𝐼𝐺𝑀 after the breakdown voltage is proportional to the rate of dark counts (DCR) and to the gain of the cell (i.e. charge per each avalanche):
𝐼𝐺𝑀 = 𝐷𝐶𝑅(𝑉𝑜𝑣) ⋅ 𝐺𝐴𝐼𝑁(𝑉𝑜𝑣) ⋅ 𝑞 ⋅ 𝐸𝐶𝐹 (𝑉𝑜𝑣)	(13)
𝐷𝐶𝑅(𝑉𝑜𝑣) ∝ 𝐺𝑒𝑛_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒(𝑇 𝑒𝑚𝑝, 𝑉𝑜𝑣) ⋅ 𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔 (𝑉𝑜𝑣)
where 𝑞 is the elementary charge and 𝐸𝐶𝐹 is the excess charge factor, which quantifies the average extra charge produced per each avalanche due  to  correlated  noise.  𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔  is  the  avalanche  triggering probability,
which can be expressed in its simpler form as 1 − exp(− 𝑉𝑂𝑉  ), where
The measurement of the reverse I–V  curve  requires  typically  a source and measurement unit (SMU) with several order of magnitude in dynamic range. It is important to measure from the leakage current level (typically between hundreds of picoampere to tens of nanoampere) up     to the multiplied current (between hundreds of nanoampere to hundreds  of microampere). In single SPADs or small SiPMs the leakage current can be one order of magnitude lower. The measurement of forward current instead can be sensitive to the series resistance of the package or to any series resistance in the setup. These can lower the measured current and prevent a correct estimation of the quenching resistors 𝑅𝑞 of the SPADs. This issue is typically negligible in small-area SiPMs or with a small number of cells in parallel.
3.3.Time domain: SiPM signal
As described in previous sections, the current signal from the SiPM has to be properly amplified and shaped (if needed by the application). The signal is generally composed by a fast and a slow component, having a different frequency content.
In order to have a good time resolution it is important to preserve the steep rising edge of the signal (i.e. the fast component  of  the output current), thus a high bandwidth of  the  front-end  is  needed with values of about few hundreds of megahertz and low electronics noise [14,15,81]. For other applications like gamma-ray spectroscopy or large experiments in particle and astro-particle physics (e.g. [65]), the time resolution is not critical but the signal-to-noise ratio is important. In these cases the signal is shaped or integrated, thus the fast component is filtered out.
Moreover, it has to be considered that SiPMs with large areas provide typically a smaller signal amplitude. This is mainly due to the bigger grid capacitance and due to the parasitics of the longer interconnections between the cells and the bonding pads, acting as a low pass filter on the
output current. Fig. 15 compares the average signals of a 1×1 mm2 SiPM
and a 6x6 mm2 SiPM (with the same microcell characteristics). It can be seen that with a low bandwidth (e.g. 20 MHz) the shape of the signal is similar, although the amplitude is smaller for the bigger-area SiPM. This is likely due to the higher inductance and parasitics seen in larger SiPMs additionally to a higher SiPM capacitance which lowers the bandwidth and produces non-stable responses in the front-end electronics. It can also be seen that with larger bandwidth the fast-component of the signal is still suppressed in the bigger SiPM, whereas it is clearly visible in the 1×1 mm2 SiPM.
3.4.Functional characterization
The functional characterization of the SiPM performance includes the measurement of the photon detection efficiency (PDE), the primary noise rate, i.e. the primary dark count rate (DCR) and the probabilities of the different correlated noise components. There are also important other quantities which can be measured or derived from the previous ones, which are sometimes very useful from the application point-of- view, like the excess noise factor (ENF), and the excess charge factor (ECF). These are both quantities related to the correlated noise.
One  common  method  to  measure  the  dark  count  rate  and  the
correlated noise component is the analysis of the output pulses from

pulses that are piled-up. The second problem is how to distinguish
Example of reverse I–V curves are reported  in  Fig.  14(a)  and  Fig. 14(b), for 1 × 1 mm2 SiPMs with different cell pitches, thus different
𝐺𝐴𝐼𝑁 and 𝐸𝐶𝐹 , and for a 4 × 4 mm2 SiPM. The forward bias curve can be used to extract the quenching resistor value, knowing the number of cells connected in parallel in the device. The slope of the curve, after the threshold voltage is indeed given by the parallel resistance of all quenching resistors in the SiPM. An example of a forward I–V curve is shown in Fig. 14(c).
the primary events from the correlated noise. As an example, direct crosstalk events are easily distinguishable (they produce pulses with higher amplitudes) but afterpulsing and delayed crosstalk events are mixed within the primary ones. One efficient way is to evaluate the inter-time between the events, as for example proposed in [82] and used by others [83,53]. Among proposed implementations, the method in [83] is based on signal filtering (low-pass filtering, plus DLED to remove the long tails of pulses) and peak-detection with subsequent
Fig. 14. Examples of I–V curves in reverse bias (from 5 different samples per type), of 1 × 1 mm2 SiPMs with different cell pitch (a) and of 1 × 1 mm2 SiPMs compared with 4 × 4 mm2 SiPMs (b). Forward I–V curve of 4 × 4 mm2 SiPM (c). Data are taken with FBK NUV-HD 2016 and 2018 production runs.

extraction of the signal inter-times and the amplitude (normalized to the single-cell amplitude) for each event. Others use different methods for signal filtering, for example ‘‘Moving Window Difference’’ plus ‘‘Moving Window Average’’, obtaining similar results [84]. Then, by plotting the amplitude versus inter-time and the histogram of the inter-times     a plot like in Fig. 16 can be obtained. The primary dark count rate follows a Poisson distribution, thus the inter-times have an exponential distribution. To extract the primary DCR it is possible to fit the inter-time histogram with an exponential function, but considering just the high inter-times part, where no afterpulsing or correlated noise is present. Then, analyzing the remaining part, i.e. the difference between the measurement and the fit, it is possible to extract the afterpulsing and crosstalk probabilities, as described below.
3.5.Correlated noise
Correlated noise probabilities can be extracted from the very same plots and with the same procedure described above [83]. From the inter- time histogram shown in Fig. 16 (middle), it is possible to evaluate   the excess of events with respect to the exponential fit (relative to primary generation). This excess of occurrences, normalized to the total number of events acquired, gives an estimation of the ‘‘delayed correlated noise’’ probability, i.e. afterpulsing and delayed crosstalk. These two components are generally distinguishable in plots like in Fig. 16 (middle). In this case they can be calculated separately basedon the inter-time. Referring to the specific case on the cited figure,crosstalk probability as in the following formulas.
@14

In the middle:  histogram of the intertimes (horizontal log scale and log bins),  where     the exponential fit to primary events is visible. On the bottom: histogram of the event amplitudes, normalized and expressed in photo-electrons.
@15
The maximum and minimum inter-times are chosen with a certainWhen instead the cell recharge is very fast, thus afterpulsing events appear with inter-times down to few nanoseconds, or when the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers in the neutral regions is in the order     of hundreds of nanoseconds (thus the tail of delayed crosstalk events extends up to hundreds of nanoseconds) [11], afterpulsing and delayed crosstalk cannot be calculated separately. The two ‘‘clouds’’ of events in scatter plots overlap. In such cases the summed probability of the two components can be given.
This procedure is relatively simple and can be easily implemented when the DCR is moderate, i.e when it is possible to well fit the exponential distribution of the primary generation events in a region without afterpulsing. However, it has to noted that Eqs. (14) and (15) do not consider the correlated effects of dark-counts and correlated pulses, as instead it is done in [85]. For example, at short intertimes, due to the presence of both primary and correlated noise, there will be less events due to DCR, than in the absence of delayed cross-talk. Therefore, the simple extrapolation of the primary-events via an exponential fit in the delayed cross-talk region might be correct only as a first approximation (giving a small bias). If DCR is not high the effect can be considered negligible.
In the reported example (Fig. 16), the primary DCR has been  estimated considering intertimes higher than 10  μs, where afterpulsing    is negligible. DCR plus direct crosstalk events are counted as one event  in the histogram, thus the direct crosstalk contribution is neglected. It should be noted that in other cases, when the rate of primary noise is  high or the afterpulsing is more important, the ‘‘effective’’ time constant of AP and DCR become similar. In such case it might be difficult to completely disentangle the two  contributions,  introducing  some  errors in the DCR and 𝑃𝑎𝑝 estimation. However, in case of small and medium area SiPM, as in the example, they are well separated. The time constant is just an ‘‘equivalent’’ quantity for afterpulsing, since its contribution    vs. the inter-time is actually given by a combination of the traps release time constants (one or more) and the cell recovery time.
Direct (prompt) crosstalk probability instead, can be extracted by the event amplitude histogram. Fig. 16 (bottom) shows an example where  the  vertical  axis  is  normalized  to  the  acquisition  time, thus
giving the occurrence frequency and the horizontal axis gives the eventamplitude in photo-electrons (p.e.), i.e. normalized to the single-cellresponse amplitude. The cumulative probability is also shown, which quantifies the DCR as a function of discrimination threshold. Under certain assumptions, the direct crosstalk probability can be extractedas the probability of having 2 p.e. events, over the probability of having 1 p.e. event.
3.6.Photon detection efficiency and saturationTo measure the photon detection efficiency (PDE) of a SiPM specialattention has to be given to the crosstalk, afterpulse and dark count rate. Upon the detection of one impinging photon on the SiPM the measured output signal can either be a single SPAD signal or a multiple of the single SPAD signal due to crosstalk and/or afterpulse. In order to avoid a bias of the PDE measurement by the correlated noise one method is to exploit the probability of no events detected, if using a pulsed light source [86–88,53]. One possible PDE measurement setup can be seen in Fig. 17. The light source is a pulsed light emitting diode (LED) which is diffused in an integrating sphere with a reference diode mounted on one port. Another port of the integrating sphere serves to illuminate the SiPM under test at a certain position for which the reference diode mounted in the integrating sphere was previously calibrated with a NIST calibrated avalanche photodiode. All three ports of the integrating sphere are  perpendicular to each others to avoid direct light. By measuring the count spectrum of the SiPM under test the zero peak (no photons detected) 𝑁𝑝𝑒𝑑 can be identified and via Poisson statistics (knowing the total event number 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡) the number of photons detected 𝑛𝑝𝑒 calculated,Fig. 17. Setup to measure the photon detection efficiency of a SiPM.

Knowing the number of photoelectrons detected the PDE can be calculated via the measured reference power, as reported in [86] and  in Eq. (17) or from the reference diode current, knowing the afore determined calibration factor.

In Figs. 18 and 19 state-of-the-art PDE values measured with p-on- n SiPMs for different producers at 410 nm and 525 nm can be seen, respectively. It can be observed that for a wavelength of 410 nm all producers obtain very similar and good PDE values, whereas for 525 nm HPK SiPMs are better performant. This can be due to a thicker depletion width as well seen in their higher breakdown voltage. Furthermore it can be seen that for 410 nm the PDE saturates faster as for 525 nm.     In these p-on-n devices at 410 nm the avalanche is triggered mostly by electrons whereas at 525 nm holes start to play a role (both electron and holes can trigger, depending on the absorption position). Holes have a lower and slowly increasing impact ionization coefficient. Therefore, the avalanche triggering probability saturates at higher overvoltages.
If the number of impinging photons (𝑁𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠) times the PDE is small compared  to  the  total  number  of  microcells  (𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙)  the  SiPM  output

signal (𝑁𝑓 𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑠) is proportional to the input photon signal (𝑁𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛). If the input photon flux increases, SiPMs show saturation effects leading to non-linear behavior (i.e. ‘‘non-linearity’’ effect) [89] . This is  inherently given by their limited number of microcells. An approximation of the input–output transfer function can be seen in Eq. (18) [2].

Respective plots  and  measurements  of  various  SiPMs  can  be  found  in [90]. In this reference as well ‘‘over-saturation’’ effects of some  devices are described. In this case the simple Eq.  (18)  is  not  further valid and more photoelectrons as SPADs available in the SiPM can be seen.
To illustrate the effect of saturation, Fig. 20 shows an example of measured charge as a function of energy of gamma source (either real or emulated, as described in [89]). The real behavior deviates from the ideal linear one, extrapolated from the first points, at low energies. This translates into a compression of the reconstructed energy spectrum. As an example, Fig. 21 shows the collected charge spectrum (integrating the SiPM signal) of a LSO:Ce scintillator coupled to a Hamamatsu MPPC
S10931-025P SiPM with different gamma sources, i.e. 22Na, 57Co, 60Co,
137Cs. An energy resolution of ∼10% for an energy of 511 keV can be deduced. For gamma energies above 511 keV the number of produced scintillation photons become too high and saturation effects can be observed. In a phenomenological simulation of the SiPM signal such saturation effects have to be taken into account. However, it should be mentioned that the correct description of light yield measurements with crystals is rather complex, as several effects have to be considered, e.g optical crosstalk, afterpulsing, recharging of the SPADs and so on.
4.Simulation framework
4.1.Electrical SPICE simulations
It is useful to have an equivalent electrical model (e.g. SPICE model) for the SiPM, in combination with the front-end model, to estimate the front-end behavior and to simulate the signal shape and amplitude [57,58]).
Here we report an electrical model which takes into account the parasitics of the interconnections, the multiple cell ignitions and which further simulates the physical avalanche ignition, self-sustaining and quenching (or not quenching) through two switches, one for ignition and one for self-sustaining. The threshold value is based on the value of the threshold current for the avalanche process [13,58] (which here we set to 20 μA). The schematic is reported in Fig. 22. The front-end amplifier

The SiPM parameters were extrapolated from measurements and for the simulation here reported we set 𝑅𝑞 to 700 kΩ, 𝐶𝑞 is 40 fF, 𝐶𝑑 is 90 fF,
𝑅𝑑 is 700 Ω, the breakdown voltage is 28 V and the bias voltage 33 V. Fig. 23 shows some simulation comparisons. In Fig. 23(a) we varied the number of cells in the SiPM, thus simulating the behavior of one single cell, a 1×1 mm2 SiPM and a 3×3 mm2  SiPM (as measured in [14]). In  Fig. 23(b) we compare the behavior of a 3×3 mm2 SiPM with different number of triggered cells. In Fig. 24(a) we varied the quenching resistor (on a 3×3 mm2 SiPM), from a very low value to a very high one. It can be noticed that with the lowest value, the resistor value is not high enough and the avalanche process is not quenched, whereas with higher resistor values the avalanche is correctly quenched. By increasing the 𝑅𝑞 value, the fast component changes slightly, however the slow component of the
signal is significantly different. With the highest value of the resistor the signal rapidly decreases but slowly reaches the baseline after a very long time. The signal offset in all plots is due to the amplifier in the front- end. Finally in Fig. 24(b) we varied the amplifier input impedance of the front-end amplifier. A high input impedance does not allow to extract the fast component of the signal, whereas a very small input impedance is beneficial for extracting the fast component, however, in this case can

4.2.Phenomenological simulations
The applications of SiPMs in view of light detection can be divided in three main sections, (i) single photon detection, (ii) low light intensity (multi-photon) detection and (iii) high photon rate (high photon time density) detection. In the single photon detection regime, the SPAD signal (SiPM behavior) can be described by the equivalent circuit model seen above together with the used readout electronics and parame-   ters like the single photon time resolution (SPTR), photon detection efficiency (PDE), direct and delayed crosstalk, afterpulse probability and dark count rate. These parameters and ways to  measure them have already been discussed in the preceding chapters. In single-photon detection the SiPM is working in photon counting mode, which means that the rate is low enough, hence, the single SPAD signals do not overlap and the system is adequately described by these mentioned parameters and models.
In the range of multiple photon detection up to very high photon rates the single SPAD signals start to overlap and secondary correlationFig. 25. Scintillator based detectors typically used in TOF-PET consists of three main building blocks, the scintillator, the photodetector and the readout front-end electronics.
usually neglect effects like saturation, afterpulsing or the recharge-time of the SPAD.
4.2.1. Example of time resolution simulations in TOF-PET
In Fig. 25 the detector system in TOF-PET is shown, which typically comprises an inorganic scintillator which detects the 511 keV gamma converting the energy into optical photons in the visible range ∼420 nm. These photons are emitted with a certain time structure, mostly modeled by a bi-exponential function with ∼70 ps rise time and ∼40 ns decay time constant [92]. In the crystal the optical transport imposes additional time smearing and losses, which can be modeled e.g. in SLitrani [93] or Geant4 [94]. The sensing of the optical photons in state-of-the-art systems is done with SiPMs, which gives the best timing performance of all commercially available detectors.
If one of the microcells or SPADs is fired upon sensing a scintillation photon, they give rise to a single cell signal defined by the SiPM’s equivalent circuit and the circuitry around the SiPM [95]. As discussed in Section 2.4, it arises from RC-filters and thus should only be a combination of exponential functions. The time constants are dependent on the overvoltage, i.e. the cell capacitance changes with the overvolt- age as the depletion zone will change in dimension. However, these changes are assumed to be negligible in this kind of application, and to good approximation, it can further be assumed that the time constants determining the single cell signal are independent of the overvoltage. In this case, the single cell signal can be modeled with a bi-exponential
function (Eq. (19)) with 𝜏𝑀𝑟 and 𝜏𝑀𝑑 being the rise time and fall time of

This is due to the fact that not all photons generated by the scintillation 𝑛 with 𝑛 = 𝐿𝑌 will actually produce an avalanche due to absorption in the crystal and limited photodetection efficiency of the SiPM. Thus the probability of one photon emitted by   the scintillation to produce an avalanche is 𝑃 𝐷𝐸 ⋅ 𝐿𝑇 𝐸. This process of loosing photons from the scintillation to the production of an avalanche can be denoted as random deletion,  underlining  its  stochastic  nature. The output signal of the device 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑃 𝑀 is described as the sum of the single cell signals (Eq. (20)). Because of the long decay time of a single cell signal this process is often referred to as signal pile-up.

The function ‘‘rand(1)’’ generates a random number between 0 and
1 for each photon emitted k by the scintillation process. Thus the Heaviside function 𝛩 𝑃 𝐷𝐸 ⋅ 𝐿𝑇 𝐸(𝜒 ) − 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(1) represents the random deletion due to the limited  detection  efficiency  of  the  SiPM  (PDE)  and the light transfer efficiency (LTE) of the crystal.

In the Monte Carlo simulation 𝜖(𝑘), the detection time of each photon
𝑘, is a crucial parameter as it models the entire timing behavior of the system. Four contributions to 𝜖(𝑘) can be identified, i.e. the time 𝛥𝑡 from the emission of the 511 keV gamma until its absorption  in  the crystal (at 𝜒 with a certain DOI), the scintillation statistics (given by the light yield, scintillation emission rise- and decay time), the light transfer time spread (LTTS) and the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of the SiPM. Supposing that the 𝑇𝑘(𝑝) operator generates a single random time stamp with the underlying probability density function 𝑝, then 𝜖(𝑘) can be expressed as in (21).

The function 𝑇𝑘(𝑓 ) gives one time stamp per 𝑘-th photon emitted of the scintillation process with a certain light yield, rise time and decay  time as given by the time probability density function 𝑓 . This intrinsic scintillation rate 𝑓 (𝑡) is defined in Eq. (22) as a bi-exponential function with 𝜏𝑟 the rise time and 𝜏𝑑 the decay time.

effects appear, hence, analytical statistical models or sound Monte- Carlo simulation have to be applied. The essential ingredients of such statistical models and simulations are the same phenomenological pa- rameters as given for single photon detection. Additionally non-linearity or saturation effects have  to  be  taken  into  account,  e.g.  saturation of the SiPM signal due to the limited amount of SPADs available. Furthermore, in such analysis the recharge-time of the SPAD starts to play an important role as well.
A classical application of SiPMs is to sense the emitted light of      a pair of scintillators in time resolved spectroscopy of high energetic particles, as in time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). Additionally, in high energy physics the time tagging of minimum ionizing particles becomes more and more important. It was shown that the best timing in such systems can be achieved by a leading edge discrimination of the SiPM signal [91]. Because of the determination  of the time information within the first photoelectrons detected, Monte- Carlo simulations of such scintillator based detectors, readout by SiPMs,in order that the signal tails do not pile-up causing baseline fluctuations. If the dark count rate is higher a second long recharge tail can easily be  modeled with an additional exponential term in Eq. (19). The parameter 𝐴 denotes the amplitude of the single SPAD signal, and 𝜖 the moment when  each  microcell  fires.  Typically  the  rise  time  𝜏𝑀𝑟  is  in  the  order of tens to hundreds of picoseconds and the fall time 𝜏𝑀𝑑  in the order of tens of nanoseconds. A single cell amplitude jitter caused by gain fluctuations can be modeled by a Gaussian distribution with probabilityexp −(𝐴̄ − 𝐴)2∕(2𝜎2 ) , with 𝐴̄ the mean value and 𝜎𝐴 thestandard deviation of the fluctuation. In this way mathematically the single  SPAD  signal  𝑠𝜖 (𝑡)  can  be  described  according  to  Eq.  (19).  The maximum of the signal in Eq. (19) is normalized to the amplitude 𝐴.

(21)) and scintillation light transfer
time spread in the crystal (third term in Eq. (21)) is referred to as photon
transfer time spread or photon travel spread (PTS) [96]. 𝑇𝑘(𝑔) models the photodetector’s transit time spread and gives a random time stamp generated by a Gaussian distribution. The sigma of this Gaussian is  the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of the SiPM, as can be seen in Eq. (24). Here the parameter 𝛥𝑀 denotes a possible electronic delay and 𝜎𝑆𝑃 𝑇 𝑅 is the single photon time resolution of the SiPM.

individual SPAD signals firing at the proper times, a low pass filtering is done in order to mimic the limited electronic bandwidth typically in the order of 1 GHz. A leading edge discrimination is used to produce the time stamp of the simulated output pulse, like it is done in most of the systems applied in TOF-PET. Electronic noise can be added by randomly changing the leading edge threshold around the given mean value with a Gaussian distribution, where the used sigma is equal to the rms noise level.
A comparison of the results of such a Monte Carlo simulation model with measurements in a TOF-PET like setup are shown in Fig. 27.  Shown measurements were performed in a coincidence setup coupling LSO:Ce codoped with Ca crystals of 2×2×3 mm3 and 2x2x20 mm3 from the producer Agile with 4×4 mm2 NUV-HD SiPMs from FBK with 25 μm SPAD size. The SiPM signal was readout with the NINO ASIC [98] to obtain the time information and an analog amplifier     for the energy discrimination [97]. For a general information on the
coincidence time resolution measurement setup we refer for example to [28,79,99–101] and for details on the discussed results here we  refer to [29]. The Monte Carlo simulations shown in Fig. 27 and as described in this paper further implement the crosstalk probability of

It is important to mention that the ‘‘correct’’ SPTR has to be used in the simulations (∼50 ps sigma [29]) which is the SPTR without the influence of electronic noise, in order to obtain matching results.
5.Discusssion
5.1.Impact of front-end electronics on the SPTR
For precise timing measurements the correct design of the front- end electronics is important. Especially when measuring the single photon time resolution with large area SiPMs the obtained values can be deteriorated significantly with respect to small area ones. One reason is the signal transfer time skew of the avalanche signal, generated in one cell and propagating to the readout node, which increases with SiPM size due to cells that can be far away from the common bonding pad. As well the higher capacitance of large area SiPMs creates a low pass filtering effect and leads to a smaller and slower single SPAD signal [14,15] (smaller signal slew rate 𝑑𝑉 ∕𝑑𝑡) which together with a possible higher noise level (as well given by additional baseline fluctuation due to a higher DCR) deteriorates the SPTR. Recently it was shown that with large area SiPMs (4×4 mm2 NUV-HD from FBK with 40 μm SPAD size) SPTR values below 100 ps FWHM can be achieved. This was done with a special front-end electronics, based on an RF-transformer (Balun) design, which reduces the impact of the parasitic and passive capacitances of the SiPM facilitating the extraction of the fast single- SPAD signal components [102]. It is indeed important to lower as much as possible the front-end impedance seen by the SiPM, without creating instabilities in the amplifier decreasing its gain. A schematics of the SPTR measurement setup can be seen in Fig. 28. In Fig. 29 the state-of-the-art SPTRs for different SiPMs (from various producers) are summarized, measured with a pulsed laser at 420 nm illuminating the whole device uniformly. These values include all effects, i.e. the laser pulse width of 42 ps FWHM, the electronic noise and the setup jitter. In Fig. 30 we report the estimated electronic noise components, for the different tested SiPMs. This quantity can significantly depend on many parameters of the device, e.g. the cell size, the SiPM area and the DCR. For some of the SiPMs tested it is almost negligible. It is important to notice that the ‘‘real’’ SPTR without the influence of electronic noise is a very important quantity, not only to get insight on the real timing capabilities of the device, but also as an input parameter for timing simulations. Using an SPTR spoiled by electronic noise will lead to wrong conclusions. Fig. 30 should emphasize this important point.
5.2.Considerations for fast timing and future outlook
Besides improving the electronic noise or the speed of the readout amplifier in order to improve the SPTR, at the single SPAD level the (with single SPADs or SiPMs). In the SiPM cell, the SPTR is a function ofFig. 29. Measured SPTR with a 420 nm PiLas picosecond laser (42 ps FWHM intrinsic pulse width). The SPTR in nowadays devices is around 100 ps to 140 ps FWHM for a SiPM size around ∼3×3 mm2 .

the photon impact point with observed worse values at the edges of the SPAD, where the electric field is lower, as discussed in previous sections. This can be seen in Fig. 31 for a single SPAD within a Hamamatsu SiPM. On the other hand, taking care of these edge effects (i.e. reducing the border region width of the cell or in general reducing the border effects) a much sharper transition can be achieved, seen in Fig. 32 for FBK SPADs [15].
Fast timing becomes a requirement in many domains of molecular imaging applications and high energy physics. In time of flight positron emission tomography the prompt photon emission in scintillators has the potential to significantly improve the coincidence  time  resolu- tion [92]. Prompt photon emission can be e.g. Cherenkov radiation caused by the hot-recoil electron upon photoelectric absorption of a 511 keV gamma or as well possible, but less probable, by Compton scattering with a large energy transfer to the quasi-free electron [25, 103]. Additionally hot intraband luminescence can be a possible source of prompt emission in crystals [104,105]. A CTR around 20 ps FWHM can change several limiting aspects of PET with new possibilities in PET diagnostics, pharmaceutical research or dose monitoring for proton therapy. The Cramér–Rao lower bound [106] can be used to describe the theoretical CTR improvement due to prompt photons and improvements in the SPTR. Results are shown in Fig. 33, where solid lines show the necessary SPTR and photon detection efficiency (PDE) in order to reach a CTR of 20 ps FWHM for the case of 10, 20, 30, 100 and 500 prompt photons produced at the onset of the standard LYSO:Ce scintillation

emission. Indeed already in standard LYSO:Ce crystals about 10–15 Cherenkov photons are produced by the hot recoil electron upon photoelectric absorption of the 511 keV gamma and in addition 5–10 prompt photons via hot intraband luminescence [107]. Parameters for LYSO:Ce used in these calculations are; 𝜏𝑟1 = 9 ps with 78 % abundance,
𝜏𝑟2 = 306 ps with 22 % abundance, 𝜏𝑑 = 41 ns and an intrinsic light yield of 40 kph/MeV [108]. These lower bound calculations include the additional photon transport time spread (PTS) and light transfer efficiency (LTE) or loss in a 2×2×3 mm3 crystal. Theoretically 30 prompt photons produced, could be already enough to reach a CTR of 20 ps
FWHM, if the SPTR of the photodetector reaches values of close to 10 ps FWHM and a PDE higher than 50%. SiPMs are indeed able to achieve such performance with manageable amount of future research effort.
Harvesting these prompt photons with highest SPTR in an analog system, however, will impose additional challenges on the lowest achievable leading edge threshold regarding the readout electronics, as can be seen in Fig. 34. The figure shows Monte Carlo simulations of
a 2×2×3 mm3  LYSO:Ce crystal assuming that 30 prompt photons are
produced at the very onset of the scintillation process instantaneously (Dirac delta), readout with a state-of-the-art SiPM (PDE ∼  55%) and  a SPTR of 118 ps FWHM. It can be seen that in the case of an SPTR

of 118 ps FWHM, lowering the electronic noise to zero has almost no influence on the highest CTR achievable, which is confirmed by several groups achieving very similar CTR benchmarks in their laboratory. However, if the SiPM would provide an SPTR of 23 ps FWHM, electronic noise becomes the dominant factor if the CTR should be improved by a small amount of prompt photons. This is a direct implication that in this case the highest timing information lies on the first photons detected. Considering only scintillation statistics this statement can be found by calculating the variance of the 𝑛-th photon arrival time [92,109–111] which gives the lowest CTR value for the first photon detected and increases for the subsequent ones. If the scintillation rate is convolved with a Gaussian like time smearing, e.g. in the case of relative high SPTR values (similar or higher as the achieved CTR), the first photon emitted does not deliver the best timing anymore [91,106,112–114]. Qualitatively this can be understood by the long tail the Gaussian introduces at the beginning of the scintillation emission, leaving the first photon detected with a large timing jitter, as it in theory can be detected much earlier as compared to the start of the scintillation pulse. The second photon detected, per definition after the first photon, already experiences a more ‘‘limited’’ range and, hence, shows better timing. In this sense, a low SPTR sets the best timing on the very first photons which is emphasized if prompt photons (like Cherenkov) are being detected in addition [92]. However, because of the limited electronics bandwidth and signal rise time, in this case, the leading edge threshold has to be lowered to very low levels in order to sense these very first photoelectrons, which at some point is prohibited by electronic noise. In this situation future work directed in more powerful high-frequency readout, pixelating the SiPM or pursuing a multi-digital SiPM approach might be indispensable.
6.Conclusion
The silicon photomultiplier has found its way in many applications from industry to fundamental physics experiments. It represent an interesting and versatile photodetector, being both a scintillation-light detector, useful in nuclear and high energy physics and a single-photon detector being used in low-light applications, like time-resolved optical spectroscopy and quantum physics experiments. Being a solid state device it is as well compact and robust.
The increasing number of applications using SiPMs encouraged large developments in the last years, making this device also interesting for large markets. Nowadays the detection efficiency reaches very high values, especially thanks to the very high fill-factor and optimized

internal structure. However there is still room for improvements. As highlighted in this paper, the parameters describing the SiPM electrical behavior and its functional performance are many, and they are all interdependent to each other (at a certain degree).
We described the internal microcell (i.e SPAD) structure, along with its design issues and tradeoffs, e.g. triggering probability optimization for the wavelength of interest and border effect minimization using TCAD simulations. This is a relevant topic nowadays, especially for the ongoing optimization towards higher efficiency in the near infrared.
We discussed the amplitude and gain dependence and their fluctu- ations. The cell dimension is an important parameter, closely related to the gain, which in turn affects many of the SiPM parameters, like the correlated noise probabilities, the peak separation in the charge and amplitude spectra thus the signal-to-noise ratio, and the signal duration. We introduced the equivalent electrical models and showed simu- lations of the output signals: the proper signal extraction is a crucial aspect in timing based applications, where the prompt leading edge of the signal, marking the photon arrival time, has to be preserved as much
as possible.
Finally, with this complete picture we discussed some phenomeno- logical aspects for SiPMs in timing applications. Here all the parameters, signal extraction and noise aspects have to be taken into account and Monte Carlo simulations are mandatory. The lower bound for energy resolution or time resolution can be estimated in such ways, but then many other practical parameters can limit the real performance. As an example there have been some important developments in the front- end for SiPM readout in single photon timing. Typical circuitry showed limited performances with big area devices, whereas a refined circuit design using RF specific components can perform significantly better.
