ABSTRACT
To investigate the kinetic recovery process of low dose neutron-irradiated graphite, nuclear- grade isotropic graphite IG-110U and ETP-10 were neutron irradiated using the JMTR up to
1.38 × 1023 n/m2 (En > 1 MeV) at ~473 K. In-situ measurement of macroscopic length was conducted during the isothermal and isochronal annealing process from room temperature  up to 1673 K. From room temperature to 773 K for IG-110U, and to 1023 K for ETP-10, macroscopic lengths, lattice parameters, and unit cell volumes of  both specimens recovered  to their pre-irradiation values, and this recovery process subdivided into two stages. The activation energies of macroscopic volume recovery at 523–673 K and 673–773 K were determined to be ~0.22 eV and ~0.57 eV for IG-110U, respectively; ~0.13 eV and ~2.59 eV        at 523–923 K and 923–1023 K for ETP-10, respectively. The migration of not only single interstitials but also interstitials dissociated from submicroscopic interstitial  groups  along basal planes followed by vacancy-interstitial recombination play a dominant role in the ﬁrst stage. The second stage is suggested to proceed via the motion of carbon groups along basal planes for IG-110U, and migration of single interstitials along the c-axis  for  ETP-10.  During  773 K or 1023 K up to 1673 K, macroscopic length continuously shrank with decreasing shrinking rate, even with a turnaround to swell at 1173 K for IG-110U.

1.Introduction
Nuclear graphite has been widely used in gas-cooled nuclear reactors as moderators from the ﬁrst man- made nuclear reactor up to now, due to its  low  atomic number (Z), large scattering cross-section,  and high melting point, especially with the develop- ing of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs)
[1] and very-high-temperature gas-cooled reactors [2]. Also nuclear-grade graphite plays a signiﬁcant role in fusion devises [3].
Neutron irradiation induces the changes in dimen- sional and physical properties of nuclear graphite, therefore lifetime of graphite and safety of reactors  are highly inﬂuenced by the degree of defects intro- duction. The inﬂuence of neutron irradiation on the properties of graphite has been reported by many researchers [4–11]. Based on this information, the damage induced by neutron irradiation is brieﬂy introduced here. High-energy neutron irradiation causes the displacement of carbon atoms to intersti- tial sites and remains vacancies at the lattice-sites. Interstitials become mobile with increasing tempera- ture and form clusters, and even new atomic planes. Such defects contribute to the expansion of the c-axis,
which is perpendicular to the basal plane and the shrinkage of the a-axis, which is in the basal plane.   At the same time, man-made graphite blocks are a kind of porous materials, pores and cracks have a strong impact on its properties [4,8,12]. For instance, the internal aligned pores can accommodate the expansion of the c-axis and shrinkage of the a-axis, and dominates the bulk properties. If the annealing temperature increases, diﬀerence between the  changes of the a- and c-axis lattice parameters results in the generation of new pores.
In order to extend the lifetime of nuclear graphite, thermal annealing is considered as the main method to reduce the inﬂuence of neutron irradiation. Burchell [13] has conducted an intensive experiment on the annealing behavior of neutron-irradiated NBG-10 graphite (an extruded nuclear-grade graphite made by SGL Carbon, apparent density 1.8 g/cm3), especially on the macroscopic dimensional changes. Neutron-irradiated NBG-10 graphite continuously shrank with increasing annealing temperature, fol- lowed by a turnaround to swell, and the recovery of dimensional change did not saturate at annealing temperature of 2273 K.
Activation energies of point-defects’  annihilation in graphite have ever been accumulated by Thrower and Mayer [14], etc. by means of theoretical simula- tion. Experimental observations of them are still a  few. In this paper, on the  basis  of  our  previous  work [15], in situ measurement of macroscopic dimensions by a precision dilatometer was conducted for the low dose (0.02 dpa), low temperature (473 K) neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite of IG-110U and ETP-10, the same materials with the previous study
[15] but one order of magnitude lower ﬂuence, to investigate the kinetic recovery process of low dose neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite. The mechanisms of recovery process were analyzed combined with the changes of macroscopic dimensions and lattice para- meters, and then clarify the eﬀect of neutron dose.
2.Experimental procedures
Nuclear-grade isotropic graphite specimens, IG-110U and ETP-10, were used in this paper. IG-110U is the puriﬁed-grade of IG-110, both produced by Toyo Tanso Ltd., Japan, and the latter  has  been  used  in the Japanese High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor [1]. As for ETP-10, it has been used as the ﬁrst wall materials of the JT-60 fusion devices [3]. Some properties of unirradiated IG-110U and ETP- 10 are shown in Table 1. Specimens were in the shape of 2 × 2 × 25 mm3 rectangular bars, and neutron irradiated in the Japan Materials Testing Reactor wrapped with aluminum foil. The neutron irradiation ﬂuence was 1.38 × 1023 n/m2 (En > 1 MeV), corre- sponding to 0.02 dpa (displacement per atom)  [16,17]. The irradiation temperature was ~473 K.
The annealing behavior of neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite was investigated using a precision dilatometer (DIL 402C, NETZSCH, Germany). Length changes of graphite specimens were continu- ously measured in situ from  room  temperature (~293 K) up to 1673 K with a step-heating tempera- ture interval of 50 K in helium atmosphere. The heating rate between each step was 5 K/min. The specimens were isochronally annealed  for  6  h  at each step. Details of this measurement were described in the previous report [15]. The minimum detection sensitivity of this dilatometer is less than 10 nm, corresponding to 0.00004% for a 25-mm-long speci- men. Volume changes were calculated from the

length changes on the assumption of isotropic shape change.
Lattice parameter change was measured by X-ray diﬀractometry (PW-1700, Philips, The Netherland). After isochronal annealing for 6 h at steps  of  473, 673, 873, 1073, 1173, 1273, 1373, 1473, 1573, and
1673 K, the XRD proﬁles were  obtained  by  step- scan method (5 s at 0.02°  (2θ-Cu  Kα))  step  from  20° to 90° at room temperature  (~293  ±  1  K).  Si was used as an internal standard. The unit  cell volume was calculated based on the obtained lattice parameters.
3.Results and discussion
3.1Recovery process by isochronal and isothermal annealing
Changes in the macroscopic length of neutron-irra- diated nuclear graphite IG-110U and ETP-10 speci- mens by isochronal annealing for 6 h at each step up to 1673 K are shown in Figure 1. The lengths of each specimen before irradiation were set as standards.  The recovery process started at 473 K, which corre- sponded to the irradiation temperature of both speci- mens. Macroscopic length of the ETP-10 specimen continuously decreased from 473 to 1673 K with increasing annealing temperature.  Macroscopic length of the ETP-10 specimen returns to its original length at around 1023 K. On the other hand, the neutron-irradiated IG-110U specimen shrunk with increasing annealing temperature up to 1273 K from 473 K, and returned to its pre-irradiation length at around 773 ~ 823 K. A remarkable phenomenon occurred that the neutron-irradiated IG-110U speci- men turned round to swell after 1273 K up to 1673 K with increasing annealing temperature. Shrinkage was observed in both ETP-10 and IG-110U specimens after annealing at 1673 K, but their changes appeared not to be saturated. Mostly opposite change-trends occurred  in  the  macroscopic  length  changes  of  the

neutron-irradiated ETP-10 and IG-110U specimens beyond 1273 K. Our previous study [15] showed that change trends of macroscopic length of the ETP-10 specimen of one order of magnitude higher dose is similar with the present ETP-10 specimen, however diﬀerent trend for IG-110U. Absolute values of changes were largely diﬀerent between diﬀerent dose specimens. Macroscopic length change of the same irradiated graphite, IG-110U and ETP-10, by thermal annealing was ﬁrstly measured by Maruyama [18] by applying isochronal annealing for 30 min and mea- sured length change using a conventional micrometer with precision of ±1 μm at room temperature. Decreasing tendencies of length for each specimen with increasing annealing temperature were similarly observed, however more precise changes for long duration time were obtained in this study.
The macroscopic length changes of the neutron- irradiated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens during
isothermal annealing for 6 h are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(a,b) shows the length change from 573 to 1673 K by the interval of 100 K. The IG-110U speci- men kept shrinking during each isothermal holding up to 1123 K, followed by turnaround at 1173 K and swelling up to 1623K, as shown in Figure 2(c), which showed the change by the interval of 50 K from 1173 to 1673 K. On the other hand, the ETP-10 specimen continuously shrank during each isothermal holding up to 1673 K, as shown in Figure 2(b and d). The length change during each holding step was very small, and not linear with respect to annealing time. The a- and c-axis lattice parameter changes of the neutron-irradiated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens after each isochronal annealing (6 h) step from room temperature up to 1673 K are shown in Figure 3. The average in-plane lattice parameter, a-axis, of both specimens varied in a small scale with increasing annealing temperature. As for the c-axis, both the

IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens almost exhibited the same trends with increasing isochronal annealing temperature. Both specimens swelled obviously after the neutron irradiation, and then continuously  shrank up to ~1073 K during the annealing process. The c-axis of the IG-110U specimen returned to the pre-irradiation value after isochronal annealing at around 873 K, and at around 973 K for the ETP-10 specimen. At annealing temperatures from 1073 K to 1673 K, the changes of the c-axis in both specimens showed almost constant but less than pre-irradiation values while some ﬂuctuation was observed.
The unit cell volume changes of the neutron-irra- diated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens after diﬀerent isochronal annealing steps are shown in Figure 4. The
unit cell volume of both specimens continuously shrank  up  to  the  temperature  step  at   around   1073 K. During the shrinkage process, the unit cell volume of the IG-110U specimen returned to the pre- irradiation value after isochronal annealing step at around 773 K, and the ETP-10 specimen at 1073 K. Beyond 1073 K, the unit cell volume of IG-110U specimen   was   not   obviously   changed   and   kept

As for the ETP-10 specimen, the value of unit cell volume also showed  no  obvious  change  beyond 1073 K, but slightly larger than the pre-irradiation value.
3.2Kinetic analysis on recovery process
As we have discussed in the previous paper [15], the thermal annealing process of graphite can be under- stood with kinetic models [19]. Due to low-dose (1.38
× 1023 n/m2) neutron irradiation and low irradiation temperature (473 K), the recovery processes of the defects induced into the neutron-irradiated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens could be considered basically as recombination of interstitials and vacancies,  so  that a ﬁrst-order reaction is assumed, which was considered in our previous research [15] and  by   other researchers for graphite or silicon carbide [20,21]. In a ﬁrst-order reaction, the recovery process could be analyzed by Arrhenius equation:
@1
where k is the rate coeﬃcient of the reaction; Ea is the activation energy; kB is the Boltzmann's constant; A is the Arrhenius factor; T is the absolute temperature; and R is the universal gas constant. We take the natural logarithms of (1) and get the following equations:
@2
Thus, Ea could be calculated from the gradient of the linear function between the logarithm of k and 1/T.
The relationship between the logarithms of volume changes of the IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens and isothermal annealing time at 773 K is shown  in  Figure 5. The slopes of ﬁtted straight lines in this ﬁgure represent the volume recovery rate coeﬃcients

The Arrhenius plot of the rate coeﬃcients derived from macroscopic volume recovery of neutron-irra- diated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens according to  k values is shown in Figure 6. The k values were the slopes of ﬁtted straight lines obtained by least-squares method as in Figure 5 at each isothermal annealing temperature from 523 K to 1673 K. Ea was obtained  by the least-squares method from the  Arrhenius plots, and corresponding R2 values are  listed  in  Table 2.
The macroscopic dimension, the c-axis lattice para- meters and the unit cell volume of the neutron-irradiated specimens recovered to those pre-irradiation values at the isochronal annealing temperature of 773 ~ 823 K for the IG-110U specimen and ~1023 K for the ETP-10 speci- men, as shown in Figures 1, 3, and 4, respectively. The rate coeﬃcients during the recovery processes are shown in Figure 6. In Part I from room temperature to ~773 K or
~1023 K, the Arrhenius plots were divided further and ﬁtted by two straight lines, i.e. separated into two diﬀerent stages. The Ea values were determined to be ~0.22 eV and
~0.57 eV at 523–673 K and 673–773 K, respectively, for the IG-110U specimen; ~0.13 eV and ~2.59 eV at 523– 923 K and 923–1023 K, respectively, for the ETP-10 specimen. Part II was from 773 K or 1023 K to 1673 K for the IG-110U and the ETP-10 specimens, respectively, and the specimens continuously shrank with slower and slower rate. As shown in Figure 1, the macroscopic length of the IG-110U specimen even turned around to swell beyond 1273 K.
Neutron-irradiation-induced defects in nuclear graphite have been discussed by many researchers

[10,22], and in our previous study [15]. Interstitials can move freely and tend to collide into two kinds of immobile groups. The ﬁrst group could gather diﬀus- ing interstitials and eventually form new planes. The second group consists 4 ± 2 carbon atoms and will  not grow, called ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups, which mainly results in the swelling of the c-axis lattice parameter. Carbon dimer C2 is considered as stable species in this group. At low irradiation tem- perature and low irradiation dose, as-produced vacancies keep single and immobile [8,13], and can accept diﬀusing interstitials for annihilation. The migration of interstitials and then annihilation with vacancies are the main contributor to the change of micro- and macro-dimensions with increasing annealing temperature. The migration energies of single interstitials were demonstrated to be only 0.02–0.5 eV [10], and the barrier of interstitials to recombine    with    vacancies    was    reported    to  be
~0.24   eV   by   Kelly   [22].   Values   of   0.2   eV  and
0.47 eV have also ever been suggested to be the interstitial migration energy along the basal plane [23]. Besides, motion of  interstitial  groups  parallel  to the basal plane was  demonstrated  to  be  1.0–   1.25 eV [10].
3.3 Comparison of recovery process with higher dose specimens
The recovery processes of the present neutron-irra- diated IG-110U and ETP-10 (0.02 dpa) specimens were compared with the same materials but  one  order of magnitude higher dose neutron-irradiated specimens (~0.25 dpa) [15], as shown in  Figure  7. The recovery process of the present specimens showed similar trends as a whole with the  higher  dose neutron-irradiated specimens reported in our previous study.
Firstly, as for the ﬁrst stage of the Part I recovery, the Ea of the IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens in the present  study  were  determined  to  be  ~0.22  eV and
~0.13   eV,   respectively.   Approximate    value    of   Ea = 0.15 eV was reported for the ﬁrst stage of the higher-dose-irradiated IG-110U and ETP-10 speci- mens [15]. Therefore, migration of single interstitials along the basal plane (0.2 eV or less [10,14]) and recombination     with     vacancies     (energy    barrier
0.24 eV [22]) were considered to be the main mechanism in this stage, the same with the higher-  dose specimens. In the second stage of the neutron- irradiated  IG-110U  specimen,  the  value  of  Ea   (0.57 eV) was similar with the  second  and  third  stage of the higher-dose IG-110U  specimen  (0.34 and 0.73 eV), so that C2, (C2)2, and other carbon groups may have moved along the  basal  plane  in  this stage (1.0–1.25 eV [10]).  As  for  the  second  stage of the  neutron-irradiated  ETP-10  specimen, the value of Ea (2.59 eV)  was  so  similar  with  the  last stage of higher-dose specimens (2.59 eV of IG- 110U, 2.19 eV of ETP-10). Migration of single inter- stitials along the c-axis (2.3 eV [10]) or the migration of single vacancy (1.75 eV [10], 3.1eV [14])  may  occur in this stage. Considering the temperature  range in this stage, the former was  suggested to be  the main contributor. Throughout the recovery pro- cess of the Part I in this study, the lattice parameter of the c-axis continuously shrank but the a-axis did not change obviously. It is suggested that, during the Part I recovery, not only single interstitials but also inter- stitials dissociated from ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups may migrate along the basal plane and anni- hilated with vacancies. Single interstitials may not aﬀect to both lattice parameters, but ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups expand mainly the c-axis. Shrinkage of the c-axis may  correspond to decrease  of ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups. It was note- worthy that all of the parameters measured in this study recovered to the pre-irradiation values up to around ~1023 K. One possible explanation is that neutron-irradiation-induced defects are mostly recov- ered or removed during this temperature range by the mechanism mentioned above. Another possibility is that plenty of interstitials, including those from the ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups migrate to sinks, such as grain surface (edge of grains). However, the former mechanism is considered to be the main con- tributor because volume of the specimens continu- ously shrank.
Secondly, as for the recovery process of the Part II, i.e.
higher temperature ranges than those of the Part I, the reaction rate (volume shrinkage rate) of the both speci- mens decreases with increasing annealing temperature, as shown in Figure 6. The lattice parameters and unit cell volume did not show continuous changes and mostly constant, on the other hand macroscopic volume con- tinuously shrank up to 1673 K in the case of ETP-10 specimen, and up to 1273 K for the IG-110U specimen in
this study. The latter specimen showed slight volume swelling over the onset of turnaround at annealing tem- perature of 1173 K, as shown in Figure 8. Burchell [13] reported the annealing behavior of macroscopic dimen- sions in neutron-irradiated nuclear-grade graphite NBG-
10. Most of the samples, neutron irradiated by 0.65–4.88 dpa at 548–973 K, continuously shrank with increasing annealing temperature, and turned around to swell at annealing temperature of around 1773 K. Especially the specimens which were neutron irradiated at relatively lower temperature 573 ± 25 K and 548 ± 25 K by 0.65 and 1.88 dpa respectively, swelled after the neutron irra- diation, and showed continuous shrinkage until a turn- around to swell beyond annealing at 1773 K. Several authors [24,25] studied the eﬀect of irradiation dose on the macroscopic dimensions of graphite. Graphite shrank in lower ﬂuences, in prior to a turnaround to swell with increasing neutron irradiation dose. Compared two groups of graphite specimens irradiated at 1148 K and 873 K, turnaround occurred at lower ﬂuence for the higher temperature irradiated specimens, and the max- imum shrinkage of the specimen irradiated at 1148 K was approximately 60% of the specimen irradiated at 873 K [24]. It was mentioned that the interaction of grains with pores lead to modiﬁcation of microstructure (morphol- ogy change) and caused dimensional changes and a turn- around to swell [13,24]. The mechanism can serve as reference for the turnaround in the annealing process. Overall, since the micro-parameters in the Part II recov- ery mostly unchanged, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the changes in macroscopic volume can be possibly attribu- ted to the change in morphology, such as pores and cracks. Closure of pores within the polycrystalline gra- phite reduced the internal ‘accommodation’ for micro- structure resulted in the onset of pore generation contributing to the turnaround [24]. Furthermore, the recovery process may involve several complicated mechanism, such as the motion of vacancies. Another important phenomenon is that the dimensional changes induced by neutron irradiation still did not fully recover after annealing at 1673 K. The similar results were men-

tioned by other researchers [5,25] that the recovery of macroscopic volume did not saturate at annealing tem- perature of 3073 K. Pore and crack generation/closure at higher temperature was considered as the probable causes of the non-recovery of volume.
To sum up, compare to the recovery behavior of the present specimens (1.38 × 1023 n/m2 (En > 1 MeV)) and the previous specimens (1.92 × 1024 n/m2 (En >1 MeV))
[15] irradiated at the same temperature of 473 K, general feature of recovery showed mostly the same tendencies. Degree of changes induced by neutron irradiation is larger for the higher dose specimens. In the both speci- mens with diﬀerent irradiation doses during the anneal- ing process, the macroscopic length and lattice parameters/unit cell volume returned to the pre-irradia- tion values. However, the cross-points, the temperature at which the values returned to the pre-irradiation values, are about 300 K higher for the specimen irradiated with higher dose. The cross-points of the ETP-10 specimens are commonly 200 K higher than those of the IG-110U specimens in each dosage. Lattice parameters of both specimens of lower dosage are changed gradually until the cross point temperatures. However, small shrinkage of the c-axis continued over the cross point temperature for the higher dose specimens. The activation energies for volume recovery during the Part I are subdivided into two (lower dose) to four (higher dose) stages, and also have resemble values but slightly diﬀerent temperature ranges, as shown in Figure 7. Comparing higher dose case and lower dose case, each stage with similar activation energy shifted to higher annealing temperature ranges for the higher dose specimens, commonly for the IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens. The reason for this diﬀerence is not clear at present, but may be related to an amount and kinds of induced defects. Turnaround from shrinkage to swelling of the macroscopic volume during annealing only observed for the IG-110U specimen of the lower dose.
From    the    activation    energy    consideration,    the
mechanisms of damage recovery in the Part I probably the common for graphite, i.e. not only single interstitials but also interstitials dissociated from ‘submicroscopic’ interstitial groups may migrate along the basal  plane  and annihilated with vacancies in the ﬁrst stage. Then carbon groups such as C2, (C2)2, started to migrate along the basal plane. Furthermore, the migration of single interstitials along the c-axis also happens up to around cross point’s temperatures in the second stage of the Part
I. These phenomena proceeded in the graphite crystals. At higher temperatures as labeled as the Part II recovery, shrinkage in macroscopic volume continuously occurs but lattice parameters of the crystal are mostly constant. It can be possibly attributed to the change in morphology, such as pores and cracks due to the high temperature, resemble to the sintering of polycrystalline materials. Higher the dose received, larger the amount of not only single   point  defects   but  also   small   carbon   groups is
induced into the graphite crystals, and higher annealing temperature is needed to annihilate them. Both IG-110U and ETP-10 are man-made nuclear graphite, manufac- tured by mixing, forming, baking, impregnation, and high-temperature graphitization from raw materials. Diﬀerent raw petroleum coke, diﬀerent basing method, and so on, result in the diﬀerent properties of two kinds of nuclear graphite, as shown in Table 1, including signiﬁ- cantly diﬀerent grain size and mechanical properties. The diﬀerences between the specimens, IG-110U and ETP- 10, may be attributed for the diﬀerent manufacture pro- cess, such as raw materials, heat treatment temperatures, density, and microstructure such as grain size, degree of graphite’s crystallinity, porosity, pore size distribution, grain boundary property, and so on. Similarly, Burchell
[13] has ever suggested that diﬀerences in manufacturing process were contributors to diﬀerent performances of man-made nuclear graphite.
4.Conclusions
Results for the precise measurements of the changes in macroscopic dimension and lattice parameter due to isothermal and isochronal annealing up to 1673 K for two kinds of low dose neutron-irradiated nuclear gra- phite (1.38 × 1023 n/m2 (En > 1 MeV) at 473 K), both isotropic graphite named as IG-110U and ETP-10, were summarized as follows.
(1)The recovery processes of the neutron-irra- diated IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens by iso- thermal and isochronal annealing from room temperature up to 1673 K were divided into two parts. The Part I was from room tempera- ture to 773 K for IG-110U and 1023 K for ETP-10, in which part macroscopic length, lattice parameters and unit cell volume recov- ered to their pre-irradiation values before neu- tron irradiation. In the recovery process of the Part II, i.e. higher temperature ranges than those of the Part I, the lattice parameters and unit cell volume were mostly constant. On the other hand, macroscopic volume continuously shrank in the case of ETP-10 specimen up to 1673 K, and up to 1173 K for the IG-110U specimen. The latter specimen showed slight volume swelling over the onset of turnaround at annealing temperature of 1173 K.
(2)From room temperature to 773 K or 1023 K (Part I), the recovery process exhibited two stages and the shrinkage became faster at higher temperature range. The Ea values were determined to be ~0.22 eV and ~0.57 eV at 523–673 K and 673–773 K, respectively, for the IG-110U specimen; ~0.13 eV and ~2.59 eV at 523–923 K and 923–1023 K, respectively, for the ETP-10 specimen.
(3)During the recovery process from 773 K or 1023 K to 1673 K (Part II), the changes in macroscopic volume can be possibly attributed to the change in morphology, such as  pores and cracks.
(4)General feature of recovery of the present speci- mens showed similar process with one order of magnitude higher-dose irradiated  specimens (1.92 × 1024 n/m2 (En > 1 MeV) at 473 K) from room temperature up to 1673 K. Degree of changes induced by neutron irradiation is larger for the higher dose specimens. Compare higher dose case and lower dose case, each stage with similar activation energy shifted to higher anneal- ing temperature ranges for the higher dose speci- mens, commonly for the IG-110U and ETP-10 specimens.
