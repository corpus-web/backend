Abstract
The energies of various L X-ray transitions namely Ll, Lα, Lη, Lβ1,4, Lβ3,6, Lβ2,15, Lβ5,7, Lβ9,10, Lγ5, Lγ1, Lγ2,3 and Lγ4 have been measured in 67Ho and 71Lu due to the impact of 5–11 MeV N3+,4+ - and 90–180 MeV Ag7+, 8+, 12+,14+- ions. The change in the energy values of various transitions from the standard values have been calculated from the changes in the positions of the centroids of various L X-ray peaks after fitting the L X-ray spectra of these elements using NFIT computer program. Since the energy shifts are caused due to the multiple ionization of the M-, N-, O- shells simultaneous to the L-shell ionization, the measured energy shift values have been compared to the corresponding single-hole values to calculate the number of spectator vacancies caused in the outer-shells simultaneous to inner-shell ionization. Only one M-spectator vacancy is estimated in both 67Ho and 71Lu elements due to N-ion impact while 5 −7 M spectator vacancies in 67Ho and 6–8 M spectator vacancies in 71Lu are estimated for Ag-ion impact. It is evident from the measured intensity ratios (higher than the single-hole values) for the transitions Lβ1(L2-M4)/Lγ1(L2-N4) and Lα(L3-M4,5)/Lβ2,15 (L3-N4,5) and lower than the single hole values for Lγ2,3(L1-N2,3)/Lγ4(L1-O2,3) that more vacancies are caused in the N-shell than in the M-shell and a lower degree of multiple ionization in the O-shell than in the N-shell. The number of spectator vacancies caused by Ag-ion impact has been found to be 5–7 for M- and 19–22 for N-shell in 67Ho and 6–8 M-shell and 12–22 for N-shell in 71Lu respectively.

1. Introduction
It is well known that Particle-induced X-ray emission analysis (PIXE) using proton beam has been widely used for numerous applications (Verma, 2007). The basic atomic data concerned with the X-ray K-, L- and M X-ray energies of various elements is available in publication by Deslattes et al. (2003) while the calculated K, L and M-shell X-ray line intensities for light ion impact on selected targets are available in the ANSTO Report by Crawford et al. (2011).
When heavier ions are used, the PIXE technique has its limitation due to the phenomenon of multiple ionization i.e. the multiple vacancies are caused in the M, N and higher shells (outer-shells) together with L-shell (inner-shell) which outer-shell vacancies cause a shift in the energy values of various L X-ray diagram lines (Uchai et al., 1986, Miranda et al., 2007). The relative intensities of L X-ray transitions filling a vacancy in the same subshell are influenced by the presence of additional vacancies in the levels from which the lines originate and thus the intensity ratios of various L X-ray lines also change with respect to the corresponding single-hole branching ratios (Uchai et al., 1985). Due to multiple ionization effects in M, N and O shells, a deviation of the of L-shell X-ray intensity ratios with the corresponding theoretical values have been observed by Naga Raju et al. (2004) even with protons of 1–5 MeV in a number of elements. The L-shell X-ray production cross sections of various elements of Lanthanide series have been reported using proton beam by Fazinic et al. (1994) and more recently by Miranda et al. (2012) for protons of energies between 2.5 and 5 MeV. Lugo‐Licona, Miranda (2002) have reported the L-shell X-ray production cross section measurements of rare earth elements by C4+ and O4+ -ions while Mehta et al. (2005) have presented their results on L x-ray production in 57La, 58Ce, 60Nd and 62Sm by 35–60 MeV carbon and oxygen ions.
Solid state effects for selected L–O X-ray transitions induced by O, Si and S ions of 0.4–2.0 MeV/u ions in various heavy targets have been studied by Banaś et al., 2000, Banaś et al., 2002 who calculated the ionization probabilities in M-, N- and O-shells during Lγ x-ray emission from x-ray energy shifts and line broadening, combined with a change of the intensity ratios. Their approach is for calculating the multiple ionization effects in M- and N-shell, from fitting the measured low-resolution X-ray spectra for Lγ(L→N,O) transitions using the calculated Dirac–Fock X-ray energy shifts per vacancy based on the assumption that the intensity distribution of emitted x-ray satellites is approximately described by the binomial distribution parameterized by the ionization probability at the moment of X-ray emission. Ramakrishna et al. (2002) measured the energy shifts and intensity ratios of different L X-ray components in tantalum due to 10 MeV carbon and 12 MeV nitrogen ions and calculated the possible number of simultaneous vacancies in M shell from the observed energy shifts. A comparison of Lα /Lβ2,15, Lβ1/Lγ1 and Lγ2,3/Lγ4 with the ratios of theoretical transition rates given by Puri (2007), indicate that the number of multiple vacancies in N shell are higher than the vacancies in M and O shell. Employing Larkin's statistical scaling procedure, the number of possible multiple vacancies in N and O shells are estimated quantitatively. Kavčič et al. (1997), Awaya et al. (1999) and Czarnota et al. (2006) have measured the x-ray satellite structure of various low- and middle-Z elements with protons and heavy ions using high resolution crystal spectrometers. The effects of multiple ionization and intra-shell coupling in L-subshell ionization by heavy ions were studied by Lapicki et al. (2004) as a result of which they suggested for the modification of the fluorescence yields and Coster-Kronig transition probabilities.
Czarnota et al. (2009) have measured the role of the multiple-ionization effects from the X-ray study of M-shell ionization of heavy atoms by 8.0–35.2-MeV Oq+ ions in high-Z atoms using Si(Li) detector. Wang et al. (2012) have studied the multiple ionization effect of Ta induced by heavy ions from the M X-ray spectra and found that the M3-subshell fluorescence yield ω3 of Ta target is greatly enhanced, owing to multiple ionization effect in collision with heavy ions.
With the purpose of investigating the phenomenon of multiple ionization in rare-earth elements, we have undertaken the study of multiple ionization in 67Ho and 71Lu caused by N- and Ag- ions following the technique of Banaś et al. (2002) and Ramakrishna et al. (2002) i.e. by measuring the energy shifts of various L X-ray lines of these elements as well as measuring the changes in the Lα/Ll, Lγ2,3/Lγ4, Lβ1 /Lγ1 and Lα/Lβ2,15 intensity ratios compared to the single-hole values.
2. Experimental procedure and data analysis
Nitrogen ions (N3+ of 5, 7 and 9 MeV and N4+ of 11 MeV) were bombarded on Ho and Lu2O3 targets (on carbon backing) at Ion Beam Laboratory of the Institute of Physics Bhubaneswar using 9SDH2 3 MV Pelletron Accelerator while the Agn+-ions (n=7 for 90 MeV, 8 for 107 MeV, 12 for 150 MeV and 14 for 180 MeV) on these target elements were bombarded at Inter-university Accelerator Centre Delhi using 15UD Pelletron Accelerator. The targets were prepared on thin carbon backing (10 μg cm−2) using electron gun technique and were found to be 64 and 40 μg cm−2 respectively for N-ion experiment and 16 and 10 μg cm−2 respectively for Ag-ion experiment. The thickness of the targets was monitored by a calibrated quartz crystal during the deposition process. X-rays were measured by Si(Li) detectors (CANBERRA Model SL-30160, ORTEC Model No. SLP-06165-S and ORTEC Model SLP-10180S) having energy resolution 160–180 eV at 5.9 keV in these measurements. The target was mounted inside the scattering chamber at 45° to the beam axis and the Si(Li) detector is mounted using a flange at a distance of ~ 10 cm at an angle of 90° with respect to the beam axis. The efficiency and energy calibration of Si(Li) detector was done as detailed in our earlier paper (Verma, 2017). Angular graduations are provided at the base of the scattering chamber to facilitate an accurate positioning of the Surface Barrier detector used for charged particle detection. A stainless steel target ladder assembly with equidistant holes was used to mount a number of targets. The position of each target could be changed from outside without breaking the vacuum. The beam current was limited to ~10 nA such that the counting rate in the entire spectrum region including the L X-rays was below 400 counts/s. The spectra are recorded for sufficiently long time to ensure good statistics. The corresponding background spectra on these elements using the above mentioned ions were recorded on thin carbon foils. The typical L X-ray spectra of 67Ho and 71Lu with N-ion impact are presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 while those with Ag-ion impact are presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. The shift in the labeled Lu x-ray transitions is clearly visible. The M X-rays of 67Ho and 71Lu are not shown in these figures as these are having energy values less than 2 keV.

To describe the complex structure of M- and N-shell satellites, the groups of M and L X-ray lines were obtained by a least square fitting interactive code “NFIT” (Nakano et al., 1990) workable on a personal computer as described in our earlier papers (Braich et al., 1996, Verma, 2013). The fitting method helps to separate the component lines at variable/ fixed peak positions and peak widths and fits various lines so as to minimize the residue between the raw data and the fitted components using Gaussian distribution on the assumption that the intensity distribution of emitted X-ray satellites is approximately described by the binomial distribution parameterized by the ionization probability at the moment of X-ray emission as the excited X-ray satellites, when measured by a low-resolution semiconductor detector, appear as the Gaussian profile, which is shifted and broadened with respect to the diagram line (Banaś et al. 2000).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Estimation of multiple M vacancies
The L X-ray spectrum of Ho and Lu has been identified to consist of Ll, Lα, Lη, Lβ1,4, Lβ3,6, Lβ2,15, Lβ5,7,9,10, Lγ5, Lγ1, Lγ2,3 and Lγ4 component lines. While some of the component lines could be easily seen as separated in the spectrum caused by N-ion impact, the lines overlap due to shift in energy and broadening. The energies of the component lines have been measured and the changes in the observed energy values of various X-ray lines due to impact of N-ions and Ag-ions with Lu and Ho as compared to the experimental /theoretical values listed by Deslattes et al. (2003) are presented in Table 1, Table 2. It is clear from the tables that for a particular L X-ray transition, the average shift in the energy towards higher values increases with an increase of the target atomic number.

We have extrapolated and interpolated the energy shifts for various X-ray lines for 67Ho and 71Lu as the same have not been reported by Uchai et al. (1986) in their calculations of energy shifts of different X-ray lines due to multiple M spectator vacancies for 70≤ Z ≤90 using Dirac-Fock computer program. The present experimental energy shifts are compared with the extrapolated and interpolated values of theoretical energy shifts and the possible number of spectator vacancies in M-shell are estimated in both 67Ho and 71Lu elements. From energy shift of Lβ1 and Lγ1 component lines, only one M-spectator vacancy is estimated, in 67Ho and 71Lu elements, due to N-ion impact. From energy shifts of Ll, Lα, Lβ1, Lγ1 and Lγ23 (presented in Table 2), 5–7 M spectator vacancies in 67Ho and 6–8 M spectator vacancies in 71Lu are estimated for Ag-ion impact.
3.2. Estimation of multiple vacancies in N and O-shell
To extract information about the degree of multiple ionization in the outer-shells of the target elements, due to the impact of N- and Ag-ions, the intensity ratios for various L X-ray lines of Ho and Lu were calculated as described in our earlier paper (Braich et al., 1996). The measured L-shell x-ray intensity ratios Lγ2,3/Lγ4, Lβ1/Lγ1 and Lα/Lβ2,15 for 67Ho and 71Lu are presented in Table 3, Table 4. The theoretical values of these intensity ratios, given by Puri (2007), have also been presented for comparison.

Lα/Ll	21.3 ± 0.8	10.6 ± 0.3	23.4

Intensity Ratio	Average experimental intensity ratios for 5–11 MeV N→ Lu	Average experimental intensity ratios for 90–180 MeV Ag→ Lu	Branching Ratios for 71Lu by Puri (2007)
Lγ2,3/Lγ4	5.8 ± 0.3	2.7 ± 0.3	7.5
Lβ1/Lγ1	6.9 ± 0.3	9.5 ± 0.7	5.6
Lα/Lβ2,15	5.8 ± 0.2	6.2 ± 0.3	5.8
Lα/Ll	19.5 ± 0.8	7.2 ± 0.5	22.3
It is clearly seen from Table 3, Table 4 that the intensity ratio Lα(L3-M4,5)/Ll (L3-M1), for which both transitions filling the L3-vacancy (2p3/2) originate from the same shell (M-shell), is nearly equal for the N-ion impact, but it is much less for Ag-ion impact as compared to the ratio of transition rates for single-hole values given by Puri (2007). This indicates that for Ag-ion impact, more number of simultaneous vacancies are produced in M4,5 shells as compared to M1 -shell. The situation is quite complex when we consider the intensity ratios of the L X-ray transitions originating from different shells. The measured intensity ratios of the transitions Lβ1(L2-M4)/Lγ1(L2-N4) and Lα(L3-M4,5)/Lβ2,15 (L3-N4,5) i.e. originating from M- and N-shells, have been found to be higher than the single-hole values given by Puri (2007). This implies that more vacancies are caused in the N-shell than in the M-shell. The observed intensity ratios of Lγ2,3(L1-N2,3)/Lγ4(L1-O2,3)are lower than the single hole ratios suggesting a lower degree of multiple ionization in the O-shell than in the N-shell.
As given by Banaś et al. (2002) and Ramakrishna et al. (2002), the number of spectator vacancies in the N- and O-shells have been quantitatively determined using the scaling procedure in which the single-hole emission rates are multiplied by a statistical scaling factor (ns-Vs)/ns, represented by Eq. (1). Here ns is the number of electrons in the neutral atom (nM = 18, nN = 32) and Vs is the number of vacancies in the multiply ionized atom for the Sth shell (S = M, N, O …).
(1)
From the measured Lβ1(L2-M4)/Lγ1 (L2-N4) and Lα(L3-M4,5)/ Lβ2,15 (L3-N4,5) branching ratios, we have calculated the number of spectator vacancies in the N-shell as 19–22 and 5–7 for M-shell vacancies in 67Ho and 12–22 N-shell vacancies for 6–8 M-shell vacancies in 71Lu using the above said procedure. The present results are in conformity with those of Uchai et al. (1985) who have calculated the spectator vacancies of 7 and 20 in the M- and N- shells corresponding to a single L-shell vacancy for 1 MeV/u−1 Ag-ion impact on Pt.
To determine the O-shell spectator vacancies, number of electrons in the Oth shell (no) = 7 and 11 in Ho and Lu respectively were substituted in Eq.(1). It has not been possible to estimate the O-shell vacancies since (Lγ2,3/Lγ4)exp values both for 67Ho and 71Lu are too small compared to the theoretical values.
4. Conclusion
The present measurements indicate higher average shift with an increase of the target atomic number for any of the L X-ray transition, From energy shift of Lβ1 and Lγ1 component lines, only one M-spectator vacancy is estimated in both 67Ho and 71Lu elements due to N-ion impact. From energy shifts of Ll, Lα, Lβ1, Lγ1 and Lγ23, 5–7 M spectator vacancies in 67Ho and 6–8 M spectator vacancies in 71Lu are estimated for Ag-ion impact. The measured intensity ratios of the transitions Lβ1(L2-M4)/Lγ1(L2-N4) and Lα(L3-M4,5)/Lβ2,15 (L3-N4,5) i.e. originating from M- and N-shells, which have been found to be higher than the single-hole values imply that more vacancies are caused in the N-shell than in the M-shell. The observed intensity ratios of Lγ2,3(L1-N2,3)/Lγ4(L1-O2,3) which are lower than the single hole ratios suggesting a lower degree of multiple ionization in the O-shell than in the N-shell. The number of spectator vacancies caused by Ag-ion impact has been found to be 5–7 for M- and 19–22 for N-shell in 67Ho and 6–8 M-shell and 12–22 for N-shell in 71Lu respectively.
