Abstract
Removing radioactive iodine from solutions containing fission products is essential for nuclear facility decontamination, radioactive waste treatment, and medical isotope production. For example, the production of high-purity fission 99Mo by irradiation of 235U with neutrons involves the removal of iodine from an alkaline solution of the irradiated target (which contains numerous fission products and a large quantity of aluminate ions) using silver-based materials or anion-exchange resins. To be practically applicable, the utilized iodine adsorbent should exhibit a decontamination factor of at least 200. Herein, the separation of radioactive iodine from alkaline solutions was achieved using alumina doped with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Ag NPs have a larger surface area than Ag powder/wires and can thus adsorb iodine more effectively and economically, whereas alumina is a suitable inert support that does not adsorb 99Mo and is stable under basic conditions. The developed adsorbents with less impurities achieved iodine removal and recovery efficiencies of 99.7 and 62%, respectively, thus being useful for the production of 131I, a useful medical isotope.

1. Introduction
99 mTc is a radioisotope used to diagnose breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney disease, and other medical conditions, accounting for more than 30 million diagnoses each year (80% of all nuclear medical diagnoses). However, in view of its very short half-life (6 h), 99 mTc is produced from 99Mo using a special generator. In turn, the parent 99Mo is produced by two major methods. The first method involves a 98Mo(n, γ)99Mo reaction, in which the 98Mo target absorbs a neutron to generate 99Mo and γ-rays. Another method involves uranium nuclear fission, wherein 235U absorbs a neutron and is split into at least two radioisotopes with lower atomic numbers that undergo further nuclear reactions to generate 99Mo and 131I as the major products. The specific activity of 99Mo produced by the above fission is ~1000 times higher than that of 99Mo produced by the (n, γ) reaction, making the synthesis of the high-purity former isotope an important and popular research topic. However, the production of high-purity fission 99Mo requires extensive separation and purification procedures due to the formation of multiple fission by-products (NEA, 2010; IAEA, 2013; IAEA, 1989; IAEA, 1998; Mills, 1995; NEA, 2015; Ponto, 2004; Snelgrove et al., 1995; Ibrahim et al., 2011). In particular, radioactive 131I accounts for ~15% of the total radioactive impurities, being capable of diffusing into the gas phase and becoming a contamination source by means of sublimation. Furthermore, similarly to 99 mTc, 131I is commonly used in nuclear medicine, industry, and research, e.g., for cancer diagnosis and treatment (Kim et al., 2014, Lee et al., 2014, Silberstein et al., 2005, Xie et al., 2010). Therefore, the separation and purification of radioactive iodine generated in the production of 99Mo provides additional benefits (Nazari et al., 2001). As shown in Fig. 1, fission gas and solid metal impurities are produced when the uranium/aluminum target is dissolved in highly concentrated sodium hydroxide (Andrade et al., 2001, Muenze et al., 2013, Mushtaq, 2011, Ryu et al., 2013). Removal of the above metal impurities by filtration results in an alkaline (pH 11) solution containing radioactive iodine. To address the abovementioned challenges, this study aimed to develop an efficient and easy-to-fabricate adsorbent for the separation and purification of iodine contained in highly concentrated alkaline solutions. A number of previous studies used silver to remove iodine (Fukasawa et al., 1969, Haefner and Tranter, 2007, Pishko et al., 2011) as AgI precipitates (Ksp = 8.3 × 10–17) (Lide, 2003). However, we adopted a different strategy, using Ag to produce materials that effectively adsorb and remove iodine present in the abovementioned liquid phase (Mondino et al., 1999). Generally, the supports utilized for this purpose are based on alumina due to its excellent stability in highly concentrated alkali solutions (Wilkinson et al., 2003). However, since the shape of conventional alumina particles is uneven and irregular, preventing the production of a uniform silver coating, we used spherical alumina with reduced surface activity and large surface area. Furthermore, unlike the conventional method, wherein mixtures of alumina and silver nitrate are reduced with ascorbic acid, this study utilized a silver mirror reaction with glucose to disperse alumina and reduce silver (Fig. 2) (Hwang et al., 2011). The silver mirror reaction could prevent the aggregation of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and allowed their uniform coating on the alumina surface, with the desired coating level achieved by adjusting the Ag precursor concentration. Furthermore, this simple method consumed less silver nitrate than conventional ones and exhibited the additional benefit of shorter reaction time.

In the case of Method 1, silver nitrate is mixed with acidic alumina, and the surface silver is reduced by using ascorbic acid in the presence of silver nitrate on the alumina surface. In the case of Method 2, silver is adsorbed on the surface of alumina while silver is reduced using reducing sugar while spherical alumina is stirred in a solution together with silver nitrate.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and apparatus
Acidic (Aldrich) and spherical alumina (DAW-70, Denka) were used after washing and drying. 131I was supplied by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute. L-Ascorbic acid (Sigma), AgNO3 (Junsei), 25 wt% NH4OH (OCI), KOH (OCI), distilled water, KI (Showa Chemical), I2 (Junsei), NaOH (Alfa Aesar), 37 wt% aqueous HCl (Alfa Aesar), Sodium iodide (Aldrich), and Sodium sulfide hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received without any purification.
Alumina particles of particular size were obtained by sieving (Laboratory test sieve, Endecotts Ltd.) and further dried in an oven (Jeio Tech). The decrease in the absorbance of KI-I2 solution was measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent), and the degree of Ag and Al re-dissolution was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer). The appearance and surface composition of synthesized compounds were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Ltd.) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; TSL), respectively. Sample color and morphology were determined using optical microscopy (Nikon). The radioactivity of 131I was measured by HPGe gamma spectroscopy (MCA; Ortec Inc. GEM 20P4-70).
2.2. Preparation of silver-coated alumina
2.2.1. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using ascorbic acid
Commercial 60–270 mesh acidic alumina was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The dried acidic alumina (20 g) was treated with 11 mL of AgNO3 solutions of different concentrations (Table 1), dried in an oven at 80 °C, and subsequently treated with an ascorbic acid solution (20 mL) heated to 50 °C for ~30 min. The solid phase was washed several times with hot and room-temperature distilled water to remove impurities (including NO3–), heated at 200 °C for 4 h, and finally filtered (60–270 mesh) to produce seven samples, labeled 1-1 to 1–7.

2.2.2. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using the silver mirror reaction (acidic alumina)
Commercial acidic alumina (60–270 mesh) was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The dried alumina (20 g) was added to a solution of the Tollens' reagent (25 wt% NH4OH (1.008 mL), H2O (89 mL), AgNO3 (10 mL; 0.5, 1, and 2 M)) upon stirring, followed by addition of 0.5 M glucose (2.750 mL) and 0.8 M KOH (5.500 mL). After the solution color change was complete, the reaction was quenched by addition of distilled water (400 mL), and the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water, heated to 200 °C for 4 h, and sieved (60–270 mesh) to obtain three samples, denoted as 2-1 to 2–3.
2.2.3. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using the silver mirror reaction (spherical alumina)
Commercial spherical alumina (60–270 mesh) was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The dried alumina (20 g) was added to a solution of the Tollens' reagent (25 wt% NH4OH (0.504 mL), H2O (44.50 mL), AgNO3 (5 mL; 0.001, 0.025, 0.05, 0.01, 0.25, and 0.5 M)) upon stirring, followed by the addition of 0.5 M glucose (2.750 mL) and 0.8 M KOH (5.480 mL). After the solution color change was complete, the reaction was quenched by addition of distilled water (200 mL), and the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water, heated to 200 °C for 4 h, and sieved (60–270 mesh) to obtain six samples, denoted as 3-1 to 3–6.
2.3. Determination of impurities in basic solutions of Ag-coated alumina
Since the production of fission Mo involves basic solutions, we characterized the behavior of Ag-coated alumina in the same. For Ag-coated alumina obtained using the silver mirror reaction, a clear and transparent solution was obtained upon addition of 6 M NaOH regardless of alumina type. However, when ascorbic acid was used as a reducing agent, the solution turned ocher under these conditions. Samples 1–6 and 3–6 (0.5 g), exhibiting a relatively uniform silver coating and commercial acidic/spherical alumina were added to 6 M NaOH (5 mL) and shaken at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were filtered, and the maximum absorption wavelengths of the filtrates were determined using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
2.4. Degree of Ag and Al leaching
Ag/Al leaching was investigated to evaluate the stability of silver-coated alumina prepared using the silver mirror reaction in basic solution. The above evaluation was performed by treating 0.5-g samples of 2-2, 3–6, and commercial acidic/spherical alumina with 6 M NaOH (5 mL) and shaking at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were filtered, and the filtrates were analyzed using ICP-MS.
2.5. Decrease of KI-I2 solution absorption as a function of AgNO3 concentration used for coating
We investigated the iodine removal efficiencies of silver-coated spherical alumina as a function of AgNO3 concentration, revealing that the absorbance of the KI-I2 solution decreased with progressing iodine removal. The KI-I2 solution was prepared by dissolving 40 g of potassium iodide and 12.7g of iodine in 100 mL water. Then, the solution was diluted 10-times, and three drops of hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) was added 0.5 g of pure spherical alumina, samples 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, and additional samples (silver-coated spherical alumina samples prepared with 0.75 M, 0.9 M and 1 M AgNO3, respectively) were poured into the test tubes, respectively. Then, 6 M sodium hydroxide solution (5 mL) was added into each test tube, followed by addition of KI-I2 (1 mL). The mixture was shaken for 30 min and filtered using a 0.22-μm PVDF syringe filter. The filtrate was diluted 500-fold and subjected to UV–vis spectroscopy analysis.
2.6. Breakthrough and Elution test
For breakthrough experiment, silver coated alumina (sample 3–6) was filled in a column with 3 cm height and 0.93 cm diameter. In this study, three columns were prepared with the amounts of the adsorbent samples 2.76, 2.93 and 3.02 g, respectively. For each experiment, test solution of 100 mL containing 1.9 mg iodine was prepared: 0.023 g NaI was dissolved in 6 M NaOH 10 mL and 1 mL of solution added to 6 M NaOH 99 mL. Prepared solution was loaded into the column at a rate of 0.9, 2.5 and 4 mL/min, respectively.
The elution test was similarly performed using 3 g of Sample 3–6 to fill 3 cm height column. The eluting mixture (1 L) contained 1.9 mg iodine dissolved in 6 M NaOH. Loading solutions comprised 50-mL aliquots of the above eluting mixture treated with 1 mL aliquots of a 131I tracer solution (148 MBq/50 mL). The packed columns were eluted using 30 mL of the loading solution at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/min. Iodine adsorbed in the column was then eluted with 20 mL of 0.8 M Na2S solution. 0.2 mL of the eluate was taken and radioactivity measurement.
2.7. Removal of 131I
The extent of 131I removal was investigated as follows. Samples 1–6, 2-2, and 3–6(i.e., those exhibiting the uniformity silver coating) were used to fill 0.93-cm-diameter columns to a height of 2 cm. The eluting mixture (1 L) contained 1.6 mg iodine dissolved in 3 M NaOH/4 M NaNO3. Loading solutions for each experiment comprised 100-mL aliquots of the above eluting mixture treated with 0.2-mL aliquots of a 131I tracer solution (74 MBq/0.5 mL). The packed columns were eluted using 66 mL of the loading solution at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, and the radioactivities of the original loading solution and that exiting the column, together with the radioactivity of a 1-mL distilled water washing solution were measured using the MCA instrument.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using ascorbic acid
As shown in Fig. 3, the obtained particles were unevenly colored and were considered to partially represent impurities or metallic silver. On the other hand, particles of 1–2 and 1–6 were uniformly colored, and these samples were further analyzed by using FE-SEM coupled with EDS.
Fig. 3. Color of silver-coated alumina (acidic) as a function of AgNO3 and ascorbic acid concentrations. Generally, the color is uneven, and silver lump or uncoated alumina is visible, but in case of 1–2 and 1–6, the color is evenly coated evenly.
Although sample 1–2 was uniformly colored, it showed an overly large surface silver content of 19.38%. The corresponding value of sample 1–6 was 3.66% lower, with the silver nitrate concentration used for coating proven to be optimal in view of the uniform and bright color achieved.
3.2. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using the silver mirror reaction (acidic alumina)
As shown in Fig. 4, sample 2-1 was very unevenly colored, containing white particles composed of nearly pure alumina and black particles composed of silver, as revealed by SEM-EDS measurements. Samples 2-2 and 2–3 exhibited surface silver contents of 17.24% and 8.38%, respectively.

3.3. Synthesis of silver-coated alumina using the silver mirror reaction (spherical alumina)
Fig. 5 shows that the color of silver-coated spherical alumina and the size of Ag NPs thereon depended on the concentration of AgNO3. The produced Ag NPs exhibited diameters of 75–340 nm, and the surface of sample 3–6 had a silver content of 12.87%. Section 1 of the above figure shows the color of Ag-coated spherical alumina, as seen by the naked eye, and Section 2 represents optical images of Ag-coated spherical alumina. Finally, Section 3 shows SEM images of Ag NPs on the alumina surface. The increasing concentration of silver nitrate caused an overall darkening, increasing the size and density of Ag NPs adsorbed on the alumina surface.

As the concentration of silver nitrate increases, the color of silver-coated alumina (spherical) gradually increases (1), and it is confirmed by optical microscope (2). Silver nanoparticles adsorbed on the alumina surface increase in size and become larger (3).
3.4. Determination of impurities in basic solutions of Ag-coated alumina
Fig. 6 displays UV–vis spectra recorded after 30-min agitation of pure acidic/spherical alumina and samples 1–6 and 3–6 in 6 M NaOH. The absorption peak at 260 nm was observed only for the supernatant of sample 1–6, suggesting that ascorbic acid reacted with alumina or silver to produce Al or Ag ascorbates.

3.5. Degree of Ag and Al leaching
The results of leaching tests performed for basic solutions of samples 2-2 and 3–6 using ICP-MS are shown in Table 2, revealing that acidic alumina showed a ~20 times higher concentration of leached Al than spherical alumina, confirming that the latter is more durable than the former in basic solution. Table 2 shows that the concentration of Ag leached from sample 3–6 was ~6.5 times lower than that leached from sample 2-2.

3.6. Adsorption of KI-I2 as a function of silver nitrate concentration
Fig. 7 shows that the adsorption of KI-I2 solution decreased with increasing silver nitrate concentration. However, at concentrations above 0.75 M, the absorption gradually increased due to the occurrence of aggregation and precipitation of silver particles.

This is a graph showing KI-I2 adsorption degree, that is, absorbance change according to the concentration change of AgNO3 used in spherical alumina coated with silver. As the concentration of AgNO3 used in the coating increases, the absorbance of KI-I2 gradually decreases but begins to increase again after 0.75 M AgNO3 is use.
3.7. Breakthrough and Elution test
Fig. 8 shows breakthrough curves according to different loading rates. 5% of saturation concentration was designated as breakthrough point. The amount of iodine removed from 1 g of adsorbent was 0.102, 0.102 and 0.106 mg, respectively. The average was 0.103 mg. As shown in Table 3, almost all the iodine is eluted at 2.5 mL. This accounts for 99.5% of the counts of total iodine eluted. The recovery efficiency is 62%.

3.8. Removal of 131I
Table 4 shows that conventional iodine removal columns filled with samples 1–6 and 3–6 achieved similar iodine removal efficiencies (99.79% and 99.77%, respectively). However, sample 3–6 featured a much simpler production method and smaller impurity content than sample 1–6, exhibiting the additional benefit of enhanced silver/alumina durability in basic solution.

4. Conclusion
Ag-coated alumina samples were synthesized using different methods and AgNO3 concentrations, and their morphology and composition were determined using SEM-EDS. In order to obtain 99Mo, the difference in the basic solution dissolving the target was confirmed by using ICP-MS and UV–Vis spectrophotometer, and columns filled with Ag-coated alumina as an adsorbent were used to determine the removal efficiency of 131I. Samples prepared using ascorbic acid or silver mirror methods achieved high 131I removal efficiencies regardless of alumina type. In contrast to the silver mirror method, the use of ascorbic acid as a reducing agent involved two heating steps, resulting in more complicated and time-consuming synthesis. Moreover, ascorbic acid was not easy to remove, introducing more impurities into the treated solution. The solubility of Al of spherical alumina in basic solution was much lower than that of acidic alumina, indicating its superiority as a support material. Furthermore, comparison of silver-coated samples 3–6 and 2-2 showed that the former exhibited better Ag stability, allowing a smaller concentration of AgNO3 to be used for its synthesis. Thus, Ag-coated spherical alumina adsorbents prepared using the optimized silver mirror method can be efficiently used to sequester 131I from nuclear fission waste.
