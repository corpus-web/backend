Abstract
To achieve trichotomic separation of light lanthanides (Ln), heavy Ln, and Am, batchwise multi-stage extractions using N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-diglycolamide (TODGA) extractant from organic acids are studied. This technique has the advantages of both solvent extraction and chromatography, which enable successive separation and management of large volumes of aqueous solutions. Malonic acid (M-Acid) is used as the main component of the aqueous phase. It is clear that the separation factor for Nd/Am from M-Acid and that for La/Am from M-Acid + HNO3 are both around 30, thus we plan to conduct these separations.
Introduction
Separation of americium (Am) from lanthanides (Ln) is important task in the atomic energy field. Am-241, which is one of the high-yield alpha-decay nuclides in high-level radioactive waste solutions (HLW), has a long half-life and strong decay heat. Thus, we have been making a plan in Japan to recover Am from HLW and transmute to stable or short half-life nuclides by an accelerator driven nuclear transmutation system (ADS) [1,2,3]. Herewith, the accumulation of Am in HLW can be reduced and its radioactivity after a 10,000-year-cooling period becomes lower than that of U ore [4]. Separation of Am and Cm from Ln is indispensable because of the reduction of matrix elements in target materials. The molar numbers of all Ln and minor actinides (e.g., Am + Cm) in 1 t of spent U are reported to be 93 mol and 2.54 mol for LWR (Light Water Reacter)-45 GWd/tHM (Giga Watt days per metric ton of Heavy Metal) after 5 years of cooling [5]. The main components of Ln in HLW are La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm and the quantities of these light and middle Ln as well as heavy Ln should be reduced from the levels found in minor actinide-containing fuels.
Because 15 elements form the series of Ln elements, mutual separation of the trivalent actinides, An and Ln, can be designed as trichotomic group separations of MA and light and heavy Ln. It is well-known that light and heavy Ln may exhibit differences in chemical behavior and trivalent An behaves like a middle Ln; therefore, separation of Am and Cm from Nd and Sm is difficult [6, 7]. Separation of MA from Ln has been extensively studied and the TALSPEAK and soft donor extractant methods have been reported [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. The disadvantages of these methods and extractants are that: they are only available for certain pH regions, the low solubility of soft donor extractants newly synthesized into n-dodecane, and low stability in radiation fields. Thus, MA and Ln separation remains challenging.
Organic acids are usually employed for pH adjustment in the separation process and their concentrations are generally lower than 1 M [18,19,20], however, there are a few reports which address solvent extractions using high organic acid concentrations [21,22,23]. In this work, organic acids are used to adjust ionic strength and thus 1–5 M concentrations are employed to achieve the unique extraction behavior of Ln and MA. The organic acids used in this work are malonic acid (M-Acid), tartaric acid, lactic acid, and citric acid (C-Acid) and these acids have high solubility in water and show weak interactions with Ln. In addition, their boiling points are 122 °C (lactic acid), 275 °C (tartaric acid), 140 °C (malonic acid), and 175 °C (citric acid); hence, it is possible perform recovery by evaporation after use except for tartaric acid.
Concerning mutual separation of MA from the 15 Ln elements, the separation factors (SF) between these metal ions may be low. In this work, we implemented batchwise multiple-stage extractions based on the method designed by Craig [24, 25]. It might be a useful separation technique similarly to chromatography which enable as the unlimited-stages. Although it has some advantages, this method was replaced by the chromatography [26,27,28]. Mutual separation of Ln and MA is commonly performed by using chromatographic techniques or mixer-settler equipment [29,30,31]. However, batchwise multi-stage extraction has some advantages over other techniques, namely (1) small volumes in each phase are acceptable, (2) it is not necessary to use costly and skill-requiring mixer-settlers, (3) this approach can combine the different stage numbers of the organic and aqueous phases [32] and (4) it might be a database for multi-stage extractions. The greatest difference between batchwise multi-step extractions and mixer-settler methods is the use of a flow system. To use batchwise multi-step extractions as a reference for continuous mixer-settler extractions, precise comparisons between these two approaches is required.
TODGA (N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-diglycolamide) is used as an extractant of Ln and MA. The advantages of DGA are (1) strong extractability for Ln and An, (2) relatively high separation factors among lanthanides, and (3) possible gasification after use which allows reduction of secondary waste. The extraction behavior of Ln by TODGA is well-known [33,34,35,36]. Due to its high extraction ability, TODGA can extract Ln species which are masked and stabilized with organic acids in the aqueous phase. By using TODGA, batchwise multi-stage extraction for separating An and Ln is investigated. The optimal stage numbers of the aqueous and the organic phases can be calculated by using their distribution ratios (D) [37, 38]. After the shaking conditions which can obtain constant D values are established, the best conditions for multi-stage extraction to separate MA from 14 Ln elements are examined.
The purposes in this work are: to establish the batchwise multi-stage extractions, to separate Am from Ln using organic acid-TODGA system whose condition is followed by CHON concept, and to accumulate the results of multi-stage extraction. Followed by the results, we will discuss how much concentrations of Ln and Am present together in a solution of aqueous phases.
Experimental
Batch extraction
TODGA (N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-diglycolamide), TEDGA (N,N,N′,N′-tetraethyl-diglycolamide) and four organic acids (see the structures in Figure s1) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The aqueous phase, which included 14 Ln ions from La to Lu except Pm, was used. The radioactivities of Am-241 and Cm-244 were used as MA tracers.
The organic and aqueous phases which were prepared under suitable conditions were contacted and mechanically shaken at 1500–2000 rpm (SI-300C, As-one) or 160 rpm (FS-003, Fine) for 5–20 min at 25 ± 0.1 °C. After phase separation, the metal concentrations in both phases were measured by ICP-OES (SPS3100, Seiko Instruments Inc.), ICP-MS (SPQ 9000, Seiko-EG&G), and a liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Tri-Carb 4910TR). The D values were defined as the ratios of [M] in the organic phases to [M] in the aqueous phases.
To determine suitable shaking conditions for batchwise multi-stage extractions, two shakers with different strokes were compared. The D(M) values were obtained with different shaking speeds and times to determine their consistency and reproducibility. The same D values in all multi-stage extractions are required to decrease the differences between the experimental and calculated results. Here, the analytical errors for these D values are considered to less than 5%, which comes from mainly ICP measurements and experimental procedures.
Batchwise multi-stage solvent extraction
Excel-based calculations were conducted and the calculation software has been used in previous papers [33, 38, 39]. Using the D values for each metal, the metal concentrations which transferred to the organic and aqueous phases at each extraction stage were calculated using the ratios D/(1 + D) and 1/(1 + D), respectively. These calculations were repeated until the times of the extraction stages to obtain the metal concentration in each organic or aqueous phase were all obtained. After these results were obtained, the numbers of extraction stages needed for batchwise multi-stage extractions could be determined.
Three types of multi-stage extractions were used (Fig. 1). The first method was to examine the Ln metal flow through the extraction stages. The two other methods involved mutual separation of Am/Ln. 0.3 M TODGA/n-dodecane in the organic phase and three types of aqueous phases (e.g., 1 M malonic acid + 0.05 M HNO3 as the 1st solution, 3 M malonic acid as the 2nd solution, and 0.1 M TEDGA/water as the 3rd solution) were employed for the trichotomic separations of Am, light Ln, and heavy Ln. It is notable that the fresh organic phase without pre-equilibration decreased in volume by 10% [33] and thus, it is recommended that both the aqueous and organic phases are fully pre-equilibrated before multi-stage extractions.
Method 1 (to examine metal flow in multi-stage extractions) The concept is referred to in previous papers [40,41,42,43]. Method 1 and For Table of Content Only (shown in Figure s2) are completely same way to do experiment with the different description. A total of five stages and nine extractions were prepared in a 3 × 3 arrangement of extraction stages. Metal ions were initially present in aq. 1′. After the 1st stage, the metal ions ([M]) were distributed to org. 1 and aq. 1′ based on the D value proportions. In the 2nd stage, the fresh aq. 2′ and org. 2 phases with no metals were introduced. The metal ions in org. 1 were distributed to org. 1 and aq. 2′ and those in aq. 1′ were distributed to org. 2 and aq. 1′ after the 2nd extraction stage. In the 3rd stage, the extractions consisted of three types and the metal ions were distributed to a total of six phases. In this stage, fresh phases were used for aq. 3′ and org. 3. The metals in org. 1 were distributed to org. 1 and aq. 3′; the metals in both org. 2 and aq. 2′ were contacted and redistributed and the metals in aq. 1′ were distributed to org. 3 and aq. 1′. After the 3rd stage, org. 1 and aq. 1′ were recovered and sampled. In the 4th stage, two types of extractions were performed with no fresh phase. The metals in org 2 and aq. 3′ or those in org. 3 and aq. 2′ were distributed again and org. 2 and aq. 2′ after extraction were recovered and sampled. In the last stage, the metals in org. 3 and aq. 3′ were mixed, distributed to other phases, and sampled.
Method 2 (to achieve high recovery of Am) Seven stages of the organic phase, and two, seven, and two stages of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd aqueous solutions, respectively, were prepared. Here, the metal ions were placed in the aqueous phase (1′) only. Followed this preparation, the 1st aqueous solutions (1′ and 2′) were contacted sequentially with organic phases (1–6) and these were then sampled for elemental analysis. Next, seven stages of the 2nd aqueous solutions (3′–9′) were mixed and shaken sequentially with the organic phases (1–7) and were then sampled. Finally, two stages of the 3rd aqueous solutions (10′–11′) were shaken sequentially with the organic phases (1–7) and then sampled. The 1st to 3rd aqueous solutions were used for the recovery of light Ln, Am, and heavy Ln, respectively.
Method 3 (for suitable separation of Am/Ln) 9 stages of the organic phase and 5, 6, and 2 stages of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd aqueous solutions, respectively, were prepared and the metal ions were placed in the aqueous phases (1′ and 2′). The first aqueous solutions (1′–5′) were contacted sequentially with the organic phases (1–6) and then sampled. The next six stages of the 2nd aqueous solutions (6′–11′) were mixed and shaken sequentially with the organic phases (1–9) and then sampled. For the last solutions, two stages of the 3rd aqueous solutions (12′–13′) were shaken sequentially with the organic phases (1–9) and then sampled.
The differences between methods 2 and 3 were sums of the stage numbers of the aqueous and organic phases. The total number of extractions were 17 and 21 in methods 1 and 2, respectively, and their small number of extraction stages were effective. To obtain high throughput ratios in one extraction stage, the number of stages of the metal solutions should be increased.
Results and discussion
Multi-stage extraction (3 × 3) by TODGA from nitric acid
Two shakers (e.g., SI-300C, FS-003) were used in these experiments and the metals employed were Nd and Dy as representatives of light and heavy Ln, respectively. Here, long shaking times and fast shaking speeds promptly reached extraction equilibrium [44], however, multi-stage extractions require many repeated steps. Thus, short shaking times are convenient in this work. The experimental results, which were followed by 3 × 3 multi-stage extractions (shown in For Table of Content Only), used the following organic and the aqueous conditions of 0.1 M TODGA/n-dodecane and 0.3 M HNO3, respectively, and are summarized in Table s1(Nd) and s2(Dy) in the supporting information. The D values should be identical; so, acceptable results for the average D values with low 1σ for nine extractions were: 0.129 + 0.037 for D(Nd) when using 2000 rpm and 10 min with SI-300C and 0.135 + 0.01 when using 160 rpm and 10 min with FS-003.
After confirming the shaking conditions, the results of metal flow obtained by the procedure which used 160 rpm and 10 min with FS-003 are shown in Tables 1 (Nd) and 2 (Dy). Here, the experimental and analytical errors are estimated to have maximum values of 10% due to the repeated extractions used for one phase. The initial Nd and Dy concentrations were 7.63 and 8.16 ppm. At the 1st extraction stage (Table 1), the initial Nd concentration (7.63 ppm) was distributed to org. 1 (1.00 ppm) and aq. 1′ (7.23 ppm). At the 2nd stage, [Nd] in org. 1 (1.00 ppm) from the 1st stage was the sum of org. 1 (0.107 ppm) and aq. 2′ (0.772 ppm) and that in aq. 1′ (7.23 ppm) was the sum of org. 2 (0.874 ppm) and aq. 1′ (6.11 ppm). At the 3rd stage, [Nd] in org. 1 (0.107 ppm) from the 2nd stage was the sum of org. 1 (0 ppm) and aq. 3′ (0.074 ppm), that in org. 2 and aq. 2′ (0.874 + 0.772 ppm) was the sum of org. 2 (0.196 ppm) and aq. 2′ (1.43 ppm), and that in aq. 1′ (6.11 ppm) was the sum of org. 3 (0.751 ppm) and aq. 1′ (5.35 ppm). At the 4th stage, [Nd] in org. 2 and aq. 3′ (0.196 + 0.074 ppm) from the 3rd stage was the sum of org. 2 (0.011 ppm) and aq. 3′ (0.225 ppm), and that in org. 3 and aq. 2′ (0.751 + 1.43 ppm) was the sum of org. 3 (0.257 ppm) and aq. 2′ (1.87 ppm). At the 5th stage, [Nd] in org. 3 and aq. 3′ (0.257 + 0.225 ppm) from the 4th stage was the sum of org. 3 (0.048 ppm) and aq. 3′ (0.42 ppm). The concentrations before and after the extractions at each stage were approximately consistent within a 10% error except for low metal concentrations (i.e., lower than 1 ppm). Thus, the metal flows through the experiments were confirmed. The results for Dy are shown in Table 2 and this table shows results which are similar to those in Table 1, although the Dy concentrations was relatively high in the organic phase due to its D value.
Extraction of Ln and An by TODGA from aqueous solution of various hydrophilic carboxylic acids
Solvent extractions of lanthanides by TODGA from four organic acids were conducted. Fourteen lanthanides were simultaneously present in the experiment to observe the Ln patterns (log D(Ln) vs. their atomic numbers) and 3 M of malonic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, and citric acid were used as aqueous phases. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Here, the pH values in these solutions were 0.67 (citric acid), lactic acid (1.425), malonic acid (0.796), and tartaric acid (0.585). Although the D(Ln) values from nitric acid by TODGA were considerably high, the D values in Fig. 2 are clearly low (for example, D(La) < 0.1). The stability constants of Ln with these acids were reported as 2.47 (K1, Nd-lactic acid); 5.00 (K1, La-malonic acid); 6.22 (β3, La-citric acid); and 9.0 (K1, Nd-tartaric acid) [45]. Ln are probably stabilized in the aqueous phases by these carboxylates and for this reason, low D values were observed. Compared to these D values, the extractable trend from these carboxylates was observed to be: malonic acid > citric acid > lactic acid > tartaric acid. The lowest D value for tartaric acid was probably due to the high stability constants of the lanthanides and the second lowest value (lactic acid) was due to its high pH value. Here we have data for An which concerns in this figure, those are Am (0.001) for 3 M CA, Am(0.085) for 3 M MA, and Am (0.0324), Cm (0.001) for 1 M LA, and Am (0.0148), Cm (0.0307) for 1 M TA.
Figure 3a shows that even malonic acid created metal complexes and stabilized Ln and Am in the aqueous phases and positive dependences of their concentrations on D values were found. To obtain high D values with these organic acids, their high concentrations were usable. It is notable that Am and Cm have similar behavior to La and Ce from the present work and MA generally behaved similarly to Nd and Sm due to their ionic radii [46,47,48]. Although the ionic radii are different (i.e., La: 104.5, Ce: 101.0, Am: 100, Cm: 98 pm) they seldom show similar behavior. Using these properties, MA can be separated from Nd, Sm, and Eu. Figure 3b shows that the D values increased with nitric acid concentrations and possibly increased the D values by addition of HNO3. It is notable that D for MA exhibited different behavior from Ln. Without HNO3, D(Am) was lower than for La and D(Cm) was similar to Nd; by adding HNO3, both D values became higher than for Gd. Although there is no known reason so far, MA may be able to be separated from La and Ce using malonic acid + HNO3.
TODGA dependence was studied using malonic acid and the results for La-Gd, Am, and Cm are shown in Fig. 4a and b. Figure 4a shows the results from using 2 M malonic acid and Fig. 4b shows the results for 1 M malonic acid + 0.05 M HNO3. The slope values indicated the quantities of TODGA which were associated with the extraction reactions and the slope and intercept y values are shown in Tables s3 and s4. The slope values in Fig. 4a ranged from 1.76 to 2.22 (except for Cm) which indicated that a 1:2 metal-complex (= M:TODGA) formed in the organic phase. The metal complexes of Ln-TODGA are generally 1:3 or 1:4 [34,35,36,37], which are different from the results obtained here. Our results indicated the coordination of MA to Ln as the extracted complex and thus the molar ratio of M:TODGA in the extracted species decreased. The low D values observed in these experiments were also one of the reasons to stabilize in the aqueous phase by carboxylate coordination. Although the heavy Ln (Tb–Lu) showed relatively higher D values than Gd, it was confirmed that the slope values were similar to 2 [49]. The slope values (Table s4) for these metals (shown in Fig. 4b) ranged from 3.21 to 3.62 and thus 1:3 or 1:4 metal-TODGA complexes formed under these conditions even with low HNO3 concentrations (0.05 M). Although the D values of Am and Cm shown in Fig. 4a were close to La and Ce, the extraction behavior of Am and Cm was similar to that of Nd and Sm (Fig. 4b), which were the expected results.
Batchwise multi-stage extraction to separate Am from Ln
It is clear from the present work that the behavior of Am was different from that of Nd and Sm in malonic acid and from that of La and Ce in malonic acid + HNO3. By using these results, we considered the experimental conditions to separate Am from these Ln. Because the SF is defined as the ratio of two aimed D values was not so high, multi-stage extractions were employed. To set up the conditions for multi-stage extraction, we needed the precise D values for such conditions. These experimental data are summarized in Table 3 in which the D values by TODGA from malonic or citric acid with and without HNO3 were compiled. As it is generally believed that D for the extractable and non-extractable metals are over and under 1, respectively, and when the same volumes of aqueous and organic phases are used, a large SF is preferable. Malonic acid is superior to citric acid because of the relatively high D values and high SF for Am from the light and middle Ln. We determined the conditions for separation of Am from light Ln to be 0.3 M TODGA and 1 M malonic acid + 0.05 M HNO3; and for separation of Am from middle Ln as 0.3 M TODGA-3 M malonic acid. The SF values (Table 3) were 28.8 (Am/La), 12.2 (Am/Ce), 2.74 (Am/Pr), and 2 (Am/Nd) for 1 M malonic acid +0.05 M HNO3 and were 2.08 (Am/La), 3.68 (Ce/Am), 8.88 (Pr/Am), and 27 (Nd/Am) for 3 M malonic acid.
We calculated these D values to determine the conditions for trichotomic separation of Am, light Ln, and heavy Ln. To recover middle and heavy Ln from the organic phase after separation of light Ln and Am, we used 0.1 M TEDGA/water. Because of strong complexation and no metal salts, TEDGA is widely studied as a masking agent for Ln and An [50,51,52,53,54]. The conditions for multi-stage extraction are shown in Fig. 1. First, light Ln, La, and Ce were flowed out in 1 M malonic acid + 0.05 M HNO3; the 2nd solution was 3 M malonic acid for back-extraction of Am, and the last solution was 0.1 M TEDGA/water for stripping middle and heavy Ln. Using the conditions shown in Fig. 1, we obtained the theoretical recovery values in the aqueous phases by calculation and the results are shown in Fig. 5 where (a) and (b) correspond to the results from methods 2 and 3, respectively. The differences between the two experimental conditions are mentioned in the experimental section. These figures show the stage numbers of the aqueous phases on the x-axis and the metal concentrations (%) at each aqueous phase on the y-axis. Due to the results of the batch extraction experiment, Gd and other heavy Ln should behave similarly to Sm. Here, another experiment was also performed and the conditions and experimental results are shown in the supporting information (Figures s5–s6 and Table s5).
Fig. 5
Comparisons of the experimental and calculation results were performed in Tables 4 and 5. The calculations and experimental results are in the upper and lower layers of these tables. Table 4 shows that over 99% of the recovery ratio of Am in the 2nd solution (3 M malonic acid) was obtained by the experiment but more than 60 and 70% of Ce and Pr, respectively, coexisted. These conditions could store Am in solution and could separate Am only from heavy Ln (equal or higher atomic numbers than Sm). The sum of the light and middle Ln (e.g., La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) recovered with Am in the same solution was over 214% (e.g., = 32.6 + 68.5 + 79.8 + 33.5%) which was more than half the value of a total 400% of La, Ce, Pr, and Nd which coexisted with Am. As the theoretical results of Fig. 5a show that small amounts of La, Ce, and Pr can be found in the 2nd solution (stage No. of aqueous phase: 3–9). From Table 5, 95.8% Am is present in 3 M malonic acid and recovery (%) of Am mainly consisted of La, Ce, Pr, and Nd and the total recovery was 65.1% (e.g., = 1.9 + 15.5 + 33.1 + 14.6%) which indicated that complete separation of Am from La, Sm and other heavy Ln was achieved. Figure 5b also shows the presence of slight amounts of Ce and Pr in the 2nd solution (stage No. aqueous phase: 6–11). Light and middle Ln coexisting with Am were approximately 16% (= 65.1/400%) as average values of the four Ln metals. This result will lead a minor actinide-containing fuels of composition: 2.26 mol of Am with 12.9 mol of Ln from initial HLW (e.g., 93 mol of Ln (La: 11.8, Ce: 23.2, Pr: 10.6, Nd: 37.9, Sm: 7.2, Eu: 1.23 and Gd: 1.1 mol) and 2.36 mol of Am) [5]. There is a certain difference between calculation and experiment in Tables 4 and 5, especially La, Ce, Pr in Table 4 and Ce, Pr, Nd in Table 5.
Table 4 Recovery (%) of metal by method 2
Table 5 Recovery (%) of metal by method 3
From the present work, a trichotomic separation method among light Ln, heavy Ln, and Am is developed and is one of the available separation methods of An from the 15 Ln metals. This method aims to decrease the matrix Ln from minor actinide-containing fuels and hence is not expected to separate completely Am. We can set up good conditions for separating Am from Ln by using a relatively simple extraction system using TODGA with malonic acid and HNO3. In this work, TEDGA is used for recovery of the middle and heavy Ln and the same effect by using EDTA was found if Na salt was negligible for the elemental analysis.
Conclusion
Trichotomic separation of light Ln, heavy Ln, and Am using the conditions of three aqueous and one organic phase are studied. Commercially available malonic acid and HNO3 are employed in the main separation components. It is clarified that the SF values using the TODGA extractant are 28.8 (Am/La), 12.2 (Am/Ce), 2.74 (Am/Pr), and 2 (Am/Nd) with 1 M malonic acid +0.05 M HNO3 and are 2.08 (Am/La), 3.68 (Ce/Am), 8.88 (Pr/Am), and 27 (Nd/Am) with 3 M malonic acid. Thus, the aqueous phases used in this work are 1 M malonic acid + 0.05 M HNO3 (for flow-out of light Ln), 3 M malonic acid (for back-extraction of Am), and 0.1 M TEDGA/water (for recovery of middle and heavy Ln) and two conditions of batchwise multi-stage extraction are conducted. By using method 2, complete Am recovery of over 99% in the 2nd solution is possible but more than half the amount of total Ln coexisted. Using method 3, more than 95% recovery of Am with an average of 16% of all Ln present in the HLLW is achieved. The present work successfully demonstrated that the trichotomic method is useful for separating Am from 14 Ln metals. This is preliminary work, so precise separation using higher numbers of extraction stages will be conducted in near future to obtain higher Am yield with lower Ln concentrations in one solution.
