Abstract
This paper describes the novel approach for preparation of [18F]flumazenil ([18F]FMZ), well known radioligand for assessment of GABAA receptors by PET. The optimized reaction conditions allowed us to implement commercially available SPE cartridges for [18F]FMZ purification avoiding HPLC. All procedures were performed with TRACERlab FX N Pro synthesizer in 53 min. Developed approach provided [18F]FMZ with high RCP (> 97%) and low level of chemical impurities (< 5 µg/mL). FMZ was routinely synthesized in 6.4 ± 0.7% RCY at EOS (not decay corrected, n = 8) and the molar radioactivity was > 185 GBq/μmol.

1. Introduction
Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-receptors is part of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system. They are located on neuronal membranes and have specific sites for the binding of GABA and some other modulators. Benzodiazepines are the most important allosteric modulators enhancing the GABA impact on the GABAA receptor via the benzodiazepine binding sites (Sigel and Steinmann, 2012). These receptors play an important role in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, panic disorder, dementia, acute stroke, alcoholism. The highest density of GABAA receptors was observed in cerebral cortex, the medium density in hippocampus and a relatively low in the pons and medulla (Andersson and Halldin, 2013). Flumazenil (ethyl 8-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) has the highest selectivity and affinity for GABAA receptors (Ki~1 nM) in comparison with other benzodiazepines and competitively inhibits the effects of benzodiazepines. Therefore, flumazenil has been used as an antidote for the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose (Doyle et al., 1998).
Radiolabeled analogs of flumazenil are important radiopharmaceuticals for the assessment of the GABAA receptors density by positron emission tomography (PET) that provides information which allows detecting epileptic foci (Vivash et al., 2014) and cortical damage after stroke or trauma (Geeraerts et al., 2011). It has also been used to examine patients with disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, degenerative disorders of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, ischemic stroke (Heiss et al., 2007) and to support drug development (Declercq et al., 2016).
Flumazenil labeled with carbon-11 ([11C]FMZ) was the first radioligand for PET imaging of the GABAA system (Mazière et al., 1984) and the gold reference for GABAA receptors evaluation, but short half-life of carbon-11 (T1/2 = 20.4 min) imposes requirements upon the duration of the radiochemical synthesis and following PET study. Application of relatively long-lived isotope, fluorine-18 (T1/2 = 109.8 min) allows overcoming these limitations. Introduction of fluorine-18 in “native” position of flumazenil molecule does not effect on its biochemical behavior. An additional advantage is to obtain several clinical doses of the radiopharmaceutical per synthesis for delivering to PET centers that are not equipped with a cyclotron and radiochemistry unit. Synthesis of radiofluorinated flumazenil analog ([18F]FMZ) by nucleophilic substitution of nitro group in the nitromazenil molecule (ethyl 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-8-nitro-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) with no carrier added (n. c. a.) [18F]fluoride was proposed more than ten years ago (Ryzhikov et al., 2005), Scheme 1. And further results of PET clinical studies were revealed that the binding data and biochemical behavior of [11C]FMZ and [18F]FMZ were similar (Odano et al., 2009).

Scheme 1. [18F]FMZ synthesis via radiofluorination of nitromazenil.
The main problems limiting wider clinical use of [18F]FMZ produced via the method (Ryzhikov et al., 2005) are relatively low reproducibility of [18F]incorporation rate and the losses on the HPLC purification and post-formulation steps (Massaweh et al., 2009, Moon et al., 2011).
The great value of [18F]FMZ for PET imaging becomes the driving force for the development of new effective radiofluorination method with use of diaryliodonium tosylate (Moon et al., 2011, Moon et al., 2014) or aryl boronic ester precursors (Preshlock et al., 2016) instead of nitromazenil as well as for optimization of the existing method (Massaweh et al., 2009). The search for a new radioligand having the imidazobenzodiazepine structure and possessing biochemical properties similar to [18F]FMZ is creating new lines of the cBZR research field (Jackson et al., 2013, Jackson et al., 2014). Despite these, the [18F]FMZ preparation via radiofluorination with nitromazenil (Scheme 1) remains common way for the clinical production (Andersson and Halldin, 2013, Jackson et al., 2014).
In our recent work, we suggested a solid phase extraction (SPE) method instead of a time-consuming HPLC purification for the [18F]FMZ preparation operated with home-made semi-automatic module (Nasirzadeh et al., 2016). The main problem in the SPE approach was that [18F]FMZ and nitromazenil had similar physicochemical properties. But the latter was more lipophilic then [18F]FMZ and hence it was better retained on the reversed phase sorbent. Therefore we suggested the separation procedure, which consisted in loading of crude reaction mixture on an Oasis HLB 6 сс microcolumn with following fractional elution by aqueous solutions with increasing ethanol content. In preliminary studies with low starting activities of [18F]fluoride (~ 1 GBq) that procedure allowed to obtain [18F]FMZ with radiochemical purity > 95% coupled with traces of nitromazenil (~ 4 μg/mL).
In the current work, our main efforts are focused on implementation of suggested SPE purification procedure of [18F]FMZ to fully automated synthesizer GE TRACERlab FX N Pro for routine clinical applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Radiosynthesis of [18F]FMZ
The radioligand was produced via standard nucleophilic radiofluorination of nitromazenil employing the complex of [18F]fluoride with kryptofix 2.2.2 ([K 2.2.2]K+[18F]-) in DMF (Scheme 1, (Ryzhikov et al., 2005)). All synthesis and purification procedures were performed on GE TRACERlab FX N Pro synthesizer (Fig. 1). [18F]FMZ synthesis was carried out in a Reactor 1 (volume ~ 10 mL) suitable for dilution of reaction mixture with water to 8–9 mL in order to accomplish the following SPE step.
Fig. 1. Scheme of the modified GE TRACERlab FX N Pro synthesizer for [18F]FMZ preparation.
As shown previously in Nasirzadeh et al. (2016), it was important to minimize the amount of precursor for [18F]FMZ separation via SPE procedure. Therefore, radiofluorination was performed with 1.5 ± 0.1 mg (0.0045 mmol) of nitromazenil dissolved in 1.5 mL DMF. In order to avoid thermal degradation of [18F]FMZ and nitromazenil on the surface of the reactor, the volume of DMF less than 1.5 mL was not recommended. Radionuclide [18F]fluoride (10–27 GBq) was separated by passing through QMA Light cartridge. Recovery of [18F]fluoride from QMA was achieved by elution with the solution containing K 2.2.2 and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in acetonitrile/water (96/4, v/v) mixture, named also “QMA eluent”, commonly used for obtaining of the reactive [K 2.2.2]K+[18F]- complex in nucleophilic radiofluorinations, (Gomzina et al., 2001). Due to low nitromazenil levels, the amount of K2CO3 in QMA eluent was also reduced to prevent degradation of nitromazenil and the labeled product during fluorination, (Ryzhikov et al., 2004).
Based on the foregoing the [18F]fluorination rate according to radio-TLC analysis of the reaction mixture was 23 ± 5% (n = 10) under optimal reaction conditions (140 °C, 20 min).
2.2. Purification of [18F]FMZ
2.2.1. SPE purification of [18F]FMZ (Method 1, line a in Fig. 1)
The reaction mixture was diluted with acidified water (pH 3.5), and passed through Oasis HLB 6 cc microcolumn for the preliminary purification (SPE1) by using aqueous ethanol solutions with increasing ethanol content. We observed the breakthrough of [18F]FMZ at a high loading flow rate of the reaction mixture. The breakthrough disappeared at a slow rate of loading and washing, this can apparently be explained by the enhanced interaction of the analyte and the sorbent. In order to make the SPE procedure more efficient we have chosen the optimal flow rate for loading and elution processes (~ 2–4 mL/min). To obtain this flow rate in the GE TRACERlab FX N pro module, it was necessary to have a slight positive pressure of carrier gas (nitrogen). It was achieved when V19 valve was opened in 0.2 s before the every SPE operation. The reaction mixture transferring to HLB was operated in the following sequence: V5 opened and V20 closed, V19 opened together with V5 for H2O addition to Reactor1, then closed.
Oasis HLB column was rinsed with water and then with 20% EtOH/H2O, wherein the hydrophilic radioactive and chemical impurities (including DMF) were washed out (eluate I, Fig. 2). There were no [18F]FMZ and nitromazenil breakthroughs to eluate I, as shown by HPLC analysis (Ia, Ib). The radioligand fraction was eluted by 60% EtOH/H2O (Fig. 2, IIa, IIb). Content of [18F]FMZ in eluate was > 95% (IIa), and although the main part of nitromazenil and lipophilic species were bound tightly to the stationary phase on the HLB, small amounts of precursor and other chemical impurities (20–40 µg) was co-eluted with the radioligand (IIb). Therefore, an additional purification step (SPE2) was required to remove these chemical impurities from eluate II.

A – [18F]FMZ (black peaks) detected with radio-detector; B – nitromazenil (shaded peaks) detected with UV 254. Eluates: I – 20% EtOH/H2O and II – 60% EtOH/H2O after Oasis HLB 6 cc microcolumn (SPE1); III – 8% EtOH/H2O and IV – 20% EtOH/phosphate buffer (pH = 3.5) after tC18 light (SPE2).
In preliminary “cold” experiments, the SPE2 purification process was optimized with respect to the type of SPE reverse-phase cartridge (C18 Plus, tC18 or tC18 light), trapping volume of organic solvent (ethanol) and aqueous buffer (acetate or phosphate with pH from 6 to 3.5). As a result we chose a tC18 light cartridge and following purification procedure: the eluate II comprising [18F]FMZ was diluted with water (1:15) and passed through the tC18 light followed by rinsing with water. Chemical and residual radiochemical impurities were removed by eluting with 8% EtOH/H2O (Fig. 2, IIIa, IIIb). The [18F]FMZ breakthrough at this step was 4–9% (Table 1). Finally, [18F]FMZ was recovered by 20% EtOH/phosphate buffer pH = 3.5 (Fig. 2, IVa, IVb). As shown in Table 1, the maximal losses of [18F]FMZ were at SPE1 step, losses of [18F]FMZ radioactivity at the secondary purification step were minor. The [18F]FMZ recovery via Method 1 was 40–50%. Produced activity of radioligand was 0.8–2.3 GBq in one batch with radiochemical yield (RCY) – 9.0 ± 1.0%, (n = 6) decay corrected at EOB (end of bombardment) within approx. 53 min.

The precursor for [18F]FMZ is non-toxic and is expected to have an affinity for GABAA receptors. Unfortunately, there are no data available on binding affinity of nitromazenil as well as amount limits in clinical dose. The limiting amount of desmethyl precursor in the [11C]flumazenil preparations is ≤ 5 µg/dose, (Flumazenil(N-[11C]methyl) injection, 2008).
As a rule, a high molar activity is required for PET receptor studies, since the receptor density is low and the amount of non-radioactive compound co-injected with radiopharmaceutical should not saturate all receptor sites of interest. Usually about 1% of the receptor sites may be occupied by radioligand and its unlabeled analog. As previously shown (Pappata et al., 1988), labeled flumazenil can be used with a relatively low molar activity (< 37 GBq/µmol), since would take at least 100 nM or 1.5 mg/kg of “cold” ligand to occupy 2% of the benzodiazepine sites of the GABAA receptor.
According to HPLC data, the molar activity of [18F]FMZ in the resulting 4% ethanol solution exceeded 185 GBq/µmol at the end of synthesis (EOS) for Method 1, (Table 2).

Since the content of nitromazenil in the product could not be neglected, we also gave here the values of the apparent molar activity in the [18F]FMZ preparations obtained using SPE (10–25 GBq/µmol) and HPLC (34–53 GBq/µmol), respectively.
2.2.2. HPLC purification of [18F]FMZ (Method 2, line b in Fig. 2)
This approach included a semi-preparative HPLC purification, preliminary and final SPE steps (SPE1 + HPLC + SPE2). HPLC is not always effective for the removal of radioactive impurities from the crude reaction mixture because of the [18F]fluoride peak tailing, especially, if the pH of HPLC eluent < 5 (Ory et al., 2015), (an eluent with this pH is normally used for [18F]FMZ purification). Therefore, a preliminary purification on C18 cartridge is usually performed to remove these impurities (Oh et al., 2005). In our work-up the crude reaction mixture diluted with water was passed through C18 cartridge (SPE1) followed rinsing with water. The fraction comprising [18F]FMZ was eluted from cartridge with 1 mL of acetonitrile then diluted with 3 mL of H2O before injection into HPLC. Since a HPLC mobile phase contained 25% of organic solvent, an addition re-formulation step after completing HPLC purification was necessary to obtain a solution suitable for intravenous injection. The HPLC eluate after dilution with water was passed through the second C18 cartridge (SPE2). After rinsing with water, the product fraction collected on cartridge was recovered by 1 mL of 50% EtOH/H2O.
This procedure resulted in a higher quality of [18F]FMZ (radiochemical purity > 99% and nitromazenil amounts < 0.5 µg/mL) in 80 min (Table 2). The RCY was ~ 3% at EOB.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we report a novel automated [18F]flumazenil synthesis based on a simple cartridge two-step SPE procedure which substitutes an HPLC purification. SPE approach results in a significant decrease in purification time and the product losses as compared to HPLC, it is much more simple, attractive for implementation into any automated synthesis modules, and economical due to employing commercially available cartridges. Suggested approach provides an optimum of product quality regarding radiochemical purity and separation from non-radioactive impurities.
4. Experimental
4.1. General
The enriched [18O]H2O (> 97%) for [18F]fluoride production was purchased from Global Research Technologies, Inc. (St Petersburg, Russia). The labeling precursor, nitromazenil (98%) and non-radioactive standard, flumazenil (98%) were obtained from Pharmasynth (Tartu, Estonia). Other compounds included EtOH (96%) and MeOH (99.9%) from Merck; acetonitrile (MeCN, 99.97%) from Kriochrom, (Saint-Petersburg, Russia); 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo [8.8.8] hexacosane (kryptofix 2.2.2 or K 2.2.2), DMF over molecular sieves (H2O ≤ 0.01%), ≥ 99.8%, anhydrous K2CO3 (99%) all from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cartridges containing tetramethylammonium anion exchange resin (QMA light, Waters) were activated with 0.5 M K2CO3 (10 mL) and water (15 mL) immediately before use; microcolumns (Oasis HLB 6cc, Waters) and cartridges (C18 plus and tC18 Light, Waters) were conditioned by passing EtOH (4 mL) and water (10 mL). Lipophilic sterile membrane filters Millex GV (0.22 µm) were from Millipore.
“QMA eluent” was prepared as described in Gomzina et al. (2001): kryptofix 2.2.2 (99 ± 1 mg, 0.25 mmol) and K2CO3 (20 ± 1 mg, 0.12 mmol) were dissolved in Milli Q deionized water (0.90 ± 0.05 mL) and acetonitrile (20 mL). A phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) was prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (6.8 g) in 100 mL of Milli Q water, pH was adjusted to 3.5 with conc. H3PO4.
The yield of radiofluorination and radiochemical identity of [18F]FMZ were determined using radio-TLC and radio-HPLC. Radio-TLC was performed on Sorbfil plates with a UV indicator (Lenchrom, St. Petersburg, Russia) with AcOEt/EtOH/H2O (v/v = 80/15/5) as a mobile phase. The distribution of the radioactivity over the plate was measured with a MiniGITA radio-TLC scanner (Raytest, Germany). The Rf value for [18F]fluoride and [18F]FMZ are 0.06 and 0.50, respectively. Analytical radio-HPLC was performed on a Dionex HPLC system (USA) with radio- and UV (λ = 254 nm) detectors and ACE reverse-phase C-18 HL column 250 × 4.6 mm, (Aberdeen, Scotland). The elution was done with 0.01 M H3PO4/MeCN (v/v = 3/1) at flow rate 1.5 mL/min. The retention times of flumazenil, and nitromazenil were 8.7 ± 0.5 and 11.0 ± 0.5 min, respectively. The molar activity of the final [18F]FMZ solution was determined by HPLC via a UV calibration curve. The apparent molar activity was calculated considering the total amount of “cold” flumazenil and nitromazenil. The residual amounts of DMF was determined by HPLC (Gilson 305 pump, Rheodyne-7125 injector), UV detector Gilson-116 (210 nm), Supelco LC-18 column (150 × 4.6 mm), 0.01 M H3PO4 as an eluent, flow rate 1 mL/min. The kryptofix 2.2.2 residue level was determined by TLC on Sorbfil plates in comparison to a reference standard solution of kryptofix 2.2.2 (0.1 mg/mL) using 25% aq.NH4OH/CH3OH (1/9) as an eluent. The kryptofix 2.2.2 concentration was < 0.1 mg/mL.
In semi-preparative HPLC purification approach μ-Bondapak C18-column (300 × 7.8 mm) was used.
N. c. a. [18F]fluoride was produced via 18O(p,n)18F nuclear reaction by proton irradiation (16.5 MeV, 30 µA) of the enriched [18O]H2O target in PETtrace cyclotron (GE HealthCare).
4.2. General procedures
4.2.1. Radiosynthesis of [18F]FMZ
[18F]Fluoride was adsorbed on QMA cartridge, afterwards, radionuclide was eluted with mixture of “QMA eluent” (1.5 mL) and acetonitrile (0.5 mL) (vessel 1, Fig. 1) into reactor. A temperature was raised up to 140 °C after solvent evaporation under vacuum at 100–110 °C in 6 min to dryness, and nitromazenil (1.5 ± 0.1 mg, 0.0045 mmol) in 1.5 mL of DMF (3) was added. The radiofluorination process was performed at 140 °C in 20 min. [18F]FMZ was separated from reaction mixture by SPE (SPE1+SPE2) with single-use reverse-phase cartridges only (Section 4.2.2 Method 1) or by semi-preparative HPLC with a pre-purification and final formulation by SPE: SPE1+HPLC+SPE2 (Section 4.2.3 Method 2).
4.2.2. Method 1. SPE purification of [18F]FMZ (line a in Fig. 1)
Oasis HLB 6cc micro column for the SPE1 step and tC18 light cartridge for SPE2 step were used. After reaction mixture cooling an acidic water (7 mL, pH = 3.5) from (5) was added and the crude reaction mixture was loaded on Oasis HLB 6cc (SPE1). The column was washed with water (4 mL, 6) then with 20% EtOH/H2O solution (3 mL, 7) flushed with nitrogen after each washing. The [18F]FMZ fraction was eluted with 60% EtOH/H2O solution (2 mL, 8) and diluted up to 30 mL with water in flack for dilution (12). This aqueous solution passed through a tC18 light cartridge (SPE2). The cartridge was washed with water (4 mL, 9) then with 8% EtOH/H2O solution (3 mL, 10). Finally, [18F]FMZ was recovered from tC18 light by 20% EtOH/phosphate buffer (1 mL, pH = 3.5) from (11) and added to vessel prefilled with 8% EtOH/H2O (3 mL, 13). After stirring the final solution was sterilized by passing through a Millex GV and diluted up to 10 mL with saline in a sterile bottle. All procedure time was 53 min.
4.2.3. Method 2. HPLC purification of [18F]FMZ (line b in Fig. 1)
After radiofluorination the reaction mixture was cooled to 30 °C and neutralized by acidic water (7 mL, pH = 3.5) from (5) and passed through a C18 cartridge (SPE1). The cartridge was washed with water (4 mL, 6), the [18F]FMZ fraction was eluted with acetonitrile (1 mL, 7) and diluted with water (3 mL, tube 2) before HPLC purification. HPLC procedure was done at 5 mL/min using 0.01 M H3PO4/MeCN (4/1, v/v) as eluent. The radioactive peak of [18F]FMZ was collected at 16–21 min into flack for dilution with water (50 mL, 12). The final purification was achieved by passing the mixture through the C18 Plus cartridge (SPE2) followed washing with water (4 mL, 9) and eluting of product with 50% EtOH/H2O (1 mL, 10). Finally, the product was diluted with phosphate buffer pH = 3.5 (4 mL, 11) and sterilized by passing through a Millex GV into sterile bottle prefilled with 5 mL of saline. All process took 80 min.
