Abstract
Conductive ceramics are being developed to replace current Pt anodes in the electrolytic reduction of spent oxide fuels in pyroprocessing. While several conductive ceramics have shown promising electrochemical properties in small-scale experiments, their long-term stabilities have not yet been investigated. In this study, the chemical stability of conductive La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 in LiCl–Li2O molten salt at 650°C was investigated to examine its feasibility as an anode material. Dissolution of Sr at the anode surface led to structural collapse, thereby indicating that the lifetime of the La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 anode is limited. The dissolution rate of Sr is likely to be influenced by the local environment around Sr in the perovskite framework.

1. Introduction
The accumulation of spent oxide fuels used in nuclear power plants has become a global issue because of their long lifetime and radiotoxicity [1], [2]. However, spent oxide fuels have several reusable radioactive species such as U, Pu, and other transuranic elements that can be recovered. Pyroprocessing is being considered as a method to manage and recycle the spent oxide fuels [3], [4], [5]. Pyroprocessing includes several electrochemical processes, such as electrolytic reduction, electrorefining, and electrowinning [3]. The spent oxide fuels can be reduced to metallic states through electrolytic reduction. Metal oxides (e.g., UO2) are electrochemically dissociated into metals (e.g., U) at the cathode, and O2 gas at the anode, during electrolytic reduction using LiCl–Li2O molten salt at 650°C [6]. The metal products are then recovered using electrorefining and electrowinning processes for the fabrication of the metal fuels which could be used in next-generation sodium-cooled fast reactors [3], [4], [5].
Pt is the most commonly used anode material in electrolytic reduction because of its excellent electrochemical activity and superior oxidation resistance at high temperatures (approx. 650°C) [6], [7]. However, the Pt anode is gradually damaged during the electrolytic reduction in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt, owing to side reactions (e.g., Pt + 3O2− + 2Li+ = Li2PtO3 + 4e– or Pt = Pt2+ + 2e–) [6]. Additionally, Pt is one of the most expensive materials, thus alternative anode materials are needed for use in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt system [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].
Conductive ceramics are potential candidates for use as O2-evolving anode materials because of their stability in the presence of high-temperature O2 gas [8], [9], [10]. Recent studies have revealed that several conductive ceramics such as TiN, NixFeOy, and La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 can electrochemically reduce metal oxides to metals in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt at 650°C [8], [9], [10]. However, the TiN anode significantly degrades during electrolytic reduction owing to the formation of pores, indicating its poor stability [8]. It has been claimed that NixFeOy can be chemically transformed to NiO and Li(Ni, Fe)O2 at the surface (e.g., NiFe2O4 = NiO + 2LiFeO2) during electrolytic reduction, without degradation in its electrochemical performance [9]. No noticeable phase change or physical degradation was found in the La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 anode after a small-scale experiment [10]. However, the long-term stability of ceramic anodes is an important issue for the scale-up of the electrolytic reducer.
In this study, we investigated the chemical stability of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 to evaluate its long-term stability in the molten salt electrolyte. First, La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 was immersed into LiCl–Li2O molten salt under O2 bubbling for 7 days. Its structural changes and dissolution behavior was then examined. The chemical stabilities of SrRuO3 and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3, which have similar crystal structures and elements to La0.33Sr0.67MnO3, were also investigated for comparison.
2. Materials and methods
The chemical stability of sintered La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 (Toshima Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Japan) was evaluated using 300 g of LiCl–Li2O (1 wt.% of Li2O; Alfa Aesar, A Johnson Matthey Company, USA) molten salt at 650°C. Rectangular La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 (approx. 6 × 2.5 × 0.6 cm) was immersed into the molten salt (immersion depth: approx. 3 cm) and then stored for 7 days under continuous O2 bubbling (Fig. 1) to create an oxidative environment. The immersed La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 was rinsed with distilled water to remove any residual salt. X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker Corporation, D8 Advances, Germany) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Horiba, Ltd, X-MAX, Japan) coupled with scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, Ltd, SU-8010, Japan) were used to identify phase stability and atomic distribution before and after the immersion. Another immersion experiment was performed for 1 day (without O2 bubbling) to evaluate the cation (e.g., La, Sr, and Mn) dissolution behavior in the molten salt (3.9 g of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 in 300 g of LiCl–Li2O). Elemental analysis of the La0.33Sr0.67MnO3-immersed molten salt was performed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to examine the cation composition of LiCl–Li2O. Additional 1-day immersion tests were carried out on a sintered SrRuO3 (LTS Chemical Inc., USA) and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 powder (Kceracell, Co., Ltd, South Korea) for comparison.

3. Results and discussion
Figs. 2A and 2B show the mechanical instability of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt. The surface of the sintered La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 was destroyed after immersion in the molten salt for 7 days under O2 bubbling. To investigate the origin of this destruction (either thermal stress or chemical reaction), the chemical stability of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 before and after the immersion was examined with scanning electron microscopy-EDS and XRD (Figs. 2C and 2D). Surprisingly, no Sr was detected in several regions on the delaminated La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 samples (Fig. 2C), indicating that Sr was dissolved into the molten salt during the immersion. XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2D confirm the structural change of the La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 phase. This implies that the structural change induced by Sr dissolution is the dominant factor in the collapse of the La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 phase.

Pristine La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 possesses a well-known perovskite structure (Fig. 2D). However, it seems that the secondary phase (as indicated by the circle shown in Fig. 2D) appeared around the original peaks during the immersion, and the intensity of the secondary peaks became higher in the delaminated area, compared with that in the bulk area after the immersion. Hence, it is thought that the phase change is more favored near the surface, leading to the collapse of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 at the surface. The overall diffraction pattern of the secondary phase resembles that of the pristine materials, suggesting a similar crystal structure of the secondary phase to the original one. Hence, the secondary phase is believed to be the off-stoichiometric perovskite-like La–Mn–O phase (Sr-free/deficient). In addition, a third phase (as indicated by the reverse-triangle shown in Fig. 2D), whose peak position does not match that of the perovskite, can be seen after the immersion. This phase is likely to be MnO2 (PDF#42-1169), which can be formed owing to the presence of excess Mn compared with La.
The cation dissolution behavior of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 was quantitatively studied using ICP-AES, as summarized in Table 1. After a 1-day immersion (without O2 bubbling), 128 ppm of Sr were detected in the molten salt, while compositions of La and Mn were not less than the detection limit. This result agrees with the EDS analysis, demonstrating the dissolution behavior of Sr (Fig. 2C). The amount of dissolved Sr in LiCl–Li2O was approximately 0.038 g, while that in the pristine material was approximately 1.10 g (approx. 3.45% loss per day). Such a dissolution rate is likely to be problematic for long-term use of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 (simply, approx. 50% loss after 20 days).

For comparison, the dissolution behavior of a Sr-rich perovskite, SrRuO3, was studied. The sintered SrRuO3 was completely lost and a powdered product was obtained after the immersion, as shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. The XRD data depicted in Fig. 3C clearly shows that the SrRuO3 phase was eliminated during the immersion to form a metallic Ru phase. This means that the dissolution rate of Sr in SrRuO3 is much faster than that in La0.33Sr0.67MnO3. Therefore, the dissolution behavior of Sr is not solely affected by the Sr element itself, but is also strongly related to the local environment surrounding Sr.

The chemical stability of the Sr-free perovskite compound, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3, was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Despite the absence of Sr in the LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 structure, a more severe structural degradation occurred compared with that seen in La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 (Fig. 4). ICP-AES analysis showed that both Ni and Fe were soluble in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt, as shown in Table 1. La composition was less than the detection limit after the immersion, similar to La0.33Sr0.67MnO3, implying a high stability of La in LiCl–Li2O. It is interesting that the structural change of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 is more drastic than that of La0.33Sr0.67MnO3 in spite of the lesser amount of Ni/Fe dissolution. This probably occurred because LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 separated into Ni-rich (La2NiO4-like) and Fe-rich (LaFeO3-like) phases. It is thought that the perovskite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 phase cannot be stabilized, even with a small amount of cation dissolution.

4. Conclusion
Chemical stabilities of conductive ceramics (La0.33Sr0.67MnO3, SrRuO3, and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3) in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt were investigated to examine their feasibility as long-term stable anode materials in electrolytic reduction. Cation dissolution (e.g., Sr, Ni, and Fe) is a dominant factor affecting the chemical instability of these compounds. It seems that the dissolution rate of the cations varies depending on the local environment as well as the type of the elements. La and Mn remained stable in the perovskite structure in the LiCl–Li2O molten salt. Hence, the Sr-free/deficient La–Mn–O phase may be promising as a long-lasting anode material, but its electrical conductivity, electrochemical activity, and mechanical stability should be considered.
