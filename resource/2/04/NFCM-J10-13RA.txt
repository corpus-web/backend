Abstract
Zr:W:Si. The optimum gel was prepared using the molar ratio 1:1:7 at pH 8. The ZrSiW gel was investigated by FTIR, XRD, thermal analysis (TGA and DTA), FESEM, XRF, and NAA. Then, XRF and NAA techniques were used to estimate the proportion of the constituents of the gel according to the molecular formula [ZrO2(Si(WO4)2)16H2O]. 188W/188Re generator was prepared based on the selected ZrSi188W gel, which gives the highest tungsten content (393.3 mg W/g gel) with 75 ± 3% elution yield of 188Re. Quality control was studied on the 188Re to make sure its validity for clinical applications.
1. Introduction
Rhenium-188 (188Re, T1/2 = 16.9 h) is one of the most important radioisotopes. It is used for the radio-immunotherapy, palliation of skeletal bone pain and endovascular brachytherapy to prevent restenosis after angioplasty (Knapp, 1998, Hoher et al., 2000, Seitz et al., 1999, Murray et al., 2001, Wang et al., 1995, Howell et al., 1989). It is suitable for the radiotherapy as well as radiodiagnosis due to its emission of beta-particles (Emax = 2.12 MeV) and gamma-rays (Eγ = 155 keV, Iγ = 15%). In addition to its chemical behavior similar to technetium, it is an attractive radioisotope for in vivo applications (Deutsch et al., 1986).
The production of 188W (T1/2 = 69.4 d) as a parent of 188Re, was achieved by using double neutron capture on the natural tungsten, although it has a relatively low abundance of 186W (28.43%) but the thermal neutron capture cross-section (38 b) as well as the resonance integral (419 b) of the 186W(n,γ)187W reaction (Al-abyad and Mohamed, 2017, Elmaghraby, 2017). Similar behavior is attributed to the reaction 187W(n, γ)188W, which the thermal capture cross section and resonance integrated are found to be 64 and 2760 b, respectively (Mughabghab, 1984).
The most effective technique used for preparing the 188W/188Re generator faces a lot of challenges (Chakravarty et al., 2010, Novgorodov et al., 2000). The preparation of 188W/188Re generator was carried out depending on alumina column in 188W-tungstate form and 188Re was eluted from the column by saline (Mikheev et al., 1972, Knapp et al., 1994, Kamioki et al., 1994). The limited amount of tungsten absorbed onto conventional inorganic adsorbents (Ehrhardt et al., 1987, Kamioki et al., 1994) such as alumina (50 mg W/g) (Jeong et al., 2008). The alumina sulfate used as a column material for the 188W/188Re generator has a high sensitivity for the tungsten (450 mg/g) (Lee et al., 2009) however, the purification and concentration of 188Re required a complex system (Lee et al., 2006, 2007a, b, c). Gel generators based on matrices of zirconium or titanium-tungstate were developed and tested (Dadachov et al., 2002; Le Van So, 2003). Some exchangers have adsorbed tungsten with a high capacity, such as gel metal oxide composites, hydroxyapatites, and polymeric zirconium compounds (PZC), as well as new nano-materials, which employed in the preparation of 188W/188Re generators (Monroy-Guzman et al., 2009, Dadachov et al., 1994, Chakravarty et al., 2009, Chakravarty et al., 2011). The available yield is mostly low specific volume (activity/ml) consequently, it requires an additional concentration step for the elute 188Re, resulting a fairly complex system (Guhlke et al., 2000, Sarkar et al., 2009, Mansur et al., 2006, Mushtaq, 2004) that leading to chemical impurities, high dose rates, and low reliability. The automated systems for the concentration of 188Re eluate were developed at a high cost (Jackel et al., 2005, Luo et al., 2007).
The prepared matrix of zirconium silicotungstate (ZrSiW gel) has been reported in a previous work as a sorbent material for a preparing of the 113Sn/113 mIn generator (El-Said et al., 2018). This work concerned with the preparation of a chemical stable gel by using a simple and an inexpensive method with the highest content of tungsten in the prepared gel for using as a base material in the 188W/188Re radioisotope generator. Several factors affecting the preparation of ZrSiW gels were studied. In addition to the concentration of the constituent elements of the gel was determined by two different ways XRF and NAA to estimate the proportion of constituents in the prepared gel and then estimate the molecular formula of the ZrSiW. The prepared gel was checked as a base material for the 188W/188Re generator
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents
All used reagents are analytical grade. Double distilled water (DDW) used throughout this work. ZrOCl2·2H2O from Sigma- Aldrich, Na2WO4·2H2O and Na2SiO3 from Fluka WO3, ZrO2 and SiO2 from Merck were purchased.
2.2. Preparation and characterization of zirconium silicotungstate (ZrSiW)
Several factors affecting the preparation of zirconium silicotungstate gel such as the molar ratio of Zr:W:Si (1:1:7, 2:1:7, 2:1:4 and 4:1:13) at pH 5.5 and (1:2:1 and 1:1:7) at pH 8 were studied. The optimum conditions selected based on the tungsten content, the morphological structure and chemical stability of the ZrSiW gel.
The ZrSiW gel prepared by mixing 50 ml, 0.04 mol L−1 sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O) to 50 ml of 0.28 mol L−1 sodium silicate (Na2SiO3), then the tungstate/silicate mixture added dropwise into 50 ml of 0.04 mol L−1 warm solution of zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl2·8H2O, dissolved in 0.2 mol L−1 HCl) within 30 min at pH 8. The ZrSiW gel was investigated by different techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA and DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.
2.2.1. Molecular formula
2.2.1.1. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique
The complementary techniques to each other were used to estimate the molecular formula of ZrSiW gels. The XRF used to measure the proportions of gel constituents. The number of moles of each constituent element in the ZrSiW gel was calculated by dividing the element percentage by its mass number. Then, dividing the number of moles of each element on the least mole number to determine the molecular formula of the gel. The thermal analysis was used for determining the number of water molecules by applying the Alberti’s equation (Alberti and Torracca, 1968).
2.2.1.2. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) technique
The ZrSiW gel constituents were determined quantitatively and qualitatively by thermal neutron irradiation and the standard materials that contain known weights of the interesting elements as tungsten oxide (0.088 g), zirconium oxide (0.46 g) and silicon oxide (4.3 g) for W, Zr and Si, respectively. They were irradiated in the thermal irradiation sites at the Second Egyptian Research Reactor (ETRR-II) for 60, 300 and 600 Sec, respectively. The ZrSiW gel (0.88 g) irradiated at the same position for 600 Sec. The standard material measured under the same conditions of the gel sample (sample-to-detector distance and equivalent sample size). From a comparison of the net peak areas of the spectra of the standard material and ZrSiW gel, the mass of the interested element calculated as follows:
@(1)
-
m(unk) and m(st): mass of the interested element in the unknown gel and the standard material, gram
-
Np: net counts in the γ-ray peak of interest
-
tm: measurement time, Sec.
-
td: decay time (time elapsed from end of irradiation till the start of measurement), Sec.
The characteristic gamma-lines of 97Zr, 187W, and 31Si appear clearly without any interference. Standard materials contain 0.34, 0.07 and 2 g of zirconium, tungsten, and silicon, respectively. Table (1) shows the decay properties of 97Zr, 187W, and 31Si (Firestone and Shirley, 1996). Due to the low gamma intensity of 31Si (0.07%). Therefore, the detection of 31Si needs relatively long irradiation time (tirr = 600 Sec), measurement time (tm= 7200 and 600 Sec for the unknown gel and standard material, respectively), and short cooling time (td=1800 Sec).

2.3. Preparation of 188W/188Re generator
Natural tungsten oxide (WO3, with chemical purity ≤ 99.9) was used as a target material. The WO3 (0.56 g) was irradiated for 48 h in the water-cooled Egyptian Second Research Reactor (ETRR-2, 22 MW) with thermal neutron flux 1–5 × 1014 n cm−2 s−1, then cooled for 10 days to decay out the short-lived radioisotopes. The obtained activity of 188W was ∼5 mCi (∼185 MBq). The tungstate solution was prepared by dissolving the irradiated WO3 (0.56 g) in 10 ml, 5 M NaOH then diluted by adding 40 ml distilled water. The silicate solution prepared by dissolving 1.8 g Na2SiO3 in 50 ml water and poured the tungstate solution into the silicate solution at room temperature. The mixed solution was added dropwise to the warm solution of Zr(IV) (0.8 g of Zr OCl2·8H2O dissolved in 50 ml of 0.2 mol L−1 HCl) within 30 min on a magnetic stirrer. The white precipitate gel formed by adjusting the pH values from 12.8 to 8 by adding HCl. The gel material was left overnight for complete precipitation. The precipitate was washed with the distilled water and separated by centrifugation. The washing process was carried out several times and then the precipitate dried at 50 °C within 24 h.

2.3.2. Quality control on rhenium-188
2.3.2.1. Chemical stability
The ZrSiW gel (0.1 g) equilibrated with 10 ml different concentrations of HCl or NaOH for 24 h at room temperature. The concentration of Zr(IV), W(VI) and Si(IV) determined in the liquid phase after filtration of ZrSiW gel. The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for determining the concentration of the studied elements (Zr, W, and Si).
2.3.2.2. Radiochemical purity
The chemical species of 188Re detected in the eluate via the ascending paper chromatography technique using Whatman paper No.3 (15 cm length × 1 cm width) and acetone as a developer. The Rf (retardation factor) value was calculated according to:
@(3)
2.3.2.3. Radionuclidic purity and chemical purity of 188Re
The radionuclides were immediately identified and latterly at least 15-day of elution by using the HPGe detector, for evaluation of 185,188W breakthrough. The eluate contents were determined by gamma spectrometry from the intensity of the 155 keV γ-ray of 188Re. Direct detection of 185W in the presence of 188Re is difficult, it emitted only gamma-line (Eγ = 125 keV) with very low intensity 0.019%, thus making it hard to be observed under the Compton background of 188Re (Eγ = 155 keV) with relatively high intensity 15%. The chemical properties of 185W and 188W are identical, so 188W used to determine the breakthrough. The Zr(IV), W(VI) and Si(IV) elements measured in the eluate by using ICP-AES after making sure the decay out the rhenium-188.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. FTIR studies on ZrSiW gel
Fig. 1, shows experimental FTIR spectrum for the ZrSiW gel. The broadband in the region 400–600 cm-1 could be related to the presence of different metal oxides Si-O, W-O and Zr-O. A maximum band appears at 456 cm-1 related to the rocking of the Si-O-Si bridges (Astorino et al., 1995). The absorption band of wavenumber range 900–1200 cm-1 refers to W=O and the existence vibration of W-Oc-W (oxygen center) appears at wavenumber 1060 cm-1 (Misono et al., 2001). The band of 1402 cm-1 may be attributed to the deformation, as a result of the vibration of metal hydroxyl groups (Sharma and Sharma, 2013). The band of 2330 cm-1 may be related to CO2 absorbed from the environment (Walker et al., 2004, Knurr and Weber, 2013). A broad absorption band evaluated due to the acidic groups of Si-OH, Zr-OH, and W-OH, which are observed at 1638 cm-1 (Srivastava et al., 1977, Moffat, 2002). There was a wide stretching vibration of O-H from H2O appeared of wavenumber 3446 cm-1.

3.2. TG and DTA studies on ZrSiW gel
Fig. 2, shows thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) for altering the mass of ZrSiW with increasing temperature in several stages. The first stage of the TG curve ranged 40–200°C, which gave a weight loss about 31.85%, may attribute to the removal of adsorbed moisture, lattice water and elimination of the hydroxyl group. The DTA scan showed an endothermic peak of range 40–200 °C. The second stage clarified a broad endothermic peak at a weight loss about 18.6% at 270 , which may attribute to the loss of SiO2 (Sameshima et al., 1994). The weight was decomposed at 500 °C may be attributed to the loss of ZrO2 (Monroy-Guzman et al., 2003). A weight loss (4.6%) was observed on the TG curve in the range 500–850 °C associated with a small exothermic peak at 625°C in the DTA curve. The presence of lattice water with a suitable amount of the gel material facilitates the eluent diffusion (Davarpanah et al., 2009).

3.3. XRD analysis on ZrSiW gel
Fig. 3, shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried ZrSiW gel that reveals its amorphous structure. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystal structure; due to a diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material is more spread than in case of a crystalline form, which leads to increasing the elution yield. On the other hand, the amorphous structure is more resistant to dissolution that leads to the high purity of 188Re eluates (Monroy-Guzman et al., 2008). The peak appearance at 34° may be attributed to several reasons such as impurity or the presence of a solid solution phase (crystal form) or a super-lattice phase (Waseda et al., 2011).

3.4. FESEM analysis
Fig. 4, shows the morphology structure of ZrSiW gel by using Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The micrographs reveal the hybrid material forms an irregular jelly tangle. There are many switchbacks, which allow the eluent pass through them.

3.5. X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF)
XRF was used for estimating the percentages of Zr, W, and Si in the prepared gel. Table (2) clarifies the tungsten is the highest content followed by zirconium and silicon (66%, 17% and 5%, respectively), as in Fig. 5, which obtained at pH 8 and molar ratio 1:1:7 of Zr:W:Si. The number of moles calculated and found to be 0.185, 0.359 and 0.179, respectively, that easily assessed the molar ratio of Zr:W:Si (1:2:1) in the ZrSiW gel by dividing each number of moles on the least value of mole (0.179). The molecular formula suggested as [ZrO2(Si(WO4)2)·nH2O]. TGA curve showed the ZrSiW gel lost about 31.85% of its weight at 200 °C, due to removing the number of water molecules (nH2O). Alberti's equation used to determine the number of water molecules in the ZrSiW gel (Alberti and Torracca, 1968).

3.6. Neutron activation analysis (NAA)
The ZrSiW gel (0.88 g) was irradiated by thermal neutrons for 600 Sec to detect the different radionuclides (97Zr, 187W, and 31Si) that have half-lives relatively long (hours) and is directly measured to detect these radionuclides as shown in Fig. 6(d). The gamma-peaks were selected based on a high resolution and free from any interference. Two gamma lines 479.5 and 685.8 keV were used to detect tungsten, then 743.4 and 1266 keV for zirconium and silicon, respectively. The Fig. 6(a, b and c) shows gamma analysis for known weights of WO3, ZrO2, and SiO2 as standard materials. The masses of elements were evaluated in ZrSiW gel by measuring the irradiated ZrSiW gel and standard materials on the HPGe detector then the obtained data were applied in the Eq. (1) as shown in Table (3). The results confirm the molar ratio 1:2:1 of Zr:W:Si by XRF method. The total mass of Zr, W, and Si in the irradiated gel estimated about 0.598 g. This value represents about 68% of the irradiated ZrSiW weight (0.88 g). The remaining percentage (32%) may be attributed to the percentage of water. This value is compatible with that obtained by thermal analysis.

3.7. Chemical stability
The stability of ZrSiW against HCl and NaOH concentrations up to 2 and 0.5 M, respectively. Table (4) shows the negligible amounts of Zr, W and Si ions detected by using ICP-AES. According to Pauling's rules for crystal structures the ratio of the ionic radius of the cation to the ionic radius of the anion in a cation-anion compound that gives simply by rC/rA. The W-O and Re-O in tungstate (WO4)2- and perrhenate (ReO4-) ions have the ionic radius 0.65, 1.32 and 0.55°A for W6+, O2- and Re7+, respectively. There is a relation between the radius ratio and coordination number. In a tungstate, the ratio of  is equal to 0.5, which located in the octahedral range (0.41–0.73) (Dadachov and Howe, 1999). In the perrhenate, the ratio of  is equal to 0.4, which located in the tetrahedral range (0.23–0.41). Therefore, the parent W6+ is more stable in the prepared gel than its daughter Re7+ that easily removed by a slight polar solvent. The suggested structure of ZrSiW gel clarified in structure (1).

3.8. 188W precipitation yield and 188Re elution yield
The relationship between the precipitation and elution yields were studied using different molar ratios of Zr:W:Si (1:1:7), (2:1:4) and (4:1:13) at a constant pH (pH 8), as shown in Fig. 7. This relationship also studied at the molar ratio 1:1:7 at different pHs (pH 5.5, 8 and 13), as shown in Fig. 8. The maximum precipitation yield of 188W (100 ± 0.18%) that gives the highest tungsten content (393.3 mg W/g gel) according to molecular formula [ZrO2(Si(WO4)2)·16H2O]. The maximum elution yield of 188Re (75 ± 3%) obtained by using the molar ratio (1:1:7) at pH 8.

3.9. Performance and quality control of 188W/188Re radioisotope generator
Fig. 9, clarified the elution curve of 188Re, which concentrated sharply (> 90%) in the first 4 ml saline solution (0.9% NaCl solution). The prepared generator points to the 188Re elution yield (75 ± 3%), 188W breakthrough (10-3± 2 × 10-4%). The elution of 188Re from the column was carried out 38 times within about six months. The time between two successive elution is ∼5 days.

Ascending paper chromatography technique was applied using Whatmann No.3 paper chromatography and acetone as a developer to exam the radiochemical purity of 188Re eluate. A single peak was obtained at the Rf value ~1 corresponding to 188ReO4- with the radiochemical purity (area under Rf peak) 98 ± 0.06% as shown in Fig. 10.

Structure (1). The suggested ZrSiW structure.
Gamma-ray spectrometry and radioactive decay measurements were done using a multichannel analyzer and NaI (Tl) scintillation counter were used to verify the radionuclidic purity of the eluate that has a half-life ~17 h corresponding to 188Re with 99.99 ± 1 × 10-3%. On the other hand, the 185W (T1/2 = 75 d, Eβ- = 0.433 MeV) is a product of 184W (n, γ)185W nuclear reaction (isotopic abundance of 184W = 30.7%). The high radioactivity and long half-life of 185W causes the biggest problem in the preparation of 188W/188Re generators by using natural tungsten as a target material. Therefore, rigorous separation is required to obtain 188Re eluate essentially free from not only 188W parent isotope but also from 185W. The 185W trapped on ZrSiW clean-up column per elution and none detected in the 188Re eluate.
Zr, W and Si levels in the 188Re eluate were found to be 0.03, 0.49 and 0.2 mg/L, respectively. The obtained values are below the permissible limit (British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), 2008).
4. Conclusion
A Series of ZrSiW gel was prepared by the precipitation method, using the molar ratio 1:1:7 of Zr:W:Si and pH 8, which gave the highest tungsten content (66%) with thermally and chemically stable gel. The constituents of ZrSiW gel were determined using NAA and XRF techniques. The data agree with both of the two techniques. The molar ratio evaluated and found to be 1:2:1 for Zr:W:Si. The number of water molecules was found to be 16 molecules per mole. Accordingly, the molecular formula of ZrSiW gel appointed [ZrO2(Si(WO4)2)·16H2O], which has the highest tungsten content (393.3 mg W/g gel). A saline solution was employed successfully for the elution of 188Re with a suitable elution yield, a concentrated solution of 188ReO4− with a high purity of radionuclidic and radiochemical (99.99 and 98%, respectively).
