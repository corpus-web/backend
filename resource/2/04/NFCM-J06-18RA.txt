Abstract
To separate Mo(VI) from high-level liquid waste, a silica-based (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P adsorbent was synthesized by impregnating an anti-isomer of 5,8-dietyl-7-hydroxy-6-dodecanonoxime (DEHDO) as a hydroxyoxime-type extractant and a molecule modifier of 1-dodecanol into a SiO2-P support, where “P” indicates the polymerized styrene–divinylbenzene inside macroporous SiO2 particles. Adsorption and separation behaviors of Mo(VI) in HNO3 solutions onto the adsorbent were investigated by batch and column methods, respectively. The adsorbent can effectively adsorb Mo(VI) in both methods. In addition, Pd(II) and Zr(IV) contained in the simulated high-level liquid waste were successfully isolated by the adsorbent packed column, respectively.
Introduction
To ensure a sustainable utilization of nuclear fuel resources in the future, it is necessary to recover U and Pu from the spent fuel by PUREX reprocessing. The process, however, emits high-level liquid waste (HLLW) that contains various fission products and minor actinides. Vitrification of HLLW and geological repository of the vitrified HLLW are suggested as the final disposal of the nuclear waste in several countries [1]. In the vitrification of HLLW in Japan, the concentration of Mo (~ 4.5 kg/1tHU, 45 GWd/t) in the vitrified HLLW is limited less than 3 wt% to prevent the decrease in mechanical properties of the glass, because the concentrated Mo formes yellow solid (MoO3) phases [2]. On the other hands, the nuclide partitioning of HLLW as well as the optimal disposal and/or recycling of the partitioned nuclide are thought to be a favorable way to minimize the radioactive waste accumulation and the long-term radiological risk [1, 2]. Therefore, the selective separation of Mo from HLLW can reduce of the radioactive waste and preserve the homogeneity of the vitrified HLLW. In addition, the handleability of HLLW is thought to be improved by the separation, because Mo(VI) in HLLW partially tends to precipitate [3].
Many methods for the separation of Mo(VI) are studied, including iron oxide adsorbent [4] and solvent extraction [5,6,7]. Among them, LIX63, which is 5,8-dietyl-7-hydroxy-6-dodecanonoxime (DEHDO) containing commercially available solvent extraction reagents, contains hybrid microcapsule adsorbents [8]. DEHDO is considered as one of the excellent extractants for Mo(VI), because such environment friendly molecule consisting of C, H, O, N atoms can extract Mo(VI) from acidic solutions. On the other hand, our group developed a partitioning process for HLLW based on an extraction chromatography method using five kinds of macroporous silica based adsorbents [9]. Compared with the aforementioned separation methods, the extraction chromatography that uses solid state adsorbents impregnated with a highly selective extractant has many advantages, such as selective separation, minimum use of organic diluents, compact equipment, easy phase separation, and low waste accumulation. Especially, a macroporous silica/polymer composite support (SiO2-P), where “P” indicates the polymerized styrene–divinylbenzene (SDB) inside macroporous SiO2 particles, has higher resistance to acid and radiation degradation compared with organic resins [10]. In the process, Mo(VI) was separated as one of the non-adsorbates on the N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-3-oxapentane-1,5-diamide (TODGA) impregnated adsorbent. Therefore, the development of the macroporous silica-based adsorbent impregnated with DEHDO is considered to provide an excellent adsorbent for Mo(VI) and improve our process.
For the purpose, (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P and (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P were synthesized by impregnation of DEHDO as the extractant and 1-dodecanol (Dodec) as a molecular modifier into the SiO2-P support. In (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P, the purchased LIX63 was used as DEHDO without further purification for simplification of preparation. In contrast, the anti-isomer of DEHDO (anti-DEHDO) was used in (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P for thr effective adsorption of Mo(VI), because the syn-isomer of DEHDO is inactive due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding [11]. Adsorption and separation behaviors of Mo(VI) in HNO3 solutions onto the adsorbents were investigated by batch and column methods, respectively.
Experimental
Materials
The extraction reagent LIX63 containing 5,8-dietyl-7-hydroxy-6-dodecanonoxime was purchased from BASF Ltd., and the molecular modifier of 1-dodecanol was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. The molecular structures of DEHDO (anti-isomer) and Dodec are illustrated in Fig. 1. (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O, Re2O7, and other metallic nitrates such as Sr(NO3)2, Ba(NO3)2, and RE(NO3)3·6H2O (RE = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) were supplied by Kanto Chemical Co. The ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate solution, rhodium nitrate solution, and palladium nitrate solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. The solutions of metal ions were prepared by adding metal reagents to HNO3 and distilled water into achieve the desired concentrations.

Preparation of adsorbents
The macroporous silica-based (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P adsorbent was prepared by fixing LIX63 and Dodec into the SiO2-P support based on the impregnation method [9, 10]. Specifically, the impregnated organic compounds into the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P were syn- and anti-isomers of DEHDO, kerosene and Dodec. On the other hand, the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P adsorbent was prepared by fixing the anti-DEHDO, which was separated from syn-isomer, as well as kerosene and Dodec into the SiO2-P. According to the literature [11], the anti-DEHDO was active in extracting metal ions but the syn form was inactive due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the anti-DEHDO was obtained by the separation procedure using a nickel sulfate solution as described in the literature [11]. The obtained anti-DEHDO was checked by comparring its infrared transmission spectrum (Shimadzu, IR Affnity-1) with the reported Infrared-active bands and assignments [11]. The compositions of the adsorbents under the preparation conditions are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1 Compositions of the prepared adsorbents (preparation conditions)
Batch adsorption behavior
The adsorption behaviors of the adsorbents were investigated by the batch method. The dry adsorbent (0.20 g) and the test solution (4 cm3) in a glass vial were shaken by a thermostatic shaking bath at 298 K for 5 h. After shaking, the concentrations of metal ions in the separated liquid phase using a 0.20 micron filter from the solid phase were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (Shimadzu, ICPE-9000). From the results, uptake ratio (R, %), distribution coefficient (Kd, cm3/g) and adsorbed amount (Q, mmol/g) were calculated as follows
R=C0−CtC0×100,
(1)
Kd=C0−CeCe×Vm,
(2)
Q=C0−CtVC0
(3)
where C0, Ct, and Ce are concentrations of metal ions in the liquid phase (mM) (M = mol/dm3) at the initial state, certain time and equilibrium state, respectively. m and V are the weight of the dry adsorbent in g and the solution volume in cm3, respectively.
Chromatographic separation behavior
The separation behavior of metal ions by the adsorbent was examined by the column method. Dry adsorbent (4.0 g) was packed in a glass column using distilled water. The temperature of the column was controlled by the circulating thermostatic water through the column jacket. After conditioning using a 2 M HNO3 solution, 5 cm3 of the simulated HLLW was added into the column by pumping. The washing solution and eluent were subsequently supplied. The concentrations of metal ions in the effluent were also analyzed by ICP-AES.
Results and discussion
Adsorption selectivity of metal ions
To study adsorption selectivities of metal ions onto the DEHDO loaded adsorbents, the batch adsorption experiments were carried out using the simulated HLLW containing 26 elements and 2 M HNO3 with 5 h shaking time at 298 K. The initial concentrations of the constituents in the solution are summarized in Table 2.
Table 2 Composition of the simulated HLLW solution containing 26 elements
The calculated uptake ratios of the elements are shown in Fig. 2. Both adsorbents indicated the adsorption affinities for Pd(II) and Mo(VI). The selectivity of Pd(II) was higher than that of Mo(VI). The separation of Pd(II) and/or Mo(VI) from acidic solutions using a hydroxy oxime-type extractant were reported in the literatures [5,6,7,8, 12,13,14]. The Pd(II)-N and Mo(VI)-OH coordintion were considered in the litaratures [14,15,16,17]. Besides, in soft-hard acid–base (HSAB) principle, soft Pd(II) and hard Mo(VI) have affinities for soft N and hard OH ligands, respectively. In addition, the extractions of Pd(II), Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) from HNO3 solutions were reprted [6]. Therefore, it is considered that the DEHDO-laded adsorbents have adsorption selectivities for Mo(VI), Pd(II) and Zr(IV), expressed by the same mechanism in the solvent extraction using hydroxy oxime. However, the adsorption of Mo(VI) onto the adsorbents in HNO3 solutions was certainly intercepted by Pd(II). The basis of the selectivity should be clarified in the future.

On the other hand, the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P recorded high uptake ratios of Mo(VI) and Pd(II) than the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P and littele uptake ratio of Zr(IV), although the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P also showed adsorption affinity for Zr(IV), which is similar to the reported result of the extraction study. The difference between the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P and the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P was thought to be caused by the abundance of syn-DEHDO. Assuming the syn-DEHDO as a ligand having affinity for Zr(IV) and non-affinity for Mo(VI) and Pd(II), the adsorptions of Mo(VI) and Pd(II) would be increased by the loaded anti-DEHDO instead of removed syn-DEHDO. In addition, the adsorption of Zr(IV) would be decreased by removing the syn-DEHDO. Therefore, (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P without syn-DEHDO was considered to be favorable for separatiing of Mo(VI).
Effects of HNO3 concentration
The adsorption affinities of DEHDO-loaded adsorbents for Mo(VI), Pd(II) and Zr(IV) were confirmed. In addition, oxoanionic Re in substitution of radioactive Tc was considered to be an adsorbate from the literature [5].
The adsorptions of the tested Mo(VI), Pd(II), Zr(IV) and Re(VII) toward the adsorbents in HNO3 solutions having different concentrations were investigated at 298 K. Firstly, the experiments were carried out using solutions containing Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Re(VII) to emphasize the adsorption behavior of Mo(VI) by excluding Pd(II) which interfered with the adsorption of Mo(VI). Figure 3a, b present the distribution coefficients of each metal ions as a function of the initial HNO3 concentration from 0.5 to 6 M. It was found that the difference of the initial HNO3 concentrations had little influence on the adsorption of Mo(VI) onto the adsorbents in this condition. The trend was similar to the reported result in solvent extraction [6]. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the adsorption reaction was not explained clearly, because Mo(VI) in aqueous solution can be various chemical species [18,19,20]. However, Mo(VI) was considered to be separated from Zr(VI) and Re(VII) in the solutions containing over 1 M HNO3 using the adsorbents.

In addition, the total organic carbon (TOC) in the liquid phase before and after the adsorption were analyzed by a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu, TOC-VCPN) to investigate the chemical stability of the adsorbents. The results are also illustrated in Fig. 3a, b. The comparison between Fig. 3b with Fig. 3a indicates that the leaked TOC from the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P was larger than that from the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P. The amount of the leaked TOC from the (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P increased by increasing HNO3 concertations. Therefore, the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P was studied in the following experiments as a favorable DEHDO-loaded adsorbent.
Moreover, the effect of HNO3 concentration on the adsorptions of Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Re(VII) with Pd(II) onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P were also investigated. Figure 4 shows the distribution coefficients of the metal ions as a function of the initial HNO3 concentration from 0.5 to 6 M. In the solutions, Pd(II) adsorbed onto the adsorbent with a higher affinity than Mo(VI). The Kd of Mo(VI) was smaller than that obtained using the solution without Pd(II). From the results, it is confirmed that Pd(II) interfered with the adsorption of Mo(VI) onto the adsorbent. In addition, the adsorption of Zr(IV) and Re(VII) were also decreased via the Pd(II) adsorption.

Effects of contact time
The effects of contact time on the adsorptions of Mo(VI), Pd(II), Zr(IV) and Re(VII) onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P were examined in 2 M HNO3 solution at 298 K. Similar to the previous section, the adsorption of Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Re(VII) were firstly examined, and the obtained uptake ratios are displayed in Fig. 5 as a function of contact time. Subsequently, Fig. 6 indicates the uptake ratios obtained using solutions containing Pd(II). It is shown that the adsorption of Mo(VI) onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P reached the equilibrium state within 10 min regardless of Pd(II). The adsorption of Pd(II) onto the adsorbent was also considerably fast and the uptake ratio was > 99%. The competitive adsorption of Pd(II) and Mo(VI) was considered to occur within a short period of time. In addition, it is thought that the adsorbed Pd(II) and Mo(VI) did not exchanged with each other because the uptake ratios were constant.

Without Pd(II), the adsorption of Zr(IV) reached the equilibrium within 1 h. However, using the solution containing Pd(II), the increase of Zr(VI) uptake with increasing contact time was changed to reduction after 1 h. It was anticipated that the discharge of the adsorbed Zr(IV) was caused by re-formation of Pd(II) complex in the solid phase, e.g., Pd(II) bonded to one anti-DEHDO molecule connected to the second anti-DEHDO. In the adsorption of Re(VII), the same trend of Zr(IV) was observed and the same reason was considered.
Adsorption isotherm
The adsorption isotherms of metal ions onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P were investigated using 2 M HNO3 solution containing Mo(VI), Zr(IV), Re(VII) and Pd(II), respectively. The temperature was 298 K and the contact time was 5 h. The obtained isotherms of are shown in Fig. 7 by plotting the adsorbed amount of the tested ions versus the equilibrium concentration of the metal ions in liquid phase.

The isotherms were analyzed by three basically theoretical isotherm models, including the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models [9].

(8)
LnQe=LnQmax=βε(Linearform)
(9)
ε=RTLn(1+1Ce)
(10)
E=12β−−√
(11)
where Qe and Qmax are the adsorbed amount (mmol/g) at the equilibrium state and the maximum adsorbed amount, respectively. KL, 1/nf, KF, and β are the Langmuir constant (L/mmol), the Freundlich isotherm exponent constant related to the adsorption intensity, the Freundlich constant (mmol/g), and the Dubinin-Radushkevich constant (mol2/kJ2), respectively. R, T, and E represent the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), the absolute temperature (K), and the mean adsorption energy (kJ/mol). KL and Qmax can be calculated from the intercept and the slope of the plot of Ce/Qe vs Ce, respectively. Besides, KF and 1/nf were calculated from that of the plot of Log Qe vs Log Ce. β and Qmax were obtained from the plot of Ln Qe vs ε2, respectively. These obtained parameters are summarized in Table 3.
Table 3 Calculated parameters
From the analysis, the linearity with R2 of 1.0 supported that the adsorptions of Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Pd(II) onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P apparently fit the Langmuir isotherm model, and the adsorption of Re(VII) apparently fit the Freundlich or Dubinin-Radushkevich model.
The static adsorption capacities of Mo(VI), Zr(IV), Re(VII), and Pd(II) were calculated to be 0.46, 0.18, 0.7, and 0.46 mmol/g by the analysis. The capacities of Mo(VI) and Pd(II) were similar to the half value of the impregnated amount of anti-DEHDO. From the fact, Mo(VI) and Pd(II) were estimated to be bonded to two anti-DEHDO molecules in the equilibrium adsorption state at 298 K.
Separation behavior
To understand the separation behavior of Mo(VI) using the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P in the column method, the adsorbent packed column was examined at 298 K using the simulated HLLW, i.e., a 2 M HNO3 solution containing Mo(VI), Zr(IV), Ru(III), Rh(III), Pd(II), Re(VII), La(III), Ce(III), Nd(III), Sm(III) and Gd(III).
Firstly, the separation profiles of these metal ions excepting Pd(II) are obtained in Fig. 8 using the Pd(II)-free simulated HLLW, because Pd(II) obstructed the adsorption of Mo(VI) onto the adsorbent. After feeding the Pd(II)-free simulated HLLW, Ru(III), Rh(III), and the trivalent lanthanides immediately passed the column. And then, weakly adsorbed Re(VII) was eluted by a 2 M HNO3 washing solution. Subsequently, the supplied Zr(IV) was efficiently recovered by 0.5 M oxalic acid solution (> 98%). However, the adsorbed Mo(VI) cannot be eluted by oxalic acid and 1 M HNO3 solution containing 0.5 M 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone oxime (HMBO) which is water-soluble hydroxyl oxime. In the case of solvent extraction, the extracted Mo(VI) by DEHDO was effectively stripped by a basic aqueous solution. But in case of a silica-based adsorbent, usage of a basic solution should be forbidden because SiO2 was dissolved by the alkaline solution. So, we have to find out the acidic or neutral eluent solution to recover the adsorbed Mo(VI). At this stage, the adsorbent was evaluated as one of the effective Mo(VI) removers from HNO3 solutions.

Inside dimension: Φ10 × h150 mm, Adsorbent: 4 g (dry weight), Bed height: 8 cm, Flow rate: 0.5 cm3/min, Temperature: 298 K. Feed: 5 mL simulated HLLW (Metal ion: Mo(VI), Zr(IV), Ru(III), Rh(III), Re(VII), La(III), Ce(III), Nd(III), Sm(III), and Gd(III), [Meals]: 5.0 mM, (HNO3): 2.0 M). Washing liquid: 30 mL HNO3 solution [(HNO3): 2.0 M]. Eluent 1: 30 mL oxalic acid solution [(oxalic acid): 0.50 M]. Eluent 2: 60 mL HMBO-HNO3 solution [(HMBO): 0.50 M, (HNO3): 1.0 M]
Next, the separation of the simulated HLLW containing Pd(II) was carried out using the same method. The obtained separation curves are illustrated in Fig. 9. The concerned intercept of the adsorptions of Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) by Pd(II) was not observed. The similar profiles of Mo(VI), Zr(IV) Ru(III), Rh(III), Re(VII) and the trivalent lanthanides were observed in the experimental conditions. The reason is considered that enough amount of adsorption sites for Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) remained in the column although all the supplied Pd(II) adsorbed on the bed. Moreover, the adsorbed Pd(II) was effectively eluted by 0.1 M thiourea (Tu)-0.1 M HNO3 solution. The recovery ratios of Pd(II) and Zr(IV) were estimated to be 92% and 97%, respectively. Then, 4% of Pd(II) and 3% of Zr(IV) were fortunately eluted by the HMBO-HNO3 solution. Therefore, the adsorbent is considered to be one of the most effective adsorbents for chromatographic separation and recovery of Pd(II) and Zr(IV) from HNO3 solutions.

Conclusions
To separate Mo(VI) from HLLW, silica-based (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P and (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P adsorbents were synthesized by impregnating the DEHDO extractant and the molecule modifier of Dodec into the SiO2-P support.
The adsorption behaviors were investigated by the batch method. The adsorbents showed selective adsorption affinities for Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Pd(II) in HNO3 solutions. The adsorption of Mo(VI) and Pd(II) reached the equilibrium state within 10 min. However, (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P was considered to be more favorable than (DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P due to its chemical stability. It was evaluated that the adsorptions of Mo(VI), Zr(IV), and Pd(II) onto the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P apparently fit the Langmuir isotherm model and the adsorption of Re(VII) apparently fit the Freundlich or Dubinin-Radushkevich model.
The separation behaviors of the simulated HLLW were examined using the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P packed column. The adsorbent can effectively adsorb Mo(VI), Zr(IV) and Pd(II) from the 2 M HNO3 solutions. The concerned interference with the adsorptions of Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) by Pd(II) was not observed under the condition because enough amount of active adsorption sites have remained after the adsorption of Pd(II). In addition, Pd(II) and Zr(IV) were successfully recovered by solutions containing thiourea and oxalic acid, respectively.
From these results, the (anti-DEHDO + Dodec)/SiO2-P was evaluated as one of the effective Mo(VI) remover from HNO3 solutions and one of the most effective adsorbents for isolating Pd(II) and Zr(IV) in HLLW from other metal ions. An effective eluent must be found out to recover the adsorbed Mo(VI) and to reuse the column, and a radiation stability must be evaluated. There is a possibility to apply the adsorbent for the separation of Mo(VI) from real HLLW.
