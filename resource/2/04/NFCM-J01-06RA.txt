Abstract
In the paper, Brandon mathematical model that describes the relationship between the essential fabrication parameters [reduction temperature (TR), calcination temperature (TC), calcination time (tC) and reduction time (tR)] and specific surface area of ammonium diuranate (ADU)-derived UO2 powder products was established. The proposed models can be used to predict and control the specific surface area of UO2 powders prepared through ADU route. Suitable temperatures for conversion of ADU and ammonium uranyl carbonate (AUC) was examined with the proposed model through assessment of the sinterability of UO2 powders.

1. Introduction
The manufacture of the UO2 nuclear fuel pellets includes the conversion of UF6 into UO2 powder and the fabrication of UO2 pellets from such UO2 powder [1], [2], [3]. About the conversion of UF6 into UO2 powder, many dry and wet conversion methods have been developed [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In a former wet conversion, UF6 was hydrolyzed in water to form uranyl fluoride – fluoride acid (UO2F2-HF) solution. Subsequently, the solution was precipitated through either an ammonium diuranate (ADU) route or an ammonium uranyl carbonate (AUC) route. These ADU and/or AUC powders are then calcinated and reduced into UO2 powders [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The ADU-derived uranium oxide powder (or ex-ADU uranium oxide powder) possesses some characteristics different from the AUC-derived uranium oxide powder (or ex-AUC uranium oxide powder), such as particle size and flowability [7], [8], [9]. The flowability and the particle size of the ex-AUC uranium oxide powder are better than those of the ex-ADU uranium oxide powder, so press feed preparation stage (pre-pressing and granulation) might be omitted for UO2 ceramic pellet prepared from the AUC route [1], [7], [8], [9]. Meanwhile, in general, ex-ADU uranium oxide powder is fine and non-spherical with moderate specific surface area (SSA), having high sintering reactivity but difficulty in pressing. Thus, such powder has to be granulated in order to increase its flowability so that the pellet length can easily be controlled during pressing [1], [7], [8], [9].
Chemical reactions for ADU formation from uranyl solution, in particular, are as below [6]:
(1)2UO2F2 + 6NH4OH = (NH4)2U2O7 + 4NH4F + 3H2O
(2)2UO2F2 + 6NH3(gas) + 3H2O = (NH4)2U2O7 + 4NH4F
The ADU intermediate products are often contaminated with fluoride (F) ions. So, the preparation of UO2 powder via ADU route includes two sequential steps including the calcination of ADU precipitate into U3O8 powder with coincident F elimination and the reduction of the U3O8 into UO2 ceramic powder [10], [11]. These two steps are essential in the UO2 pellet fabrication.
The parameters of the UO2 preparation strongly affect the final characteristics of UO2 powder and, therefore, have an effect on UO2 pelletizing [6], [7], [8], [9]. Specific surface area (SSA) of the UO2 powder is one of the most important characteristics affecting the activity and the correspondence of the powder during UO2 ceramic pellet fabrication. The SSA is a function of grain size, aggregation and agglomeration, morphology and structure of the powder [6], [7], [8], [9]. Therefore, SSA is considered as the most important feature to assess sinterability of the UO2 powder. In the previous report, we built a mathematical model to describe the relationship between its SSA and the process parameters for the calcination and reduction for the UO2 powder prepared through AUC [14]. The proposed model has been well applied for predicting a basic characteristic of nuclear fuel ceramic powder as well as for controlling the lab-scale production of the powder in our lab. In the paper, we establish a new mathematical model to describe the relationship between SSA of ex-ADU uranium oxide powder and the process parameters of the calcination and reduction that were employed for the powder fabrication. In addition, the sinterability of uranium oxide powders prepared by both ADU and AUC was tested and compared.
2. Experimental section
The ADU powder was precipitated by the reaction of ammonium liquid with a solution containing uranyl fluoride (UO2F2) and fluoride acid (HF) with U:F molar ratio of 1:6. The solution is composed of the same constituents (UO2F2 and HF) and their molar ratio as the product of the UF6 hydrolyzing process. Analytical grade nitrogen and hydrogen were used as pure gases during calcination and reduction.
The calcination of ADU into U3O8 and the reduction of the U3O8 into UO2 powder were carried out in an apparatus consisting of a rotary tube furnace 1300 °C (Nabertherm, Germany) and hydrogen-nitrogen-steam supply system. The calcination was carried out over a range of time and temperatures in an atmosphere of nitrogen and steam (1:1 in molar ratio). After the calcination finished, the subsequent reduction was carried out in a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen and nitrogen gases (3:1 in molar ratio). The final product was UO2 powder. The specific surface area (SSA) of the obtained UO2 powder was measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Coulter SA 3100, USA).
Sinterability of the UO2 powders was tested by density of UO2 pellets prepared from the UO2 powder samples in various conversion temperatures. Compacting of green pellets was performed with a die of 11.3 mm in diameter by using a hydraulic single acting press (Carver, USA) and pressing at 350 MPa, lubricating on die surface with a mixture of zinc stearate and acetone. Sintering was performed in a high temperature furnace (Nabertherm, Germany) with a molybdenum heating sheet. A flow of high-purity hydrogen gas was used for a reducing atmosphere in sintering. Fig. 1 shows a photo of the sintering furnace. Sintered pellet density was determined by Hydrostatic (or Archimed) method. The resintering test was carried out to determine the thermal stability of the fuel pellets, the sintered pellets were placed into the sintering furnace and held down in the reducing medium (Ar + 7% H2) for 24 h at the temperature of 1700 ± 50 °C. The thermal stability of the fuel pellets is estimated through the change of the average pellet diameter before and after testing or by the change of pellet density.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Multiple regression analysis for the establishment of Brandon equation
In order to master preparing the UO2 powders whose properties are appropriate to the UO2 ceramic pellet fabrication and on the basis of experimental data that describe the effects of process conditions on SSA of UO2 powder, a statistical modeling method using Brandon multiple regression model is used [12], [13], [14]. Our experimental data also indicated that four parameters (factors) affecting SSA of UO2 powder are in a descending order as follows: reduction temperature TR, calcination temperature TC, calcination time tC, and reduction time tR. Thus, we established Brandon model by determining corresponding parameters in that order. By using the method of least squares and Solver tool of Microsoft Excel, the function f1(TR) is determined in the equation as follows:
@(3)
ŷ1 was calculated as follows:
@(4)
With the same calculation, the other functions of TC, tC, and tR were obtained as bellows:
@(5)
@(6)
@(7)
The corresponding independent functions ŷ1 were:
@(8)
@(9)
@(10)
All of these values are reported in Table 1.
Table 1. Experimental and calculated data of function f1(TR) and ŷ1; f2(TC) and ŷ2; f3(tC) and ŷ3; f4(tR) and ŷ4; and SSA(Cal.) (ŷ) used to establish Brandon mathematical model.
The constant a in Brandon equation was calculated from average of y4 to be 1.00006. Thus, Brandon function describing the effect of the process parameters on the SSA of the UO2 powder is in the form:
@(11)
@(12)
SSA(Cal.) values of the UO2 powder are shown in Table 1.
The Brandon mathematical model was tested by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. We have two groups:
Group SSA(Ex.): X1, X2, X3, …, Xn1; distribution ÿ
Group SSA(Cal.): Y1, Y2, Y3, …, Yn2; distribution ŷ
Null Hypothesis: SSA(Ex.) = SSA(cal.)
The two groups were combined into one group and ordered data in the combined group SSA(1) ≤ SSA(2) ≤ . . . ≤ SSA(n1+n2); and then assigned ranks (as in Table 2).
Table 2. Order of all observations in the combined sample and assign ranks of the group WT (SSA(Cal.) data are underlined).
Thus, sum of ranks S of group ŷ is calculated as follows:
S = 2 + 4+5 + 12+13 + 14+15 + 17+18 + 21+23 + 25+26 + 27 = 222
Mean rank (μT) of distribution ŷ is:
@
And the variance is:
@@
95% reliability of μT is:
@@@
The sum of ranks S of group ŷ is 222; within reliability range from 160.35 to 245.65, so two groups, SSA(Ex.) and SSA(Cal.), are asserted to be the same. Fig. 2 is the plot comparing SSA(Ex.) with SSA(Cal.) of the UO2 powder indicating the agreement of the proposed calculation with the experimental data.

3.2. Test of sinterability of UO2 powders
Density of the UO2 ceramic pellets was characterized mainly on the sinterability of the UO2 powders. The resintering test was performed to check the thermal stability of the pellets after sintering. In order to test sinterability of the UO2 powders, these samples were prepared at various conversion temperatures of 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C with a conversion time of 5 h. According to our test, the conversion time of 5 h is sufficient to eliminate fluoride down to below 100 μg per gram of the powder. Table 3 shows some characteristics of the obtained ex-AUC and ex-ADU uranium oxide powder samples. The powder samples were compacted to obtain green pellets. Sintering of green pellets was performed using a batch type laboratory sintering furnace at a temperature of 1700 °C as described in the experimental section.
Table 3. Characteristics of the UO2 powder.
The densities of UO2 ceramic pellet samples prepared from ex-ADU uranium oxide powders at conversion temperatures of 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C were shown in Table 4. After resintered, the densities increase 0.86 ± 1.89%, 1.04 ± 1.21%, 0.30 ± 0.73%, 0.52 ± 0.54% and 0.70 ± 0.36%, respectively with the above conversion temperatures. The coefficients of variations (CVs) of the densities and the results of resinter test indicated that the UO2 ceramic pellets prepared from the ex-ADU uranium oxide powders at the conversion temperature of 750 °C were more stable than those prepared at other temperatures. Fig. 3 shows the density of sintered pellet as a function of conversion temperature with and without a pore former. The experiment data show a slight increase in density with the increase of conversion temperature in case of no pore former – ammonium oxalate. In the presence of pore former, the density of sintered pellets has a decreasing tendency with an increase of pore former content. In this case, the effect of conversion temperature on pellet density is not clear. It might attribute to a bad distribution of pore former during the powder preparation. Retesting sinterability of the ex-ADU uranium oxide powders at conversion temperatures of 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C was performed at a sintering temperature of 1700 °C for 8 h. The densities of the UO2 ceramic pellet samples were also shown in Table 4 and their densities increasing by the resintering were 0.43 ± 0.19%, 0.57 ± 0.10% and 0.53 ± 0.23%, respectively. The average densities were 93.67 ± 0.53, 93.64 ± 0.80 and 96.54 ± 0.57, respectively with the above conversion temperatures. From the CVs of the densities, the resinter data and, especially, the average densities, it is apparent that the sinterability of the ex-ADU uranium oxide powder at the conversion temperature of 800 °C was better than those under other conditions.

Fig. 3. Plot of the ADU- derived UO2 pellet density vs. the conversion temperatures.
The sinterability of ex-AUC uranium oxide powders was tested. According to our observation, many UO2 pellets prepared from the powder samples at conversion temperatures of 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C were broken in sintering, meanwhile, all UO2 pellets prepared from the powder samples at conversion temperatures of 550 °C and 600 °C were not broken. Table 5 indicates the density data of the UO2 ceramic pellet samples prepared from the ex-AUC uranium oxide powders at conversion temperatures of 550 °C and 600 °C and their resinter data were 0.63 ± 0.30% and 0.49 ± 0.35%, respectively. Retesting sinterability of the ex-AUC uranium oxide powders at conversion temperatures of 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C was also performed at sintering temperature of 1700 °C for 8 h. The densities of the UO2 ceramic pellet samples were also indicated in Table 5 and their resinter data were 0.55 ± 0.25%, 0.66 ± 0.59% and 0.64 ± 0.24%, respectively. The average densities were 94.68 ± 1.02, 95.71 ± 0.68 and 94.97 ± 0.90, respectively with the above conversion temperatures. The CVs of the densities, the resinter data and, especially, the average densities, showed that the ex-AUC uranium oxide powder at the conversion temperature from 550 °C to 600 °C was more highly sinterable than those converted at other temperatures.
Table 5. Density test data of the ceramic pellets prepared from the ex-AUC uranium oxide powder samples in various conversion temperatures.
SSAs of ex-ADU and ex-AUC uranium oxide powders calculated by equation (12) and in Refs. [14], respectively, were shown in Table 6. The SSA of the ex-ADU uranium oxide powder at conversion temperature of 800 °C was 2.4 m2/g, similar with the SSA of the ex-AUC uranium oxide powder at conversion temperature from 550 °C to 600 °C – in the range from 2.5 m2/g to 2,3 m2/g. Thus, the proposed models can be used to explain why conversion temperatures of the ADU- and the AUC-derived UO2 powders were 800 °C and 550 °C–600 °C, respectively.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model describing the effect of the fabrication parameters on SSA of uranium oxide powders prepared via ADU route. The Brandon model as presented in equation (12) is used to describe the relationship between the essential fabrication parameters [(reduction temperature (TR), calcination temperature (TC), calcination time (tC) and reduction time (tR)] and SSA of the obtained ex-ADU uranium oxide powder product. Testing sinterability of the UO2 powder was performed and the proposed models were used to explain that conversion temperatures of the ammonium diuranate- and the ammonium uranyl carbonate-derived UO2 powders were 800 °C and 550 °C–600 °C, respectively.
