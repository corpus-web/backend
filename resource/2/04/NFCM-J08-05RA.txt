Abstract
For hydrogen isotope enrichment/separation applicable to fusion fuel processing, environmental tritium safety confinement, or recovery of tritium from heavy water reactors, a hydrogen displacement adsorption process system is recommended using molecular sieve 5A as the separation material. For simulation and optimization of the process, mathematical models and a solving method are provided to calculate the breakthrough curves during the displacement adsorption, in which various parameters including pressure drop and mass transfer coefficients are allowed to be changeable. Based on the calculated results, the effects of the column size, the flow rate, and the outlet pressure on the enrichment factor, the recovery ratio and the separation ability of the column are comprehensively analyzed. The conclusions have some theoretical guiding significance for the development of hydrogen isotope separation by the displacement adsorption method.

I. INTRODUCTION
Waste tritium recovered from various tritium treatment processes is stored as tritiated water in many cases, where a problem of accumulating storage inventory is coming to the fore. The waste management dealing with this problem requires some effective and economical methods for hydrogen isotope enrichment (or separation). Since cryogenic distillation is usually applied to large-scale cases and its structure and process are quite complex,1 a more convenient and simpler process would be requested for volume reduction of the tritiated waste storage managed in tritium-handling laboratories or facilities.2 For this application, a process based on the principle of displacement adsorption may be the most suitable candidate.3 Among various processes based on displacement chromatography, such as hydrogen displacement adsorption chromatography, frontal chromatography, and self-displacement chromatography, a hydrogen displacement adsorption process is a promising candidate because a higher recovery ratio (RR) and enrichment factor (EF) can be realized if proper separation materials are used.4,5
Among the variety of materials used for this application, palladium (or palladium alloy) is widely reported6,7 because moderate operating conditions are required when used to separate hydrogen isotopes. However, the high price, proneness to pulverization,8 and aging effect9 greatly increase the installation and maintenance costs. To save on cost, techniques based on a variety of molecular sieves (MSs) such as 3A, 4A, 5A, and 13X are being developed. Among them, MS 5A has been the most widely reported.10–12
For the enrichment of a trace amount of tritium from hydrogen isotopes, a hydrogen displacement adsorption process method is proposed in this technical note, and MS 5A, rather than palladium-based materials, is used as the separation material. Aiming at optimizing the process, the effect of key parameters (including the size of the separation column, the flow rate, and the outlet pressure) on the separation properties of the process is analyzed by process simulation.
Because of the difficulty of an experiment involving tritium and the similarity of different hydrogen isotopes,13 this technical note presents a process simulation and optimization design for the enrichment of only a trace amount of D2 in the H2-D2 mixture.
The cycling operation sequence of the hydrogen displacement process is as follows: (1) cooling the column to liquid nitrogen temperature, (2) charging the column with pure protium, (3) feeding the column with H2-D2 mixture, and (4) heating the column and recovering the desorbed gas. Since MS 5A adsorbs D2 preferentially, D2 displaces H2 in the adsorbed phase, and in this way the D2 is enriched in the adsorbed phase during step (3). Since the performance of the process is mainly dependent on the third step, the process simulation and optimization are focused only on this step in our study.
II. PROCESS SIMULATION
II.A. Mathematical Model
The following assumptions were made for model derivation:
assumption 1: ideal gas behavior
assumption 2: constant temperature behavior
assumption 3: plug flow model
assumption 4: zero axial dispersion in mass balance equations
assumption 5: negligible hydrogen isotope exchange reaction.
To verify the reasonability of assumption 1, we calculated the gas density of H2 at 77.4 K and 0.2 MPa based on the model by Jiangtao14 and the ideal gas state equation, respectively. The calculated densities are 0.3118 and 0.3108 mol/liter (l), respectively. It is obvious that the assumption of ideal gas behavior for hydrogen is reasonable.
The discharged heat of the displacement process depends on the difference of the molar adsorption heat of H2 and D2 as well as the adsorbed amount of D2 during the adsorption. Since there is only a small difference between the molar adsorption heat of H2 and D2, and the concentration of D2 in raw gas discussed in this technical note is very low (0.1%), the discharged heat during the displacement adsorption is too low to significantly influence the temperature of the column. Consequently, assumption 2 is reasonable. The ratio of the column length to the inner diameter of the column discussed in our study is much more than 10 (Ref. 15) so that it is acceptable that there is no radial variation in the concentration; that is, the plug flow model is applicable to this system. Since the gas velocity discussed in this technical note is high enough, it is reasonable to neglect the effect of axial dispersion.16
Even under normal temperature, the rate of hydrogen isotope exchange reaction is quite slow in the case of noncatalysis. So, it is reasonable to ignore the component HD produced by hydrogen isotope exchange reaction at 77.4 K and 0.2 MPa.
Based on the above assumption, the component mass balance is given as follows:

and the total mass balance is set up as follows:

Since the pressure drop cannot be neglected under conditions of large flow rate and long separation column, the following Ergun equation17 was adopted to describe the pressure drop:

where

=

We can find from Eq. (3) that the pressure drop (the first item in the left side) is combined with  and u, so it can be varied with u, , and.
In many cases of the process simulation for gas separation by adsorption, the assumption of instantaneous adsorption equilibrium18 may lead to a large error when used to calculate the breakthrough curves of hydrogen isotopes under the conditions of large gas velocity. To rigorously simulate the process for hydrogen isotope separation, the third item on the left sides of Eqs. (1) and (2) is substituted by Eq. (4):

@(11)
where  is the pore radius of the adsorbent (m).
According to Eq. (10), an appropriate isotherm model is requested to describe the  dependence of . Since the two-site Langmuir model can fit hydrogen isotope adsorption isotherms fairly well and the model is easy to calculate, the extended two-site Langmuir model was selected to describe the multicomponent adsorption isotherms, given by
@(12)
where a1 [mol/(Pa·kg)], a2 [mol/(Pa·kg)], b1 (l/Pa), and b2 (l/Pa) are coefficients. Based on Eq. (12),  in Eq. (10) is given by
@(13a)
and
@(13b)
From the expression of Eqs. (1–10), Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), it is obvious that  change with position and time and are correlated with each other, so partial differential equations (PDEs) together with Eqs. (4) through (13) are requested to be solved simultaneously by a numerical method.
II.B. Numerical Solution
The displacement step in our study is characterized by the mass flow controller at the inlet for flow rate control and the pressure controller (or back pressure valve) at the outlet for operation pressure control. So, the corresponding boundary conditions were set as follows:

Among the various methods for the solution of PDEs, the finite difference method has the advantages of simple principle and being widely used for solving PDEs. However, based on the principle of finite difference, traditional methods such as the chasing method cannot solve the nonlinear PDEs presented in this technical note because the boundary conditions do not belong to a single point.
To solve the above problem, a method is proposed in this technical note and is illustrated as follows. The first step is to change all the PDEs into nonlinear equations by finite difference approximation. Second, Eqs. (1–10) and Eq. (13) are combined with boundary conditions to shape  equations by programming, where n is the number of variables for a single discrete point and (m − 1) is the number of the grids corresponding to the column length. In the next step, the iteration method is adopted to solve the  equations, in which the initial conditions were used to calculate equations corresponding to the first time step, and the initial conditions required for the next time step were provided by the calculated results at the previous time step. Finally, the time stepwise developing profiles of concentrations, the flow rates, the pressure, and the adsorbed amounts on distance mesh points in the separation column were obtained.
II.C. Parameter Estimation
II.C.1. Isotherm Parameters
Except for adsorption isotherms and surface diffusion coefficients, all parameters required for the calculation were readily available (listed in Table I). To obtain the parameters of the adsorption isotherms, we experimentally determined the pure H2 and D2 adsorption isotherms, respectively, by the pressure-volume-temperature method and fitted the experimental data using the two-site Langmuir model. The fitted parameters are listed in Table I, and a comparison between the fitted and the experimental curves is shown in Fig. 1. It is shown that the two-site Langmuir model can describe the adsorption isotherm fairly well.

II.C.2. Surface Diffusion Coefficients
To obtain the surface diffusion coefficients, we experimentally measured the breakthrough curves. Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the experiment apparatus. The coil-shaped test column was made of a 0.64-m stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 0.011 m, in which spherical MS 5A pellets with average diameter of 2.18 mm (provided by Shanghai Molsion Molecular Sieve Company, Ltd) were packed. The weight W of the packed MS 5A was 43.8 g, and  was estimated to be 0.51 according to Tanaka et al.’s work.22 The value ε is estimated to be 0.456 by the following formula23:

TABLE II Conditions in the Experiments and Values of the Properties of MS 5A
Before adsorption, the packed column was evacuated at 673 K for about 24 h by a scroll-type vacuum pump. Subsequently, this column was immersed in liquid nitrogen and filled with pure D2 or H2. The duration of this step was not less than 30 min, and the saturated pressure was kept at about 100 kPa. The above procedure was carried out before each breakthrough curve measurement.
Two series of experiments with different flow rates were carried out. One was H2 displacing D2 adsorption, and the other was D2 displacing H2 adsorption. H2 displacing D2 adsorption was carried out by charging pure H2 into the column that was previously saturated with pure D2. During the displacement adsorption, the gas flow rate of H2 was controlled by a mass flowmeter, the outlet pressure of the column was controlled by a back pressure valve, and the outlet gas was sampled at intervals and analyzed by an off-line high-resolution mass spectrometer (model: Evolution; company: “NU”). The H2 breakthrough curves are shown in Fig. 3a. The experiment of D2 displacing H2 adsorption was similar to that of H2 displacing D2 adsorption, and the D2 breakthrough curve is shown in Fig. 3b.
Fig. 3. Comparison between calculated and experimental breakthrough curves (scatter points: experimental data; solid lines: calculated data).
To estimate the surface diffusion coefficients, the breakthrough curve of D2 displacing H2 was calculated based on mathematical models and methods for solving the PDEs mentioned above. During the calculation, parameters listed in Table II as well as trial values of  and were used. We continually changed the value of  and until the calculated breakthrough curve fit the experimental result fairly well. The final calculated results are shown in Fig. 3 by solid lines.
Figure 3b is a comparison between the calculated and the experimental results. It is observed from Fig. 3b that the calculated breakthrough curve agrees with the experimental one fairly well. In addition, using the same values of  and, we calculated the breakthrough curves of H2 displacing D2 and made a comparison with experimental data (Fig. 3a). It was found that the calculated curves are also consistent with the experimental data fairly well in the condition of different flow rates. In such a way, the fitted  and were verified to be applicable to calculation of the breakthrough curves. The estimated values of  and  are 5.0 × 10–7 m2/s and 3.5 × 10–7 m2/s, respectively.
III. PROCESS OPTIMIZATION
As can be seen from the above models, the dynamic variation of several operation parameters (including mass transfer coefficients, gas density, diffusion coefficients, pressure drop, etc.) with the gas velocity, pressure, and component was considered. In addition, the structure parameters of the separation column including the voidage of the packing density were also set to be variable. So, the reliability of the mathematical model for the simulation of the large-scale process can be guaranteed because the possible amplification effect is avoided as far as possible based on the above considerations.
The operating pressure, the flow rate, the separation column length, and the inner diameter of the column can significantly affect the separation performance. So, we discuss the effects of the above factors on the performance of the process based on breakthrough curve calculation. In this way, process optimization is carried out.
III.A. Performance Evaluation Indices
To evaluate and optimize the performance of the process, the following indices are adopted.
III.A.1. Enrichment Factor
We introduce EF to evaluate the ability to concentrate the heavier isotope from a hydrogen isotope mixture. In the case of D2 enrichment from the H2-D2 mixture, EF is defined as follows:
@(21)
where  is the D2 molar fraction in the source gas. According to Eq. (21), a higher value of EF means that a higher concentration of D2 in the column is obtained. If the amount of hydrogen isotope mixture in the gas phase is negligible compared to that of the solid phase and the concentration of D2 in the H2-D2 mixture is quite low, then Eq. (21) is reduced to the expression of the separation factor,24 so EF is limited by the separation factor, which is determined by the thermo-dynamical properties of the hydrogen-MS 5A system.
III.A.2. Recovery Ratio
We define RR as follows:
(22)
III.A.3. Separation Ability
We define separation ability (SA) as the amount of source gas consumed per unit time. There are two choices for SA improvement. One is to enlarge the handling capacity in a unit time, and the other is to save the time for the same handling capacity.
III.B. Effect of the Outlet Pressure
The outlet pressure partly determines the value of the mass transfer coefficient and the adsorption capacity of MS 5A (Ref. 21), so that can significantly influence the shape of the penetration curve. Keeping other parameters unchanged, the breakthrough curves of D2 under different outlet pressure conditions were calculated and are shown in Fig. 4. It is found in Fig. 4 that a lower pressure results in a shorter time for the raw gas to penetrate the separation column. This is mainly due to the decrease of adsorption capacity of the separation column under lower pressure.
Fig. 4. Variation of the calculated breakthrough curves of D2 with outlet pressure under the condition of D2 displacing H2.
Based on the calculated results for the displacing adsorption, we calculated the time dependence of EF and recovery under various outlet pressure conditions (shown in Fig. 5). As can be seen in Fig. 5, under a given pressure condition, EF increases linearly with time in the initial stage but becomes unchanged at the end of the adsorption. Unlike EF, RR is constant at the beginning and then drops nonlinearly with time. For a given time, RR increases with the increasing pressure while EF decreases. So, there must be a maximum value of (EF + RR) during the adsorption, as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, it was found from Fig. 5 that the maximum of the (EF + RR) decreases with increasing of the pressure, and a longer time is required to achieve the maximum value under a higher-pressure condition.
Fig. 5. The calculated time dependence of EF and RR under different outlet pressure conditions (calculation conditions are the same as in Fig. 4).
Since EF and RR are equally important indices for hydrogen isotope separation, it seems that a lower outlet pressure is recommended because a lower outlet pressure can produce a higher level of (EF + RR). However, the adsorption capacity of the separation column decreases dramatically with a decline of the outlet pressure, which leads to a significant decline of SA. So, when EF, RR, and SA are comprehensively considered, atmospheric pressure may be a good compromise.
III.C. Effect of the Flow Rate
The breakthrough curves under different flow rate conditions were calculated and are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen in Fig. 6, with increasing of the flow rate, the penetration time decreases, and the concentration of D2 more quickly rises to the same level as in the source gas. For easy comparison, the variation of EF and RR with the feeding amount under different flow conditions was calculated and is shown in Fig. 7. It is obvious that a larger flow rate leads to a lower level of EF and RR under the condition of a given feeding amount. However, a larger flow rate is beneficial to save time, in order to improve SA. To solve the above contradiction, it is necessary to optimize the column length. The effect of the column length is discussed in Sec. III.D.

Fig. 7. Variation of EF and RR with the charged amount under different gas flow rate conditions.
III.D. Effect of the Column Length
Based on the calculated results for the displacing adsorption, the variation of EF corresponding to the same level of RR (99.0%) with the column length was calculated and is shown in Fig. 8. It was found that a longer column leads to a higher level of EF when the flow rate is unchanged. In addition, a longer column is required to obtain the same level of EF when the flow rate increases.
Fig. 8. Variation of EF with the column length and flow rate (RR = 99.0%).
When the column is lengthened, the feeding time and the adsorption capacity are enlarged almost in the same proportion; that is, SA of the displacement adsorption step is not enhanced in the displacement adsorption step. However, the time for subsequent steps generally did not change significantly if a proper process was chosen. So, there can be savings in the total time for the enrichment of D2 from a given amount of H2-D2 mixture. Therefore, a longer column improves EF, RR, and SA.
It is notable that the pressure drop in practice is not negligible when quite a long column is chosen. To reduce the pressure drop without sacrificing SA, optimizing the inner diameter of the separation column may be an effective method. The effect of the inner diameter of the separation column is discussed in detail in Sec. III.E.
III.E. Effect of the Inner Diameter of the Column
A comparison of breakthrough curves of D2 calculated for columns with different inner diameters is shown in Fig. 9. For easy comparison, during the calculation the flow rate in different columns was adjusted to keep a nearly constant gas velocity. It was found that there is no noticeable difference in the shape of the breakthrough curves of D2, except that the breakthrough time corresponding to the larger inner diameter is delayed.
Fig. 9. Comparison of the breakthrough curves of D2 corresponding to different inner diameters.
According to Eqs. (17) and (18), ε decreases with increasing of the inner diameter of the column, while the packing density increases with a decline of ε. Subsequently, a larger feeding time is required for the column of unit volume.
On the other hand, since the pressure of the outlet is kept constant by the pressure controller, the pressure in the column (especially near the inlet) rises with a decrease of ε according to Eq. (3). The adsorption capacity of the separation material in the column increases with increasing of the pressure, so more raw gas is required for the column of unit volume under larger pressure. The above two effects result in a longer adsorption time.
We calculated EFs for the different column diameters, and under the condition that RR = 99.0%, the value of EF is 1.969 for the larger  and 1.960 for the smaller one. A larger inner diameter of the column leads to only a slight increase in the level of EF, while a more significant effect dramatically increases SA. This can be explained by two aspects. When the time for the subsequent process is usually unchanged (which can be achieved by proper techniques), the time for a whole adsorption-desorption cycle is not multiplied under the same condition of the gas velocity (shown in Fig. 9). On the other hand, the feeding amount is enlarged greatly with increasing of the inner diameter of the column. Consequently, increasing the inner diameter of the column can significantly improve SA without reducing the level of EF and RR. It is notable that the above conclusion has a precondition; namely, the ratio of the column length to the column width is larger than about 10 (only in this condition can the wall effect be ignored). In our discussion about the optimization of separation column structure, the above conditions are always met.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
For the optimization of the hydrogen displacement adsorption process applied for the enrichment of D2 from H2-D2 mixture, mathematical models were constructed, and breakthrough curves of D2 under various conditions were calculated. Based on the displacement adsorption process simulation, the effects of key parameters—including the column length, the flow rate, the outlet pressure, and the inner diameter of the column—on the separation performance were comprehensively analyzed. The main conclusions can be drawn as follows:
The method presented in this technical note is successfully used to solve the PDEs with boundary conditions that do not belong to a single point.
The suggestion that the outlet pressure is set to atmospheric pressure is a good compromise when design indicators including EF, RR, and SA are equally important.
When the column is long enough, increasing the flow rate is expected to acquire a high level of EF, RR, and SA.
Under the condition that the wall effect is negligible, increasing the inner diameter of the column can significantly improve SA without reducing the level of EF and RR.
