Abstract
In this study, a series of 1-octadecanol (OD) composite phase change materials (PCMs) with stable shape were prepared by adding nano‑silicon carbide (SiC), expanded graphite (EG) and SiC/EG composite respectively. The thermal conductivity of OD/SiC, OD/EG and OD/SiC/EG were 0.432, 0.607 and 0.996 W·m−1·K−1 respectively when the mass fraction was all 5 wt%. The results indicated that among the above three additives, SiC/EG composite had the best enhancement effect on the thermal conductivity of organic PCMs, while the thermal conductivity of OD/SiC/EG composite with 9 wt% SiC/EG addition was 1.674 W·m−1·K−1, which was more than 4 times that of pure OD. SEM results showed that SiC distributed uniformly on the surface of EG without obvious agglomeration. SiC/EG could replace EG as a new excellent thermal conductivity reinforcement. The phase transition temperature and phase transition enthalpy of OD/SiC/EG composite were 58.6 °C and 210 J/g, respectively, which also processed sufficient thermal stability. The prepared OD/SiC/EG composite heat storage materials had both high thermal conductivity and large storage energy density, which can meet the demands of low temperature heat storage fields, such as thermal control of electronic components, building materials and solar energy systems.

1. Introduction
The energy of renewable resources is becoming a major problem nowadays, and researchers around the world are working to solve the energy crisis [1,2]. Phase change materials (PCMs) used in energy storage systems are crucial for energy utilization [3]. Solid-liquid PCMs are the key factors in the development of thermal energy storage (TES) technology, which greatly contribute to the utilization of renewable energy and improve energy conversion efficiency [4,5].
Organic PCMs have been extensively studied and widely used in TES systems due to their advantages of chemical and thermal stability, low undercooling, high latent heat, low cost, non-toxicity and corrosion resistance etc. [6,7]. They can store and release heat with higher storage density through melting and solidifying in small temperature differences, therefore they are very attractive in TES and thermal protection [[8], [9], [10]]. Nevertheless, the main disadvantage of organic PCMs is their unacceptable low thermal conductivity and leakage during phase transformation. In order to improve the low thermal conductivity of organic PCMs, a great deal of research has been conducted on various combination of organic PCMs and high thermal conductivity materials [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [16], graphene [17] and porous carbon [18,19] have excellent properties such as ultra-high surface area and high thermal conductivity, and have become the preferred materials for thermal performance enhancement. Fixing PCMs into porous scaffolds to form encapsulation structures to obtain shape-stable composite PCMs (ssPCMs) has been recognized as an effective method to overcome the above disadvantages [[20], [21], [22]]. It is disappointing that few composite organic PCMs possess satisfactory thermal conductivity while maintaining high TES density.
SARI et al. [23] used silica fume (SF) to contain fatty acids and prevent them from leaching during phase transition, and added carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of different amounts to increase the thermal conductivity to the required level. It was found that the doping process of CNTs resulted in a significant increase in thermal conductivity and significantly shortened the charging and discharging time of composite PCMs. Sarı et al. [24] also used capric acid-stearic acid eutectic mixture as PCMs, which was first impregnated with expanded vermiculite clay by melting/blending method and then doped with CNTs. They found that thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs was increased as 83.3, 125.0 and 258.3% by CNTs doping 1, 3 and 5 wt%. Yuan et al. [25] prepared erythritol/expanded graphite composite PCMs for energy storage at medium temperature by three steps of impregnation, compression and sintering. The results showed that the stable composite PCMs containing 10 wt% EG had good comprehensive properties, and its thermal conductivity was up to 12.51 W·m−1·K−1 (17.38 times higher than that of pure erythritol), which maintained good cycle stability after 140 thermal cycles. Sarı and Karaipekli [26] aimed determination of proper amount of paraffin (n-docosane) absorbed into expanded graphite (EG) to obtain form-stable composite as PCM. It was found that thermal conductivity of the pure paraffin and the composite PCMs including 2, 4, 7 and 10 wt% EG were measured as 0.22, 0.40, 0.52, 0.68 and 0.82 W·m−1·K−1, respectively. Sarı et al. [27] also prepared six new kinds of building composite PCMs by using vacuum impregnation method. It was concluded that the thermal conductivity of building composite PCMs was enhanced considerably by addition of EG and the improvement in thermal conductivity of the building composite PCMs caused appreciably reduction in their melting times. Wan et al. [28] prepared the polyethylene glycol (PEG)/SiO2/acrylic acid morphology stabilized PCMs by sol-gel method combined with in-situ polymerization. When the temperature was far above the melting point of PEG, 120 °C, all the prepared ssPCMs can keep solid without any leakage. Karaman et al. [29] researched the preparation, characterization, and determination of TES properties of PEG/diatomite composite as a novel form-stable composite PCM. They found that the PEG could be retained by 50 wt% into pores of the diatomite without the leakage of melted PEG from the composite. And the results also showed that the composite PCM had good thermal reliability and chemical stability. Sharma et al. [30] studied the phase transformation behavior of the new palmitic acid and titanium dioxide solid nanoparticles composites. The results showed that titanium dioxide nanoparticles did not affect the chemical structure of palmitic acid, but could improve the chemical stability of palmitic acid.
Nano-SiC has the advantages of stable chemical performance, high thermal conductivity, small thermal expansion coefficient and large specific surface area. As far as we know, little research has been done on the enhancement of thermal conductivity of organic PCMs by nano-SiC, let alone its application as an effective filler in TES. Expanded graphite (EG) [[31], [32], [33]] has unique nano-micron pore structure that can enhance the heat transfer of organic PCMs and is a suitable choice for combination with nano‑silicon carbide. In this paper, a general strategy was proposed to attach nano-SiC to EG by ultrasonic dispersion and calcination to form porous thermal conductivity enhancement phase with high specific surface area. Because of its high enthalpy of phase transition, good stability, low vapor pressure and low cost, 1-octadecanol (OD) was chosen as PCM for latent heat storage. OD/SiC/EG composites exhibited good shape stability and thermal reliability, and showed faster thermal response during heating and exothermic process. These satisfactory performances indicated that this study may open a new door for the further development of efficient heat dissipation and high performance TES. Meanwhile, the improvements in thermal conductivity and thermal stability will make the new composite phase change material a better choice for solar thermal storage systems, industrial waste heat recovery, thermal comfort clothing and other fields.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Nanometer SiC (Nano-SiC, <150 nm) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. 1-Octadecanol (C18H38O, OD), ethanol absolute (C2H5OH) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (C2H6O2·x, HEC), were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Expandable graphite (C, 50 mesh) was purchased from Qingdao Jinrilai Graphite Co., Ltd., China. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used directly without treatment.
2.2. Preparation of SiC/EG
5 g of expandable graphite was weighed by an electronic balance, and uniformly coated on the bottom of 1 L silicon carbide crucible. The crucible was placed in electric resistance furnace at 900 °C, then taken out after heat preservation for 1 min, and naturally cooled to obtain expanded graphite (EG).
3 g SiC was dispersed in 400 mL of absolute ethanol, then 0.5 g hydroxyethyl cellulose was added as dispersant. The mixture was dispersed by ultrasound for 2 h, and then stirred with 3 g EG for 1 h until no precipitation appeared at the bottom. The mixture was then transferred to a crucible and calcined in a muffle furnace at 200 °C for 1 h to remove anhydrous ethanol and organic dispersants, thereby producing the SiC/EG composites.
2.3. Preparation of OD/ SiC/EG composite PCMs
The OD/ SiC/EG composite PCMs were prepared by melt blending and vacuum adsorption. First, OD was completely melted in a constant temperature water bath at 90 °C, then SiC/EG thermal conductivity enhancement phases with mass fractions of 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt%, 7 wt% and 9 wt% were added to the molten OD. The mixture was stirred evenly at 90 °C for 40 min, then transferred to 90 °C vacuum drying oven for vacuum adsorption for 5 h. Finally, the mixture was poured into the mould (30 mm in diameter) and cooled to room temperature. The above samples were labeled OD/SiC/EG-1, OD/SiC/EG-3, OD/SiC/EG-5, OD/SiC/EG-7 and OD/SiC/EG-9, respectively.
The above steps were repeated using EG and nano-SiC instead of SiC/EG to prepare OD/EG-5, OD/SiC-1, OD/SiC-3, OD/SiC-5, OD/SiC-7 and OD/SiC-9 composite PCMs. The flow chart of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1, and some prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2.

2.4. Characterization
Phase and crystal structure of all the samples were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, D8-ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα irradiation (k = 1.5406 Å) at scanning rate (2θ) of 0.1°/s and scanning range of 5°-85°. Chemical structure of the samples were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, USA) at frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1. The microscopic morphology of the samples was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus, Germany). The thermal performance of the prepared PCMs was detected by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC, 8500, Germany NETZSCH) with temperature range of 20–90 °C and heating-cooling rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Thermal stability of the samples were characterized by Thermo Gravimetric (TG) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) on a Synchronous thermal analyzer (STA449F3, Germany) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The thermal conductivity of the samples was measured by thermal constant analyzer (TPS2500S, Hot Disk, Sweden). The measuring range was 0.005–1800 W·m−1·K−1 and the measuring accuracy was better than 5%. Each sample to be tested was pressed into a cylinder (30 mm in diameter and 10 mm in height). For reducing error and increasing measurement accuracy, every measuring datum was repeated three times, and an average was applied.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase and chemical structure
Fig. 3 shows the XRD spectra of SiC, EG, SiC/EG and composite PCMs. The curve of SiC displayed a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 34.5° and another weak diffraction peak at 60.2°; the curve of EG displayed a strong diffraction peak at 26.4° and a weak diffraction peak at 54.5°, corresponding to the (002) and (004) crystal planes of the graphite crystal, respectively, which were consistent with previously reported literature [34]. The diffraction curves of SiC-EG composites were the superposition of the diffraction peaks of SiC and EG, but no other peaks appear. This indicated that SiC was successfully attached to the graphite sheet of EG, which could be proved in the micro-morphology of the composites. The main strong peaks of OD occurred at 21.8° and 24.7° [35], while the diffraction peaks of SiC become very weak and almost invisible on the curve of SiC-OD composites. In OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs, only the strong peaks of OD and EG were detected, while the characteristic peaks of SiC were concealed and could not be marked due to its low content. There was no trace of other diffraction peaks in the XRD spectra of composite PCMs, which indicated that there was no chemical reaction between the thermally enhanced phase SiC, EG, SiC/EG and OD during the composite process, but only a simple physical combination.
Fig. 3. The XRD patterns of SiC, EG, SiC/EG and the OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs.
Fig. 4 shows the FTIR diagram of SiC, EG, SiC/EG, OD and OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs. The spectrum of SiC displayed a wide absorption peak at 882 cm−1, which was attributed to the stretching vibration of Csingle bondSi. The intensity of the infrared absorption peak of EG was so weak that no absorption peak can be marked in the spectra. Absorption bands of pure OD materials include the out-of-plane and in-plane bending vibration of OH groups (730 and 1463 cm−1, respectively); vibration peak of Csingle bondC skeleton (525 cm−1); Cdouble bondO the stretching vibration of Cdouble bondO (1063 cm−1); the asymmetric and symmetrical stretching of Csingle bondH (2917 and 2850 cm−1, respectively) [36]. The absorption peaks of OD/SiC/EG composites were consistent with those of OD, with the absorption peaks of SiC/EG composites not being detected due to the low intensity. Conclusively, the peak position of OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs did not move, which indicated that OD had good compatibility with SiC/EG. There was no chemical reaction but physical combination in the preparation process, which was consistent with the results of XRD analysis.

3.2. Micromorphology
The morphologies of EG, SiC/EG and the composite PCMs at different magnification were observed by SEM. The expandable graphite was in the form of fine flakes in macroscopical view. After expansion at high temperature, EG (Fig. 5a) was worm-like with distinct lamellar structure. The graphite layers interlaced with each other to form abundant micropore, which could support and prevent leakage of organic PCMs. After compounding with SiC, SiC/EG (Fig. 5b, c and d) remained worm-like morphology with an overall grayish white color. There were a large amount of SiC nanoparticles adhering to the interlaminar and micropore of EG, which was snowflake-like and uniformly distributed without obvious segregation. The nano-SiC was tightly wrapped in the solidified OD, with no regular spatial morphology after melt blending. OD/SiC (Fig. 5e) showed a large number of fine protrusions on the surface of the sample, which was nano-SiC wrapped by OD with obvious agglomeration. From Fig. 5f, it can be found that the surface of EG had been coated with OD, and the inside of pore was filled with OD. The SiC particles covered internally could not be observed but could increase the contact area with OD. The overall morphology of SiC/EG coated with OD remained lamellar, which indicated that SiC/EG had excellent supporting effect on OD and could prevent leakage of composite PCMs during melting process.

3.3. Phase change behaviors
The phase transition temperature and latent heat of composite PCMs were measured by DSC. As shown in Fig. 6, only one endothermic peak was observed in the melting process of OD/SiC (Fig. 6a) and OD/SiC/EG (Fig. 6b); while during solidification, the transformation of solid γ phase into α phase showed obvious supercooling, resulting in two exothermic peaks in the phase diagram of the solidification curve. It was noteworthy that the peak shapes of all samples were similar, which stated clearly that the phase transformation behavior of pure OD, OD/SiC and OD/SiC/EG composites were similar, further indicating that there was no chemical reaction between OD and the thermal conductivity enhancement phase during impregnation. As shown in Table 1, the melting temperature, crystallization temperature and solid-solid phase transition temperature of the composite thermal storage material decreased compared with pure OD, but the thermal storage capacity did not decrease significantly. The enthalpy of phase transition tended to decrease with the increase of the amount of heat conduction enhancement phase. Phase change latent heat is an important indicator to evaluate the thermal storage performance of composite PCMs. The melting latent heat of the PCMs with 5 wt% SiC/EG was 211.2 J/g, and its solidification latent heat was −206.1 J/g, which were 92.4% and 95.1% of pure OD, respectively. OD was the latent heat provider in the composition of composite PCMs. The addition of SiC/EG thermally enhanced phase resulted in a slight decrease in heat storage capacity. Nevertheless, the latent heat value above 200 J/g can still meet the application of TES, such as solar energy systems, waste heat recovery systems, thermal comfort buildings, etc.

OD/SiC/EG-9	58.4	192.3	56.7	49.1	−191.5
3.4. Thermal stability
TG tests were performed to characterize the effect of high conductivity additives on the thermal stability of composite PCMs. The following figures are TG (Fig. 7a) and DTG (Fig. 7b) of OD, OD/SiC-5 and OD/SiC/EG-5. It can be found that the curves of the three samples were very similar. As the temperature increases, the mass loss of the three samples in the range of 100 °C to 500 °C showed only one stage. The TG curve of OD/SiC/EG was located on the right side of OD and OD/SiC. This was because the OD absorbed in the SiC/EG grading pore was difficult to vaporize at the normal boiling point, thus delaying the OD evaporated during TG analysis and improving the thermal stability of the organic PCMs. According to the DTG curves, the maximum weight loss rate of OD occurred when the temperature reached the maximum 285.5 °C, while the maximum weight loss rate of OD/SiC and OD/SiC/EG occurred at 294.8 °C and 298.7 °C respectively, indicating that SiC/EG additives slowed down the thermal decomposition of OD.

3.5. Leakage prevention of OD/SiC/EG
The samples compressed into cylinders (30 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height) were placed in a drying oven at 90 °C (about 30 °C higher than the melting point). Put the filter papers under the samples to absorb the leakage OD, measure and calculate the change of mass loss with time, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. With the increase of SiC/EG, the mass loss of the sample decreased gradually during the heating process. After heating for 1 h, OD/SiC/EG-9 presented the least amount of OD leakage, 4.9%, which showed that SiC/EG can prevent OD leakage to a large extent. However, it was noteworthy that, when the added mass fraction was all 5%, the leakage of OD/SiC/EG-5 was more serious than that of SiC/EG-5, indicating that EG was the main force in the adsorption and encapsulation of OD in OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs, and the addition of SiC did not contribute to the the leak-proof performance.

3.6. Thermal conductivity
Thermal conductivity is another important thermal performance parameter of thermal storage PCMs, which has great influence on the thermal storage efficiency and heat release efficiency during melting and solidification. The thermal conductivity measurements in this study were carried out at 20 °C. As shown in Fig. 10, the low thermal conductivity of pure OD was about 0.415 W·m−1·K−1, and the thermal conductivity of composites added nano-SiC alone was only a little higher than that of pure OD. The thermal conductivity of composites added 9 wt% nano-SiC was only 0.44 W·m−1·K−1. It was found that although nano-SiC processed high thermal conductivity, its addition did not enhance the thermal conductivity of OD. This is due to the agglomeration and uneven distribution of nano-SiC in OD, which made it impossible to form a continuous heat transfer network. There were many differences between thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs with the change of additives. The thermal conductivity of pure OD was 0.415 W·m−1·K−1, while that of OD/SiC, OD/EG and OD/SiC/EG were 0.432, 0.607 and 0.996 W·m−1·K−1 respectively when the mass fraction was all 5 wt%. It can be found that the thermal conductivity of OD enhanced by SiC/EG composite was better than that of SiC and EG. For OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs, the thermal conductivity of composites with 9 wt% SiC/EG was as high as 1.674 W·m−1·K−1, which was more than 4 times that of pure OD. EG acted as a thermal conductive skeleton in the OD/SiC/EG composites. When no SiC was added, the OD was adsorbed on the surface and pores of EG, which may destroy the continuity of the EG skeleton. After adding SiC, SiC was filled in the honeycomb-like pores of EG to support the skeleton structure. In this case, SiC/EG composites can still maintain good continuity and integrity of the skeleton after adsorbing OD. Moreover, due to its ultra-high thermal conductivity, rich hierarchical porous structure and large specific surface area, SiC/EG composites can form the hierarchical heat transfer network structure within OD to transfer heat rapidly, so it can significantly improve the thermal conductivity of OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs.
Fig. 10. The thermal conductivity of pure OD and the prepared composite PCMs.
3.7. Thermal cycle stability
OD/SiC/EG composite thermal storage materials must be stable and reliable in thermal cycle to be applied in practical application. Fig. 11 shows the DSC curves of pure OD and OD/SiC/EG-5 composites after 1, 50 and 100 times of heating-cooling cycles in the temperature range of 30–80 °C. It can be seen that the shape and position of the curves are almost identical before and after the cycles for both pure OD and OD/SiC/EG-5 composites. The latent heat of pure OD before and after thermal cycles were 228.5 J/g and 224.9 J/g, the latent heat loss rate was only 1.6%, and the phase transition temperature was changed by 1.3 °C; the latent heat of OD/SiC/EG-5 composites before and after thermal cycles were 211.2 J/g and 203.7 J/g, the latent heat loss rate was only 3.6%, and the phase transition temperature was changed by 2.1 °C. Given all that, the addition of SiC/EG did not change the phase transition behavior of the heat storage material, nor did it reduce the thermal stability. Even after many thermal cycles, OD/SiC/EG-5 composites still possessed higher latent heat and suitable phase change temperature, which indicated that OD/SiC/EG-5 composites had perfect thermal stability and great advantages for heat storage application.

4. Conclusions
A series of composite PCMs were successfully prepared by using SiC, EG and SiC/EG composite as thermal conductive enhancement phase and OD as phase change heat storage material. The effects of different additives on the thermal properties of OD PCMs were also investigated. The results of SEM, XRD and FTIR analysis confirmed that SiC was successfully attached to EG, and SiC/EG and OD were well physically combined. The effect of additives on the phase transition temperature and latent heat of OD was not significant. OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs had suitable phase change temperature, larger phase transition enthalpy and perfect thermal stability. The phase change temperature, latent heat of enthalpy and thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs with 5 wt% SiC/EG were 58.6 °C, 211.2 J/g and 0.996 W·m−1·K−1, respectively. Compared with SiC and EG, SiC/EG composite can improve the thermal conductivity of composite organic PCMs better. OD/SiC/EG composite PCMs processed good thermal stability, high thermal conductivity and high energy storage density, which was a new promising material in the field of solar thermal storage system, thermal comfort clothing and waste heat recovery by acting as a thermal storage battery.
