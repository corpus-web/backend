1. Introduction
To meet the growing demands for portable electronic devices and hybrid plug-in electric vehicles, more and more attentions in recent years have been paid to develop lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with high capacity, high-rate capability and long cycle life [1,2]. Graphitized carbon has been widely applied as an anode material in LIBs due to its low cost and low lithium insertion potential. However, the limited theoretical capacity (372 mAh g−1 for LiC6) and poor rate capability cannot satisfy its further application in high energy and high power densities LIBs [3,4]. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to developing novel carbonaceous anode materials with large Li-ion storage capacity and high rate capability.
Recently, several carbonaceous materials with three-dimensional (3D) porous network have been widely regarded as anode materials for LIBs [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. The high performances of porous carbons were mainly attributed to the large specific surface area and conductive 3D porous network. Large specific surface area provides large surface interface between the electrode and electrolyte for rapid Li-ion diffusion and fast charge transfer reaction [10,11]. The 3D porous network provides shortened pathways for Li-ion diffusion in the carbon electrode and improves the reaction kinetics, which may result in the enhancement of rate capability and cycling performance [12,13]. Meanwhile, a porous structure possessing a hierarchical pore network (interconnected micro-, meso- and macropores) was conductive to serving as a reservoir for Li-ion storage and continuous channels for electron transportation [9,14]. In addition, heteroatom modification was regarded as another strategy to enhance the electrochemical performances of the carbon-base materials. Among various heteroatoms doping, N doped carbons were attractive because of its higher electronegativity compared with that of C atom (3.5 for N, 3.0 for C) [15]. N doping into the carbon matrix can be beneficial to the formation of more active sites and a strong interaction between Li+ and the N doped carbon material, which greatly enhanced the Li+ storage capacity and electrochemical reactivity [16,17]. Beside N atom, oxygen also plays an important role in improving the properties of carbon materials due to the surface redox reaction between Li-ions and surface oxygen-containing functional groups (such as carbonyl), via the reaction of –C=O + Li++e− → -C-O-Li [18,19]. Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop high-performance carbon materials possessing 3D porosity and appropriate heteroatom functionalities.
To date, conventional methods for synthesizing porous carbon materials mainly include chemical activation (such as KOH) and silica template method [16,20,21]. The former method involves the reaction of KOH and carbon precursor, which may corrode the tubes used in the tube furnace [22]. The latter method was related to SiO2 template, which was removed by toxic hydrofluoric acid and the fabrication process of SiO2 was complex and time-consuming [23]. Hence, developing a novel, facile and environment-protecting approach for high performance carbon-based anode materials is still challenging.
Filter paper, an abundant source of nature, is rich in cellulose with many hydroxyl groups and its high liquid absorption capacity is beneficial for the preparation of the 3D porous carbons. In this work, we have developed a novel and facile strategy to fabricate hierarchically porous nitrogen, oxygen-rich carbons through treatment with Mg(NO3)2 applying filter paper as the carbon precursor. This filter paper derived hierarchically nitrogen, oxygen-rich porous carbon was used as anode material for LIBs, showing an excellent reversible capacity (1560 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior rate capability (501 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) and desired cycling performance (1538 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 1105 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1after 100 cycles). Moreover, a full battery with an obtained carbon anode and a LiFePO4 cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 165 mAh g−1 at 0.1C (the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4 was 170 mAh g−1, 1C = 170 mA g−1), and good cyclability (156 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles at 0.1C). The mechanism of the Mg(NO3)2 for heteroatom doping carbons was further investigated. Surprisingly, Mg(NO3)2, which can not only act as a pore-making agent by absorbing the Mg(NO3)2 solution into the internal cellulose of filter paper, but also contribute to introducing heteroatom doping effects by the decomposition of Mg(NO3)2 into the NO2. The excellent electrochemical performances and environmental friendly may greatly promote practical application of this filter paper derived carbon in high performance LIBs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials fabrication
Firstly, the filter paper (purchased from Kelong Chemical Industrial Corporation, Sichuan, China) was cut into small pieces (2 cm in length and 1 cm in width) and dried at 60 °C for 4 h to remove its surface water. 1, 2 and 4 g magnesium nitrate were dissolved in 3 ml of tertiary distilled water to form homogeneous solutions, respectively. The dried filter paper is completely impregnated in the above magnesium nitrate solutions so that filter paper can absorb magnesium nitrate as much as possible. The as-obtained mixture was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight and was then sintered at 700 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere in the tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Finally, the pyrolysis product was treated in 1 M HCl for 24 h, washed with distilled water until neutral and dried at 90 °C under vacuum overnight. The mass ratio of filter paper and magnesium nitrate was 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4, denoted as FPC-1, FPC-2 and FPC-4, respectively. For comparison, the filter paper without treated by magnesium nitrate was directly carbonized at 700 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere in the tube furnace and the obtained product was denoted as FPC-0.
2.2. Material characterization
The samples were studied by X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). Raman spectra were recorded using Laser Confocal Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon, LabRAM HR800). The N2 absorption and desorption of the as-prepared carbons was performed applying Automated Gas Sorption Analyzer (Autosorb-IQ, USA). Chemical state of the element was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, a Kratos XSAM 800 spectrometer, Manchester, UK). The morphological structures of the as-obtained carbons were conducted using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 20, USA). Organic functional groups of the as-fabricated carbons were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, NICOLET 5700 FT-IR Spectrometer, USA). Thermogravimetric (TG, Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer, Q500, USA) analysis was performed to study the mass loss of the carbon samples.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The slurry was made by mixing active carbon material with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and acetylene black (AB) at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The obtained slurry was coated on the copper foil and dried in vacuum at 100 °C for 4 h to remove the solvent. After drying, the foil was cut into small disks (16 mm in diameter). The mass loading the active material was around 1.2–1.5 mg cm−2. Coin cells of 2032 were assembled in the Ar-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). Lithium foil was used as the counter electrode and a 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1 was used as the electrolyte. The assembled cells were charged and discharged between 0.01 V and 3 V in the Neware CT 3008 tester at the room temperature of 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was performed on the CHI650E at various rate scans between 0.01 V and 3 V. The Electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectrum was conducted on an electrochemical workstation of CHI650E with the frequency range of 10 mHz and 100KHz.
The full cells (coin cells of 2032) were constructed by coupling the FPC-2 anode with as-prepared LiFePO4 cathode. The preparation of LiFePO4 can be seen in our previous work [24]. The LiFePO4 electrode was made by mixing the active material of LiFePO4, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and acetylene black (AB) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in NMP solvent on the Al foil and dried at 120 °C. It should be noted that the mass loading of the anode was about 1 mg cm−2 and the mass loading of the cathode was about 10 mg cm−2 (According to the balance principle of positive and negative electrodes (m1 × C1 = m2 × C2, m1 is the mass loading of the cathode electrode, C1 is the discharge capacity of the cathode electrode, m2 is the mass loading of the anode electrode, C2 is the reversible capacity of the anode electrode). The diameter and size of electrode is about 14 mm for cathode and 16 mm for anode. 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1 was used as the electrolyte and Celgard 2400 was used as the separator. The full cells were assembled in the glove box and tested in the potential range of 0.9 and 3.9 V at the current density of 0.1C (1C = 170 mA g−1).
3. Results and discussions
As an abundant natural resource in the earth, filter paper is rich in cellulose and delivers an excellent adsorptive capacity, which is beneficial for the fabrication of the 3D porous carbons. The synthetic steps for filter paper derived porous carbons can be illustrated in Fig. 1a, which involving the full adsorption of the magnesium nitrate and the removal of the magnesium oxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the crystalline phase of the as-fabricated carbons. Fig. 1b displays similar diffraction features for carbon samples. Two peaks located at 23.8° and 43.2° can be ascribed to the (002) and (100) behavior of graphitic carbon, respectively [25]. These peaks are greatly broadened and weak, revealing the amorphous structure of the as-prepared carbon. Meanwhile, using the Bragg's formula (d(002) = λ/2sinθ) [26], the interlayer spacing of d(002) plane can be calculated to be 0.373 nm, which is larger than that of graphite (0.335 nm). These amorphous structure and large interlayer spacing are both beneficial for lithium ion insertion and extraction [27]. A typical characteristic D-band (disordered carbon and defective) and G-band (graphitic carbon) of carbon can be analyzed by Raman spectra. As shown in Fig. 1c, two obvious peaks located at 1326 cm−1 and 1584 cm−1 were attributed to D-band, G-band, respectively [28]. The intensity ratios of the D-band to G-band (ID/IG) were estimated to be 0.94, 0.97, 1.01 and 0.98 for FPC-0, FPC-1, FPC-2 and FPC-4, respectively, suggesting more defects in the porous carbon samples with Mg(NO3)2 treatment. To further study the pore characteristics of the as-obtained carbons, N2 absorption/desorption experiment was conducted. As displayed in Fig. 1d, the FPC-0 shows a low N2 absorption capacity, indicating a non-porous characteristic, while the carbons with Mg(NO3)2 treatment show type I/IV isotherms. Taking FPC-2 as an example, a large absorption was observed at a low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.1), revealing a microporous behavior. Meanwhile, the obvious hysteresis loop appeared at the relative pressure (from 0.5 < P/P0 < 0.9) reveals the existence of mesopores in the carbons. Moreover, the high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.9) suggested the formation of some macropores. According to the (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller) BET method, the specific surface areas were determined to be 323, 770, 1031, and 923 m2 g−1 for the samples FPC-0, FPC-1, FPC-2 and FPC-4, respectively. The corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 1e) of the samples were estimated by density functional theory (DFT), and especially the samples with Mg(NO3)2 treatment mainly show the interconnection of micropores and mesopores. Small amount of macropores can also be observed in the carbon, which may be originated from the randomly arranged carbon sheets [29]. The specific surface area, pore volume and other physical parameters of the as-obtained carbons were summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the carbons with the treatment of the different Mg(NO3)2 contents delivers different pore structure. Specifically, the as-obtained carbons without treated by Mg(NO3)2 show low pore volume (micropore volume is 0.117 cm3 g−1 and mesopore volume is 0.021 cm3 g−1). With the increase of the Mg(NO3)2 content, the pore structures of the as-prepared carbons has changed obviously. The volumes of micro-, mesopore are 0.301 and 0.268 cm3 g−1 for FPC-1, 0.395 and 0.611 cm3 g−1 for FPC-2 and 0.387 and 0.436 cm3 g−1 for FPC-4. The FPC-2 displays the largest micro-, mesopore volumes, which indicated that the mass ratio of filter paper and Mg(NO3)2 of 1:2 was favorable to obtain rich pore structures. The average pore sizes of the carbons obtained from Mg(NO3)2 were concentrated at about 2–4 nm. The high specific surface area and hierarchically interconnected pore structure can provide a large electrode/electrolyte surface interface for charge-transfer reaction and a shortened pathway for ion diffusion, resulting in an enhanced rate capability during the charge/discharge process.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations were performed to study the micromorphology of the materials. As displayed in Fig. S1, the filter paper consisting of lignocelluloses shows a long fiber structure, which is beneficial for absorption of the Mg(NO3)2 solution. After pyrolysis at high temperature, the sample FPC-0 (Fig. 2a) shows a clustered structure and no obvious porous feature can be observed. After Mg(NO3)2 treatment, the SEM images of FPC-1, FPC-2, and FPC-4 are depicted in Fig. 2b-d, indicating a porous morphology. With the increase of the concentration of Mg(NO3)2, the sample became more pulverized. Meanwhile, the corresponding element mapping images (Fig. 2e) showed C, N and O elements, which are uniformly distributed in the as-obtained FPC-2. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Fig. S2) further confirmed the existence of the C, N and O elements. The mass ratios were 83.18% for C, 2.34% for N and 14.48% for O, respectively. With such a hierarchical pore structure and N, O dual-functionalization, the as-obtained FPC material could be acted as a potential anode for LIBs due to offering a favorable transportation and extra active sites for the high-capacity storage of Li-ion during charge/discharge process.

The structure and morphology were further studied applying TEM and HRTEM. As displayed in Fig. 3a, a highly porous structure with interconnected pores can be clearly observed in the sample of FPC-2 (the pores are marked by the red arrow). The inset image (the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the as-obtained carbon) displays a typical ring feature (marked by the red arrow), suggesting a typical amorphous feature. This result is consistence with the XRD pattern and Raman spectra in Fig. 1. Fig. 3b clearly shows that the FPC-2 possesses a meso- and macroporous structure (the corresponding area has been marked by the red arrow), which acted as a large reservoir for Li-ion storage. As shown in Fig. 3c, large amount of micropores can be observed in the carbon materials (marked by the red circles).

XPS analysis was conducted to investigate the chemical elements on the surface of the materials. As displayed in Fig. 4a, four carbons delivered two obvious peaks located at 285 and 532 eV, corresponding to C1s and O1s peaks, respectively. After careful observation from the survey spectrum, it was found that the carbons with Mg(NO3)2 treatment show clear peaks at 399 eV (from the dotted line in Fig. 4a), which is attributed to the N1s peaks. The as-obtained carbons with Mg(NO3)2 treatment show three elements of C, N and O, agreeing with the result of EDS (seen in Fig. 2). As shown in Table 1, the nitrogen contents were determined to be 0% for FPC-0, 1.46% for FPC-1, 2.84% for FPC-2 and 1.63% for FPC-4. The existence of nitrogen functionalities may be derived from the effect of the activation of the Mg(NO3)2, which can be discussed in the later section. To specific study the chemical state of the elements of C, N and O, deconvolution of the XPS peaks was carried out. Fig. 4b shows that C1s spectra mainly consist of four components: 284.7 eV for sp2-C with Cdouble bondC bond, 285.8 eV for C-N/C=N groups, 287.5 eV for Csingle bondO groups and 289.2 eV for O-C=O groups [30,31]. N1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4c) can be deconvoluted into obvious two different peaks at 398.8 and 400.2 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, respectively [32,33]. N doping effect is conducive to be beneficial for enhancing the electrode wettability and the electric conductivity, leading to the superior electrochemical properties [34,35]. In addition, the O1s spectra (Fig. 4d) consist of two peaks at 532.1 and 533.3 eV, corresponding to Cdouble bondO and O=C-O, respectively. The oxygen mainly derived from the oxygen-containing groups in the carbon materials instead of the absorbed water on the surface. The high oxygen content (13.82%) in FPC-2 may have important effects on the enhancement of the electrochemical performances of the carbon-based materials due to surface redox reaction between Li+ and surface oxygen functional groups (by the reaction, –C=O + Li++e− → -C-O-Li). [18,19] N, O dual-doping effect in the carbon matrix may provide more active sites and improve the interaction between the carbon structure and Li-ion during the intercalation and de-intercalation [18,36].

To further investigate the effect of Mg(NO3)2 as MgO-template precursor on N introduction and pore-making, Mg(CH3COO)2 without nitrogen element was used for comparison. The compared carbons were fabricated by Mg(CH3COO)2 treatment under the same condition with that of Mg(NO3)2 treatment. Fig. 5a showed the XRD patterns of the materials derived from the pyrolysis of the Mg(NO3)2 and Mg(CH3COO)2 at 700 °C under Ar atmosphere. A high pure peak of MgO can be observed (According to the PDF Card # 04–001-7295), indicating that two kinds of magnesium salts were converted into MgO at high temperature pyrolysis. Filter paper is rich in cotton fibers, which is composed of C, H and O elements. The nitrogen doping effect in the carbon materials can be analyzed by thermogravimetric (TG) of magnesium salts and surface elements detection of XPS spectra. As depicted in Fig. 5b, two samples of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O and Mg(CH3COO)2 decomposed at about 300–400 °C during the carbonization process, which may be ascribed to the formation of the MgO [37]. It should be pointed out that the difference between Mg(NO3)2 and Mg(CH3COO)2 for the pore-creating may derive from the gas generated during carbonization. Fig. 5c displayed the XPS spectra of the carbon materials with Mg(CH3COO)2 treatment and the main elements were determined to be C and O. No nitrogen doping effect was detected and the deconvolution of the C1s and O1s can be seen in the Fig. S3. In addition, FTIR spectroscopy was further applied to confirm the existence of the N in the as-obtained FPC-2 treated by Mg(NO3)2 and can be seen in Fig. 5d. The peak at 3413 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Osingle bondH stretching vibrations. N functionalities can be proved by the two peaks: 1230 cm−1 for the Csingle bondN stretching vibration) and 1585 cm−1 (corresponding to pyridinic N or pyrrolic N groups) [38,39]. From the above analysis, the difference of two magnesium salts for the porous carbons was the generation of some nitrogen oxides in the Mg(NO3)2 system. During the Mg(NO3)2 treatment, MgO acts as a porosity-making agent, by absorbing a Mg(NO3)2 solution into filter paper with subsequent drying and pyrolysis process. For the same heating rating of 5 °C min−1, the FPC-2 delivers N doping effect. The reason can be attributed to some nitrogen oxides produced from the decomposition of Mg(NO3)2. The mechanism of Mg(NO3)2 for the N doping can be illustrated in Fig. 5e. The NO2 was generated during the pyrolysis of the Mg(NO3)2 and can penetrate into the carbon skeleton, leading to the improvement of the nitrogen functionalization. Therefore, the Mg(NO3)2 can act as multifunctional agent for pore-making and N doping effect.

Owing to the unique hierarchical porous structure and favorable N, O dual doping effect, the as-fabricated carbon materials can be further tested as the anode materials for LIBs. Fig. 6a delivers the charge/discharge profiles of FPC-0 at a current density 0f 0.1 A g−1 between 0.01 and 3 V. The discharge capacity in the initial cycle is 414 mAh g−1 and the reversible capacity is 243 mAh g−1. After 10 cycles, the reversible capacity decreased to 217 mAh g−1. With the treatment of Mg(NO3)2, the performances of the carbon were significantly enhanced. After 10 cycles, the three carbons show high capacities of 1155, 1560 and 1333 mAh g−1 for FPC-1, FPC-2 and FPC-4, respectively (Fig. 6b, c, d). Therefore, appropriate specific surface area and suitable N, O content were important for the electrochemical performances of the carbon materials. Interestingly, the reversible capacities of three porous carbons raised with the increase of cycling, which may be derived from the activation of the electrode during the repetitive Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation [40,41]. Theses obtained capacities were more than three times higher than that of commercial graphite (the theoretical capacity is 372 mAh g−1). The corresponding initial coulombic efficiencies were calculated to be 61.7% for FPC-1, 63.3% for FPC-2 and 59.8% for FPC-4, which are higher than that of many carbon anodes. The large initial capacity loss is mainly ascribed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and the decomposition of the electrolyte [11] [42,43]. Although the large irreversible capacity loss can be seen in the first cycle, the coulombic efficiencies were quickly enhanced in the sequent cycles. For FPC-2, the coulombic efficiency increases dramatically to 96% after 2 cycles. This result suggested that the filter paper derived nitrogen, oxygen-rich porous carbon would show great potential for its widespread commercialized application in high-performance LIBs.

The rate capabilities of the FPC-2 at different charge/discharge current densities (from 0.1 to 5 A g−1 with 10 cycles at each rate) are displayed in Fig. 7a. A stable reversible capacities can be achieved: 1560 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 1529 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 1305 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 1096 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 640 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1. Even at high rate of 5 A g−1(13.4C, 1C = 372 mA g−1), the carbon electrode still shows superior reversible capacity of 501 mAh g−1. When the current density recovered to 0.1 A g−1, a favorable capacity of 1529 mAh g−1 can be obtained. The corresponding coulombic efficiencies after initial cycle were above 95%. Meanwhile, the cycling performances of the as-prepared carbon were evaluated at current densities of 0.1 A g−1 and 1 A g−1. At 0.1 A g−1, the reversible capacity is increased from 1401 mA h g−1 to 1549 mAh g−1 between 45 and 90 cycles due to the gradual activation of carbon electrode during the charge/discharge processes. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the delayed wetting of the electrolyte into the carbon electrode and activation of the carbon electrode [44,45]. After 100 cycles (Fig. 7b), the carbon materials show high reversible capacities of 1538 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. While a capacity of 1105 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 was obtained after 100 cycles. These results further indicate the excellent cycling stability of the as-achieved anode. The EIS spectra were further carried out to investigate the kinetic activity during the cycling process. According to the equivalent circuit, Rs was related to the solution resistance; Rf corresponds to the SEI film resistance for Li-ion penetration; Rct was the charge transfer resistance; Zw was the warburg impedance attributed to the Li-ion diffusion process and C1, C2 were the insertion capacitances [46,47]. As shown in Fig. 7c, the carbon displayed a smaller semicircle after 100 cycles compared to that of before cycling. The calculated charge transfer resistance (Rct) was 20 Ω after 100 cycles, which is much smaller that of before cycling (90 Ω). This result indicates that the carbon electrode in this work is beneficial to fast Li-ion diffusion and fast charge transfer at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode. In addition, the as-assembled coin-type lithium ion battery was able to lighten light-emitting-diode (LED) transistor (Fig. 7d), which show the practical application of as-obtained carbon as anode in LIBs.

Capacitive behavior of the carbon materials is favorable to the enhancement of their cycling performances and rate capability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis (after 10 cycles) at different scan rates (0.1–1.6 mV s−1) for LIBs was further conducted to study the capacitive properties in FPC-2. As displayed in Fig. 8a, when the scan rate is increased, the CV curves deliver similar shapes without obvious redox peaks. When the active material possesses high specific surface area, the capacitive contribution can be calculated at various scan rates by the power law [48,49], i = m nv, Log i = n log v + log m. In these two formulas, i is the current density, v is the scan rate, and m and n are the changeable parameters. According to the previous works, if the b-value is 0.5, it reveals a diffusion process in the electrochemical reaction. However, if the value of b is close to 1, it suggests that the electrochemical process is mainly controlled by the capacitive effect. Fig. 8b shows the Log i vs. Log v relationship for FPC-2. The b-value was calculated to be 0.79, suggesting that the surface-limited capacitive behavior plays a pivotal role on Li-ion storage. This phenomenon is consistence with the previous work [50]. Furthermore, the CV curves (after 10 cycles) at different scan rates (0.1–1.6 mV s−1) also show the similar shapes without obvious redox peaks with the increase of the scan rates (Fig. S4a-b). The corresponding b values of the as-obtained FPC-1 and FPC-4 (Fig.S4c-d) were determined to be 0.81 and 0.76, respectively, suggesting a capacitive effect in the electrochemical reaction. In addition, the EIS spectra of the FPC-1 and FPC-4 (Fig. S4e-f) also show a smaller semicircle after 50 cycles compared to that of before cycling, indicating the activated electrodes is conducive to the electrochemical reaction with the repeated intercalation and extraction of the lithium ions. To further confirm practical potential of the as-fabricated porous carbons in LIBs, a full lithium ion battery was assembled by using the FPC-2 as the anode and LiFePO4 as the cathode. The LiFePO4 was prepared in our previous work [24]. The mass ratio of FPC-2 to LiFePO4 was determined to be about 1:4. Fig. 8c depicted the first, the second and the 20th charge/discharge curves of the FPC-2/LiFePO4 full battery at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 170 mA g−1) between 0.9 and 3.9 V(vs. Li+/Li). Based on the active mass of cathode, the initial discharge capacity of this full battery was 165 mAh g−1 (the first cycle efficiency was about 90.6%), which is close to that of LiFePO4 in half battery in our previous result [24]. After the lithiation process of the anode, the battery shows superior discharge capacities of 162 mAh g−1 (2 cycles) and 156 mAh g−1 (20 cycles). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8c, the full cells with LiFePO4 as cathode and as-obtained carbon as anode deliver a clear discharge plateau in the voltage of about 3.2 V. It is generally known that the LiFePO4 cathode possesses a theoretical capacity of 170 mAh g−1 and a stable charging and discharging plateau of 3.4 V. Fig. 6c shows the charge/discharge profiles of the as-prepared carbons in the voltage between 0.01 and 3 V, indicating that most of the capacity is concentrated in the lower voltage of 0.5 V. A plateau in about 0.2 V was appeared in the potential profile. Thus, an obvious plateau of 3.2 V in the full cell can be obtained according to the difference between cathode and anode voltage plateau. Fig. 8d shows that the as-assembled full battery delivers stable capacity retention during the 20 charge/discharge cycles. It should be pointed out that the low potential region can be attributed to the Li extraction from the graphene layers and the extended sloping potential region corresponds to the extraction of abundant lithium ions from defects in the carbon electrodes, such as pores, edges in the obtained electrode [51,52]. Due to the porous structures and N doping in the as-obtained carbons, the sloping potential region has been extended, which limited its applicability in the full cells. Thus, as shown in Fig. 8c, the charge/discharge plateau was formed in the voltage of about 3.2 V. The general strategy for improving the performance of the anode in the full cell is to shorten the sloping potential region and increase the low voltage plateau region. Therefore, increasing the graphitization degree and decreasing the pore structure in the carbon anodes in our future work may be an effective way to improving the performances of the full cells. Specifically, increasing the graphitization degree of the carbons can be beneficial for the Li extraction from the graphene layers in the low potential region and decreasing the pore structures can contribute to controlling the lithium ion extraction from the defects in the sloping region. From these results, we can see that the FPC-2/LiFePO4 full battery displays a superior electrochemical performance, (such as high discharge specific capacity, favorable cyclability) thus determining the potentiality of FPC-2 as anode materials for LIBs applications.

A comparison of the electrochemical performances of FPC-2 with the carbon-based materials reported in recent years (including wheat straw derived hierarchically porous nitrogen-rich carbon, micro-sized porous carbon spheres derived from corn starch, interconnected highly graphitic carbon nanosheets from wheat stalk, hierarchical porous carbons from rice straws, two-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon derived from soft pitch, nitrogen doped porous carbon from duckweed, porous carbon nanofiber webs from bacterial cellulose, ultra-thin carbon nanosheets from soybean milk, activated carbon from rice husk, hierarchically porous carbon from acrylic fibrous waste) was displayed in Fig. S5. Particularly, the filter paper derived nitrogen, oxygen-rich carbons show the better performances than that of most reported carbons. The superior performances of the as-fabricated carbons can be ascribed to the unique nanostructure with heteroatom doping effects. Firstly, novel hierarchical porosity structure provides sufficient channels for fast Li-ion diffusion and efficient electron transportation, thus obtaining the higher electrochemical activity. Secondly, large amount of pores with interconnected micro-, meso- and macropores not only act as huge reservoirs to improve the capability for Li-ion storage, but also effectively accommodate the volume change during the repetitive Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation processes. Thirdly, small amount of N in the carbon material produces some defects and provide more active sites for Li-ion storage, while rich oxygen-containing functional groups derived from large amount of O contributes to enhancing the storage capacity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported a facile strategy to fabricate a hierarchically porous nitrogen, oxygen-rich carbon material via Mg(NO3)2-synergetic pyrolysis of filter paper. As anode material for LIBs, the as-fabricated FPC-2 delivers high reversible capacity (1560 mAh g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1), superior rate capability (501 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) and desired cycling performance (1538 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 1105 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 100 cycles). The excellent performances can be attributed to the large specific surface area (1031 m2 g−1) with interconnected micro-, meso- and macropores and N, O functiontities. Furthermore, the full lithium ion battery comprising a FPC-2 anode and a LiFePO4 cathode shows high initial discharge capacity of 165 mAh g−1 at 0.1C (the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4 was 170 mAh g−1), and good cyclability (156 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles at 0.1C). Apart from the high performance for LIBs, the mechanism of Mg(NO3)2 for the preparation of N doped porous carbons was analyzed. Mg(NO3)2 not only acts as pore-making template for porous structural, but also contributes to introducing N doping into the carbon matrix, showing that the Mg(NO3)2 was dual functional. This work may offer a new strategy to fabricate high performance carbon material with high porosity and rich heteroatom doping.
