ABSTRACT
To investigate what happened in reality during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, the phenomena within reactor pressure vessel and the discussion of ties with the environmental monitoring measurement are very important. However, the previous study that treats phenomena of the both has not necessarily advanced up to the present time. The source terms predicted by simulation codes such as MELCOR has not yet been consistent with the reverse estimation by WSPEEDI code using environmental measurement data. This study investigated 131I and 137Cs release behaviors during the late phase of the accident to contribute to such examination using the 131I/137Cs ratio of the new source terms predicted by Katata. The 131I release by the gas–liquid partition from the contaminated water in the 1F2 and 1F3 reactor buildings which was pointed out in the previous study was reevaluated using the new source terms. In addition, paying attention to the similarity of the core conditions between the Fukushima accident and the Phébus FPT3 experiment using the B4C control rods, the release of organic iodine (CH3I) during the 1F3 suppression pool venting, formation of CsBO2 and its release behavior were examined which have not yet been sufficiently studied so far.

1. Introduction
In an evaluation of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident, hereafter the Fukushima accident, understanding the phenomena that occurred in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and discussing its ties with environmental monitoring measurement are important. Individual studies on the thermo-hydraulic phenomena in the RPV [1] and radiological dispersion in the environment [2] were performed after the accident but a study that treats both phenomena in gross has not necessarily been conducted in the six years after the accident.
Thus far, many examinations of 131I and 137Cs source terms during the Fukushima accident have been conducted, mainly using the two methods. One is estimation from thermo-hydraulic characteristics and analyses of radionuclides release and transport [3] within the RPV and the containment vessel (CV) using severe accident analysis codes such as MELCOR. The other is reverse estimation [4] using an atmospheric dispersion simulation code such as WSPEEDI combined with environmental monitoring data, hereafter WSPEEDI reverse.
The RPV simulation results of past examinations have not yet been adequately consistent with the environmental measurement results. Concerning the cumulative releases of 131I and 137Cs, the results of both methods are in reasonable agreement with each other, as shown in Figure 1. The MELCOR calculation was deemed complete on 17 March because there was no more meaningful release from the core while WSPEEDI reverse evaluated continued release until the beginning of April, leading to a clear difference between the results of both methods.
Figure 1. Comparison of source terms for the Fukushima accident predicted by various methods.
A study [5] by Hidaka showed that the discrepancy of 131I release during the late phase of the Fukushima accident could be explained mainly by the following reasons. MELCOR did not treat a release model from the accumulated water in the basement of the 1F2 and 1F3 reactor buildings due to gas–liquid partition based on Henry's law and steam generation by decay heat.
In the previous study, 131I and 137Cs source terms prepared by Terada [6] were used. However, ‘new source terms’ were recently published by Katata [2] considering the radionuclide amount delivered by wind blowing from land to sea, which was estimated from sea surface concentration. The new source terms predicted an increase in the total cumulative releases of 131I and 137Cs by 10%–20% compared with those reported by Terada (see Figure 1) and a more detailed 131I/137Cs ratio of their release rates (Bq/hr) (see Figure 2).
Figure 2. 131I/137Cs ratio during the Fukushima accident predicted by the new source terms.
Therefore, in this study, 131I release from the contaminated water during the late phase (after 17 March) was reevaluated using the new source terms. In addition, by paying attention to the similarity of the core conditions between the Fukushima accident and the Phébus FPT3 experiment conducted using B4C control rods [7], the release of organic iodine, e.g. methyl iodide (CH3I) during the venting of the 1F3 suppression pool was estimated preliminarily. Further examinations were focused on the chemical form and release behavior of 137Cs during the Fukushima accident, which had not yet been sufficiently studied.
2. 131I/137Cs ratio
The release rates of 131I and 137Cs predicted using WSPEEDI reverse are shown in Figure 3 and are equal to the radioactivity, Bq, number actually released to the environment. In the Katata's study, the chemical and physical forms of 131I were assumed to be particulate iodine, gaseous I2 and gaseous CH3I, respectively, while no forms were assumed for Cs. When the 131I/137Cs ratio was calculated, the radioactivity levels of the three 131I forms were added up. The ratio of particulate 131I to the gaseous form was determined by the monitoring data at Tokai [8], and the fraction of CH3I was determined by assuming that 60% of all the gaseous iodine was CH3I and 40% was I2.
Figure 3. Release rates of 131I and 137Cs predicted by WSPEEDI reverse.
The 131I/137Cs ratio based on these forms would be approximately equal to 10 just after the accident initiation if the volatility of 131I and 137Cs were assumed to be mostly the same because the core inventory of Cs is larger by about one order of magnitude than that of iodine [9], as given in Table 1, while the specific radioactivity of Cs is smaller by about two orders of magnitude than that of iodine.
Table 1. Plant parameters and inventories for 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3.
The 131I/137Cs ratio (see Figure 2) increased temporarily to more than 10 between 15 March and 16 March. This corresponds to the timing of the 1F3 suppression pool venting. It is considered that the gaseous iodine (CH3I) formed within the RPV under relatively elevated temperatures could have been released to the environment. The details are discussed in Section 5.
The 131I/137Cs ratio increased on 21 March and between 23 March and 28 March. Meanwhile, the state of excess 131I release continued. This excess release could be explained by 131I release from the contaminated water in the basements of 1F2 and 1F3 reactor buildings because of the gas–liquid partition of 131I and steam generation due to evaporation of the accumulated water by decay heat. The details are described in Section 3.
A decrease in the 131I/137Cs ratio due to excess 137Cs release was found on 21 March and 29 March. The timing corresponds roughly to the increase in core temperature due to the temporal shortage of core cooling water. This can be explained by the increase in the vapor pressure of CsBO2 at the time of the core temperature increase. The details are described in Section 4.
After the beginning of April, the 131I/137Cs ratio decreased gradually mainly because of the radioactive decay of 131I (half-life: 8.02 days). The broken line in Figure 2 shows the 131I/137Cs ratio when the radioactive decay of 131I and 137Cs (half-life: 30.17 years) is considered assuming that the release fractions of 131I and 137Cs into the environment over the core inventory are the same. It is impossible to say whether the duration when the 131I/137Cs ratio is larger than the broken line corresponds to excess 131I release because the release rates or volatilities of 131I and 137Cs are not necessarily equal.
3. Reevaluation of 131I release from the contaminated water in the basements of 1F2 and 1F3 reactor buildings
In a previous study [5], the release of 131I from the contaminated water in the basements of the 1F2 and 1F3 reactor buildings was assumed to have started on 17 March, while in this study, this date was changed to 21 March based on the new source terms. This is because the 131I/137Cs ratio of the new source terms increased after 21 March, and the Japanese government's report to IAEA [10] (see pages IV-58 and IV-71) states that the release of grayish smoke from the 1F3 reactor building was witnessed at 15:55 on 21 March and the release of white haze-like smoke from the 1F2 reactor building was also witnessed at 18:20 on 21 March. These release times of these smokes are considered the times of commencement of 131I release from the contaminated water.
By contrast, the termination of 131I release from the contaminated water was set to be 28 March based on the 131I/137Cs ratio in this study because excess 131I release by the new source terms continued up to 28 March. Notably, the termination date in the previous study was 26 March because 131I release decreased on that day when the core cooling water in 1F2 was changed from seawater to pure water.
Based on the new source terms, the amount of 131I released from the contaminated water was reevaluated by using formula (1), which is the same method as the previous study [5]. It was assumed that 131I release could occur with the same fractional release rate as 137Cs as a function of core temperature and that the excess 131I release is caused by the release from the contaminated water.
@(1)
where I1: cumulative release of 131I at the beginning of release from the contaminated water = 1.35 × 1017 Bq, I2: cumulative release of 131I at the end of release from the contaminated water = 1.49 × 1017 Bq, C1: cumulative release of 137Cs at the beginning of release from the contaminated water = 1.29 × 1016 Bq, C2: cumulative release of 137Cs at the end of release from the contaminated water = 1.33 × 1016 Bq and IT: total cumulative release of 131I = 1.51 × 1017 Bq.
Reevaluation showed that about 6.5% of the total 131I source term could be attributed to the release from the contaminated water although the previous study evaluated it to be about 35%. Uncertainties included in this study may be larger than those in the previous study because the differences in the cumulative releases of 131I and 137Cs between the two dates are smaller than those in the previous study.
Possible reasons for the smaller estimate than that of the previous study are as follows: (1) onset of 131I release from the reactor buildings which originated from the contaminated water was delayed by four days compared with that in the previous study, and some amount of 131I released from the contaminated water for four days could be deposited onto the basement wall or be dissolved again in the water, and (2) comparing the new source terms with those by Terada or other researchers [11], the new source terms led to higher estimates of 131I and 137Cs release rates between 17 March and 19 March when the wind blew from land to sea (see Figure 3). By contrast, the new source terms led to lower estimates of 131I and 137Cs release rates between 21 March and 28 March. Therefore, the present reevaluation may have estimated lower 131I release from the contaminated water than the previous study. The prediction accuracy of the new source terms when the wind blows from land to sea is discussed in chapter 5.
4. CsBO2 release
4.1. Decay heat and heat removal by core cooling water
The decrease in the 131I/137Cs ratio, which is the excess of 137Cs release, predicted on 21 March and 31 March is examined in this chapter.
After the cooling down of the 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3 reactor cores on 16 March, TEPCO operators tried to find the appropriate amount of water injection by changing the flow rate while controlling the increase in the contaminated water. However, this unexpectedly resulted in a temporal shortage of the core cooling water and an increase in the core temperature of the 1F3 RPV shell flange up to 832 K from 21 March to 23 March [12]. Owing to the same reason, the measured temperature of the 1F1 safety valve exhaust reached 673 K from 21 March to 23 March, and the measured temperature of the 1F2 upper CRD housing increased up to 835 K from 28 March to 30 March.
TEPCO conducted measurements at about 10 points of the core regions at 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3, respectively [12]. The maximum core temperature is plotted in Figure 4 to understand the rough trends in the core temperatures, and its digital values are listed in Table 2. Generally, the temperature at the same point should be used, but this is not the case in this study owing to considerable malfunction in the measurement and the lack of availability of some of the digital values.
Figure 4. Maximum temperature measured at core regions during the late phase of the Fukushima accident.
Table 2. Maximum temperatures measured at core region at 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3.
The increase in core temperature from 21 March to 23 March and from 28 March to 31 March can be explained by a comparison between the decay heat of each reactor and heat removal by the flow rate of core cooling water. For simplicity, heat removal by cooling water was assumed equal to the heat necessary for evaporation of water injected into the core.
The decay heat was calculated using the Borst-Wheeler correlation given in formula @(2).
@(2)
where Qd: decay heat (W), t: time after reactor shutdown (s), t0: duration of operation (s) and Q0: rated thermal power (W).
The parameter values used in the calculation are listed in Table 1. Heat removal was calculated from the heat of evaporation, 2,256,900 (J/kg) multiplied by flow rate of the water injected into the core. It should be noted that all water could not be necessarily used for heat removal from the core because the core configuration could become complex after melting. Accordingly, the present estimation could provide the minimum core cooling flow rate, and the actual minimum core cooling flow rate could be slightly larger than the value obtained in the present calculation.
A comparison between the decay heats of 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3 and heat removal from them by the injected core cooling water [13] is shown in Figures 5–7. These results coincide with the results obtained by Tanabe [14]. Heat removal from 1F1 and 1F3 was lower than the corresponding decay heats from 21 March to 23 March. Heat removal from 1F2 was lower than the decay heat from 28 March to 31 March. These periods correspond to the increases in the core temperatures.

Figure 6. Comparison between 1F2 decay heat and heat removal by core cooling water.
Figure 7. Comparison between 1F3 decay heat and heat removal by core cooling water.
The temperature of the 1F2 core also increased from 11 April to 13 April despite higher heat removal by cooling water than the decay heat. A probable reason is that the core was not cooled sufficiently due its complex shape after melting.
4.2. Formation of CsBO2 and release
The control rods of the 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3 reactors were composed of the B4C powder coated with stainless steel (SS) and were arranged in cruciate. If B4C comes into contacts with SS, the rods would be liquefied by the resulting eutectic reaction at about 1500 K [15], which is lower than the melting point of B4C or SS. Therefore, B4C could be oxidized easily under severe accident conditions and/or could react chemically with 131I and 137Cs.
When a severe accident occurs in a pressurized water reactort (PWR) with silver–indium–cadmium (SIC) control rods, the molybdenum (Mo) generated by nuclear fission could react with Cs, and the formation of Cs2MoO4 would enhance Cs deposition onto reactor coolant system (RCS). Thereafter, Cs2MoO4 could react with water and change to CsOH [16], which was considered the representative chemical form of Cs in previous studies.
By contrast, in the case of a severe accident in a PWR with B4C control rods, as in the Phébus FPT3 test, Cs could be consumed by the formation of CsBO2, resulting in the formation of a lower amount of Cs2MoO4 formation [17]. Notably, the possibility of CsBO2 formation under various light water reactor (LWR) severe accident conditions with B4C absorbers has been confirmed already by many thermochemical equilibrium calculations based on the minimization of Gibbs free energy [18] and other experiments [19].
The possible chemical reactions are as follows [20]. The physical property data of the related chemical compounds and alloy are given in Table 3. The standard reaction enthalpies, ΔHr in formulas (3)–(15), were calculated from the standard formation enthalpies, ΔHf, of chemical compounds [21,22], which are given in Table 4.
@(3)
@(4)
@(5)
Then, boron oxide (B2O3) can react with CsOH or CsI [23], which are the most probable chemical forms of 131I and 137Cs in an RPV or a CV during severe accidents, to form cesium metaborate (CsBO2) [24].

@(7)
@(8)
@(9)
Table 3. Physical properties of chemical compounds and alloy.
Table 4. Standard formation enthalpy of chemical compounds [21,22].
Between the reactions given by formulas (7) and (8), that of formula (8) is more promising because there could be little oxygen in the steam atmosphere within an RPV under severe accident conditions. By contrast, although formulas (6) and (8) represent endothermic reactions, formula (6) is more promising because the endothermic energy of formula (6) is smaller than that of formula (8). That is, CsBO2 would be likely formed by the reaction with CsOH rather than that with CsI.
When the temperature rises to over 1500 K, B4C, B2O3 or CsBO2 could melt and relocate downward under the condition that a part of it is taken in the molten SS and is immediately cooled and solidified in the lower part of the RPV [25]. Boron oxide (B2O3) would change to a boric acid such as metabolic acid (HBO2) below 573 K and orthoboric acid (H3BO3) below 373 K.
@(10)
@(11)
The formation of H3BO3 under severe accident conditions has also been confirmed experimentally [26]. When the core temperature increases again by several hundred Kelvin after cooling of the cores, as in the Fukushima accident, additional CsBO2 may be generated according to the following chemical reactions.
@(12)
@(13）
@(14)
@(15)
The exothermic reactions of formulas (14) and (15) are more promising than the endothermic reactions of formulas (12) and (13). This suggests that at the time of re-ascension of the core temperature, additional CsBO2 would likely be generated by the reaction of HBO2 or H3BO3 with CsOH rather than with CsI.
The 131I release rate increased from 23 March to 24 March and from 30 March to 31 March, similar to the increase in the 137Cs release rate (see Figure 3). This could be due to the release of CsI, which has a similar vapor pressure as that of CsBO2 (see Figure 8). However, the decrease in the 131I/137Cs ratio on those days cannot be explained only by the release of CsI. The release of Cs compounds without iodine such as CsBO2 or CsOH could lead to decrease in the 131I/137Cs ratio. It is noted that the release of CsBO2 may be more promising than that of CsOH because most of CsOH in the RPV had been vaporized and transported to outside of the RPV between 11 March and 16 March due to the high vapor pressure, Alternatively, it may have been dissolved in the water in the RPV owing to its high solubility and released to the CV and/or the reactor buildings.
Figure 8. Comparison of vapor pressures of representative Cs compounds.
The equilibrium vapor pressures of CsBO2 calculated from formula (16) [27] at the maximum temperatures measured in each core region are shown in Figure 9.
PCsBO2(Pa)=exp(16)
Figure 9. Vapor pressure of CsBO2 at measured maximum temperature and 131I/137Cs ratio.
Figure 9 shows that the timings of the increase in the equilibrium vapor pressure of CsBO2 mostly agree with those of excess 137Cs release (decrease in 131I/137Cs ratio). It is inferred that the excess 137Cs release from 23 March to 24 March was caused by the release of CsBO2 from 1F1 and 1F3, while that on 31 March was caused by the release of CsBO2 from 1F2.
If all the 137Cs release after 19 March is assumed to be caused by the re-ascension of the core temperature, the ratio of the amount of 137Cs released after 19 March to the total cumulative release of 137Cs reaches about 28% when calculated using the new source terms and about 50% when calculated using Terada's source terms.
4.3. Comparison with environmental radiation monitoring data
As a response to the Fukushima accident, the environmental radiation, such as ambient radiation dose rates, radioactivity concentrations in air and in fallout, and meteorological observations, was monitored from 11 March 2011 to 31 May 2011, at the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Engineering Laboratories, JAEA, in Tokai. According to the report [28], gaseous 137Cs was measured until 29 March but not after 30 March. It is noted that the concentration of particulate 137Cs drastically increased after 30 March.
In this monitoring operation, radionuclide sampling was performed using a HE-40T filter paper measuring 50 mm in diameter (for floating dust sampling in atmosphere) in combination with a CHC-50 charcoal filter (for sampling gaseous iodine sampling in atmosphere). HE-40T can collect the particulates measuring about >0.1 m in diameter, while CHC-50 can collect gaseous iodine or hygroscopic moisture passing through the HE-40T filter paper.
The concentrations of gaseous or particulate 137Cs and 131I in atmosphere measured in Tokai are shown in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. The 131I/137Cs ratio in the fallout measured in the environmental radiation monitoring operation is shown in Figure 12. The trends agree reasonably with the 131I/137Cs ratios predicted using the new source terms, and the environmental radiation monitoring data can be considered to have adequate precision for examining the present issues. The drastic change from gaseous 137Cs to the particulate on 30 March and the abrupt increase in the particulate concentration suggest that some kinds of phenomena occurred within the NPPs.
Figure 10. Concentrations of gaseous or particulate 137Cs in atmosphere measured in Tokai
Figure 11. Concentrations of gaseous or particulate 131I in atmosphere measured in Tokai.
Figure 12. Comparison of 131I/137Cs ratio between the new source terms and fallout measured in environmental radiation monitoring operation.
CsOH could be easily dissolved in water and contained in hygroscopic moisture. By contrast, CsBO2 could likely become particulate in atmosphere compared with CsOH because of the lower vapor pressure of CsBO2 than that of CsOH. Although the vapor pressure of CsI is almost the same as that of CsBO2 as shown in Figure 7, CsI could be easily dissolved in water and change to Cs+ and I−, while CsBO2 is not soluble to the same extent.
Therefore, the gaseous 137Cs measured before 29 March is considered to be CsOH or CsI which was dissolved in hygroscopic moisture. On the contrary, the particulate 137Cs measured after 30 March is considered to be CsBO2 particulate or the particulate which CsBO2 became the nucleus, and the nucleus growth occurred by deposition of other radionuclide onto the nucleus surface. Unfortunately, the elemental composition data of the measured 137Cs particulates are not available but the measured increase in 137Cs particulate concentration after 30 March supports the release of CsBO2.
The decrease in the 131I/137Cs ratio (increase in 137Cs release) on 30 March can be explained not by CsI release but by CsBO2 release. The trend of 137Cs release after 2 April reverted to the overall trend that follows the decay of radioactive 131I because the dominant chemical form was changed from CsBO2 generated in the RPV to CsI generated in the CV or the reactor buildings owing to, for example, re-suspension.
4.4. Possible reason for termination of gaseous 137Cs release on 29 March
When the core temperature increases again after cool down, as in the Fukushima accident, CsBO2 formed under high temperatures and solidified at the bottom of the RPV after melt down could be re-vaporized (see chapter 4.2).
The release of 137Cs from fuel would occur continuously from the lower temperatures to temperature higher than about 1500 K, at which B4C oxidation occurs [29]. Therefore, all 137Cs released from the fuel cannot react with B2O3 and some of 137Cs would exist as CsOH. However, if the core temperature increases again after pausing for a while after cooling, it is possible that HBO2, H3BO3 or B2O3 could react with almost of all remaining CsOH or CsI based on formulas (14) and (15), and CsBO2 would be newly formed. Otherwise CsOH would be deposited onto the surface of particulate CsBO2 formed by re-vaporization.
The measurement of gaseous 137Cs was continued until 29 March possibly because the release of CsOH from 1F2 continued up to 29 March because there was no re-ascension of the 1F2 core temperature between 16 March and 29 March. By contrast, re-ascension of the 1F1 and 1F3 core temperatures began on around 20 March and CsOH release from them decreased thereafter. However, re-ascension of the 1F2 core temperature started at last on 29 March, and CsOH release from 1F2 also decreased, as in the cases of 1F1 and 1F3. Therefore, gaseous 137Cs release was not observed after 30 March. In this way, the series of observation results can be explained.
5. Discussions
5.1. Amount of CH3I released from 1F3 during Fukushima accident
It is important to know the source term of organic iodine such as CH3I, during severe accidents because most of CH3I does not dissolve in water and cannot be removed easily by using an aerosol filter. The Phébus FPT3 experiment with B4C control rods showed an enhancement of CH3I [7] (about 8% [25] of iodine inventory), which was never observed in the experiments with SIC control rods used in typical PWRs. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to estimate CH3I release during the Fukushima accident.
The increase in the 131I/137Cs ratio from 15 March to 16 March corresponds mostly to the timing of suppression pool venting at 1F3, as shown in Figure 2. The Japanese government report [10] describes that the venting was initiated at 16:05 on 15 March.
Most of iodine compounds such as CsI or I2, with the exception of organic iodine (CH3I), can be removed by pool scrubbing during their passage through the suppression pool. Although I2 has a gaseous form and the solubility of I2 in water is very weak (see Table 3), about 99% of I2 is soluble in water in the chemical form of I−. It has also been reported that the decontamination factor of the pool scrubbing could decrease in the case of the saturated water [30], which may have also occurred in the Fukushima accident. However, in that case, it is guessed that both of 131I removal and 137Cs removal are affected and the 131I/137Cs ratio does not change considerably.
Therefore, the excess 131I release from 15 March to 16 March can be attributed to the release of CH3I formed by the reaction of iodine with CO, CO2, or CH4 that are generated by oxidation of the absorber material B4C as described in chapter 4.2 or the reaction of iodine and the paint on the CV wall [31].
Owing to the reasons described above, the amount of CH3I released from 1F3 during venting can be estimated based on the 131I/137Cs ratio, and 131I release rate and release duration, and it becomes equal to 1.31 × 1016 Bq (1.85 × 1016 Bq on 11 March). Details of the calculations are described in Table 5. The new source terms originally predicted the gross CH3I release rate from 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3 assuming 60% of all gaseous iodine is CH3I and the rest is I2 based on the method of RASCAL 4.0 [32]. The prediction results are also given in Table 5. The present estimation based on the phenomena in the RPV is considered more reliable than the prediction by Katata.
Table 5. Estimation of CH3I release during the 1F3 suppression pool venting.
From Table 5, the ratio of CH3I release during the venting to the 131I inventory in 1F3 is equal to about 0.8% and is larger than the descriptions of NUREG/CR-5732 [23] in which 0.15% of the total iodine released to the CV is in the form of CH3I. On the contrary, the hypothetical accident in the Japanese review guides for site evaluation [33] and safety assessment [34] prepared by the previous Nuclear Safety Commission assumes that 5% of the total iodine core inventory is organic iodine (CH3I). This study supports the assertion that the review guides were prepared based on a conservative assumption compared with the Fukushima accident.
5.2. Delay of increase in source terms by WSPEEDI reverse compared with simulation codes before 16 March
Comparing the increase in cumulative 131I and 137Cs release from 12 March to 16 March obtained by WSPEEDI reverse and those obtained by simulation codes such as MELCOR (see Figure 1), WSPEEDI reverse clearly predicted a slower increase in release than MELCOR. The simulation codes usually treat the condensation of gaseous radionuclides or the deposition of particulates onto the inside wall of BWR reactor building, RCS, and CV, while WSPEEDI reverse considers the time for transportation of radionuclides along with the flow of air current to the monitoring points.
A possible reason for the difference is that during the transportation of radionuclides from the outside of the reactor building to the monitoring points, condensation or deposition of radionuclides onto the outside structures of the reactor building or the land near the NPPs and re-vaporization or re-suspension from there could have occurred repeatedly, and this could have caused a delay in the increase in source terms that are not considered by both methods. This issue needs to be investigated further.
5.3. Prediction accuracy of new source terms when the wind blows from land to sea
The release rates of 131I and 137Cs obtained using the new source terms decreased gradually after 16 March but they increased temporarily on 18 March (see Figure 3). This trend was not predicted by Terada. Since the reactor cores of 1F1, 1F2 and 1F3 were cooled sufficiently on 18 March (see Figures 5–7), it is difficult to think that the core temperature increased on that day.
On 18 March, the wind blew from land to sea and the source terms were predicted from the measured sea surface concentration using an estimation grid of 80 km over the ocean [2], which is larger by about one order of magnitude than the estimation grid over land. It cannot be denied that some uncertainties were included in the estimation. It is expected that this examination be performed continuously in future.
Similarly, the new source terms did not predict the decrease in the 131I release rate on 26 March. This decrease was predicted by Terada and may have been caused by the decrease in the 131I release rate from the contaminated water by covering of the surface by pure water, when the 1F2 core cooling water was changed from seawater to pure water on that day [5]. Since the wind also blew from land to sea on 26 March as well, further investigation may be needed.
6. Conclusions
This study investigated 131I and 137Cs release behaviors during the late phase of the Fukushima accident based on the 131I/137Cs ratio of the source terms put forth by Katata, which were recently evaluated backward by using the WSPEEDI code based on environmental monitoring data.
Even after 17 March, the core temperatures of 1F1 and 1F3 increased temporarily by several hundred Kelvin from 21 March to 23 March, and that of 1F2 increased on 31 March when TEPCO operators were optimizing the core cooling flow rate. The evaluation by WSPEEDI reverse showed that the excess release of 131I over 137Cs occurred on 21 March and from 23 March to 29 March, and that of 137Cs over 131I occurred on 22 March and from 30 March to 31 March.
The excess of 131I release can be explained by the 131I gas–liquid partition on the surface of the contaminated water accumulated in the basements of the 1F2 and the 1F3 reactor buildings. 131I release from the contaminated water was reevaluated based on the new source terms. In addition, organic iodine (CH3I) release during venting of the 1F3 suppression pool was estimated based preliminarily on the 131I/137Cs ratio obtained using the new source terms. The fractions of 131I and 137Cs released due to the specific mechanisms to their total cumulative releases predicted by this study are summarized in Table 6.
Table 6. Fractions of 131I and 137Cs released due to specific mechanisms to their total cumulative releases.
The excess of 137Cs release can be explained by re-vaporization of CsBO2 from solidified materials relocated to the lower part of the RPV after reactions of Cs with B4C or additional formation by reaction of CsOH with boric acid when the core temperature re-ascended owing to slight shortage of cooling water. Environmental radiation monitoring performed in Tokai showed that gaseous 137Cs was measured up to 29 March but not after 30 March. These findings could also be explained by the change from CsOH in hygroscopic moisture to particulate CsBO2 on that day.
There remain substantial differences in the source terms during the Fukushima accident between simulation codes such as MELCOR and WSPEEDI reverse. The main reasons for these differences are that the present simulation codes do not treat the releases of 131I and 137Cs, especially the CsBO2 generated due to the re-ascension of core temperature owing to slight shortage of core cooling water. In addition, the codes do not model the 131I gas–liquid partition on the surface of the contaminated water accumulated in the basements of reactor buildings during the late phases of the Fukushima accident.
