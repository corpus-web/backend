Highlights
Electro-reduction processes of porous U3O8 sintered pellets were systematically studied and two intermediate products were carefully identified.
Metal-oxide-electrolyte three-phase interline (3PI) and lithium metal thermal reduction were applied to explain the electro-reduction processes of porous U3O8.
Abstract
U3O8, the most stable state of uranium oxides, is a key intermediate compound for pyroprocessing of used nuclear fuel. However, compared to UO2, the electro-deoxidation mechanism of U3O8 is still cursory due to the complicated U-O intermediate phases. In this paper, the electro-deoxidation processes of U3O8 were investigated via diverse methods. A molybdenum metallic cavity electrode loaded with U3O8 powder was adopted to investigate the electrochemical behavior via cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. Sintered U3O8 pellets were used as cathodes to obtain electrolytic products with varying applied voltages or duration time. The composition and microstructure of electrolytic products were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer. Based on above analysis results, electro-reduction processes of porous U3O8 pellets were proposed. First, U3O8 undergoes a rapid transition to U4O9 (U4O9-y). Then, the intermediate compound was gradually reduced to UO2 from the outer layer to the center of the bulk due to the limited migration rate of O2−. Before the transformation completed, metallic U generated on the surface of the bulk through direct electro-deoxidation and Li metal thermal reduction. With the increase of porosity and the propagation of metal-oxide-electrolyte three-phase interline, the U3O8 pellet was finally reduced to metallic U bulk.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, nuclear energy plays an important role as a green energy in China to alleviate the carbon emission [1]. However, one of the challenges faced by the nuclear industry is the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel (UNF). Once-through fuel cycle strategy to store the UNF for thousands years with or without simple treatments cannot meet the requirement of sustainable development [2]. In recent years, pyroprocessing of UNF in molten salt is proposed to adequately utilize the limited uranium resource [3], which is non-proliferation compared to hydrometallurgical process [4].
Pyroprocessing technology employs electro-deoxidation method to reprocess oxide fuels, such as light water reactor (LWR) and mixed oxide (MOX) fuels. Electro-deoxidation, a novel technology proposed by Chen [5] et al. called as Fray Farthing Chen Cambridge process (FFC), has been adopted to prepare varied metals [6], [7], [8] and alloys [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] from oxides. The electro-deoxidation of uranium oxides to metal has been studied in forms of UO2 [15], U3O8 [16], dense UO2 [17,18], MOX [19], UO2-MoO3 [20] and irradiated used oxide fuels [21]. UO2, with a lower chemical valence, has a straightforward reaction route of electro-deoxidation process. For the sintered UO2 pellets, microstructure acts an important role in the UO2 reduction rate according to the structure-controlled experiment [22] and the focused ion beam (FIB) tomography experiment [23]. However, UO2 pellets should be sintered above 1673 K in the reducing atmosphere to get the appropriate microstructure [24], which is hard for safe scale production.
As the most stable form of uranium oxides, U3O8 is more convenient to be obtained in reprocessing of UNF. Moreover, abundant framework structures of U3O8 could be obtained through an oxidation process by crushing the structure of UO2 [25,26]. Whereas, the electro-deoxidation processes of U3O8 would be different from that of UO2 for the evolvement of intermediate compounds. The thermodynamics of electro-deoxidation of UO2 was proved to be a one-step reaction [27], while the transition of U3O8 to metallic U bulk in LiCl molten salt went through more intricate stages [28,29], and the conclusions are controversial. Jeong and co-workers [30] believed that a perovskite structure assigned to LiUO3 firstly formed, then U4O9 and UO2 generated from LiUO3 or U3O8 later. Park [31] et al. and Jiang [32] et al. held that U3O8 mainly went through a two-step reduction process, in which UO2 acted as the intermediate, and unstable intermediates, like UO2-x, LiUxOy or UO2+x, existed for a short time.
Moreover, the kinetics of electro-deoxidation of U3O8 is also mysterious. In the study of electro-deoxidation mechanism, the solid (conductive product)/solid (oxides)/liquid (molten salt) three-phase interline (3PI) theory was put forward in 2004 [33], proved to be feasible to understand the propagation of electro-deoxidation and optimize corresponding technics [34]. According to 3PI theory, electro-deoxidation reaction often occurs on the boundary of metal phase (electrode or the reduced metal), oxide phase and salt phase. Some experts [35,36] have observed the evolution of 3PI in the partly-reduced bulk, which is adequate to verify 3PI theory. However, direct application of 3PI theory to understand the electro-deoxidation mechanism of U3O8 seems to be a failure due to the poor conductivity of intermediate compound UO2. In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to study the electro-deoxidation mechanism of U3O8. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) electrochemical tests were conducted in an elaborate way and potentiostatic electrolysis with sintered U3O8 pellets were employed to obtain the intermediate compounds, which were further verified by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses. This report is in favor of understanding the electro-reduction processes of porous U3O8 pellets, which is essential to optimize the technical parameters for higher reduction degree and efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
UO2 powder (99% nuclear purity, China North Nuclear Fuel Co., Ltd.) and anhydrous LiCl (99.99% purity, Alfa Aesar) were used as raw materials in this work. The LiCl salt was dried in a vacuum drying chamber at 473 K for 24 h and 623 K for 48 h step by step to remove the majority of moisture. UO2 and U3O8 powder were dried through the same way. An Al2O3 dense crucible (99% purity) was used to contain the electrolyte at 923 K.
Due to the hygroscopicity of LiCl and the high solubility of Li2O and LiOH in LiCl molten salt, it is impossible to obtain a high-purity LiCl molten salt containing limited O2− and OH− via traditional drying method. Thus, in this paper, a pre-electrolysis procedure was adopted to get high-purity LiCl molten salt soon after the salt taken out from the vacuum drying chamber. According to the theoretical decomposition potentials (calculated by HSC chemistry software version 6.0) of LiCl (-3.46 V) and Li2O (-2.47 V), Li2O can be easily removed from the molten salt with the applied voltage slightly lower than the decomposition potential of LiCl. Moreover, LiOH was gradually removed from the molten salt with the volatilization of H2O and the right shift of the equilibrium reaction as showed:
@(1)
A constant potential of -2.00 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was applied to a three-electrode system for 2 h. The current gradually declined to 3 mA or lower, indicating the elimination of Li2O and LiOH from LiCl molten salt. The pre-electrolysis method eventually obtained a high-purity LiCl molten salt with limited Li2O and LiOH.
The UO2 powder was oxidized and pulverized to U3O8 at 823 K under air atmosphere for 12 h. After a complete oxidation, the color of the powder changed from brown to dark green. The microstructure of U3O8 powder is anomalously reticular and the particle size is about 0.1~1 µm. U4O9 sample was obtained by heat treatment at 1323 K of a mixture of UO2 and U3O8 with O/U ratio being about 2.23, and detailed description of preparation procedures can be found elsewhere [37]. The dried UO2, U4O9 and U3O8 powder were also used as the referenced sample in the Raman spectrometer test.
Then, about 2.80 g U3O8 powder was then pressed into a cylinder green pellet (about 1.00 cm in diameter and 1.10 cm in height) with 100 MPa pressure using tablet press. The microstructural image and appearance of this green pellet are shown in Fig. 1a. After that, the green pellet was sintered at 1273 K under Ar atmosphere to fabricate the porous U3O8 sintered pellet with a steady meshy structure, as shown in Fig. 1b. After sintering process, the layered structure of raw U3O8 pellet become compact and porous with the enlarged grain size and decreasing porosity. Moreover, the average density of the pellets get higher from 4.12 g cm−3 (49.08 % of theoretical density) to 6.63 g cm−3 (78.98 % of theoretical density) accompanied by darker color. The porous U3O8 sintered pellets were used in the electro-reduction experiments without further management.

2.2. Methods
The electrolysis cell was installed in a glove box (DELLIX Industry Co., Ltd.) filled with high purity argon gas (O2 and H2O are less than 1 ppm). A molybdenum metallic cavity electrode (MCE) with two holes (0.05 cm in diameter) [38] was used as a working electrode for CV and SWV measurements to observe the cathodic behavior. The electrolyte-submerged surface area of MCE was measured to be 0.262 cm2 with the settled immerged depth in the following tests.
A high-purity carbon rod (99.99% purity, 4 mm in diameter) was used as a counter electrode in all electrochemical experiments. The reference electrode was fabricated from a Ag wire (99.99% purity, 1 mm in diameter) inserted into a 8 mm diameter alumina tube filled with LiCl salt containing AgCl (1.0 wt%). All potentials reported in this manuscript are given versus this Ag/AgCl reference electrode unless otherwise specified. In the potentiostatic electrolysis experiments, U3O8 pellets tied with nickel wires (99.99% purity, 1 mm in diameter) were used as working electrodes, and carbon rods (99.99% purity, 6 mm in diameter) were used as counter electrodes. The crucibles and metallic electrodes were cleaned with 1 mol L−1 nitric acid, deionized water and methanol in sequence, subsequently completely dried, and mounted for experimentation.
During electrochemical measurements and potentiostatic electrolysis experiments, the cell potentials and currents were monitored by PARSTAT 2273 (Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstation with the PowerSuite software package. The components of electrolysis products were analyzed by LabRam Xplora confocal Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using 532 nm laser with 12.5 mW laser power and XRD (Dandong TD-3500 diffractometer) using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV. The microstructure of the bulks and the distribution of elements were characterized by SEM (Helios Nanolab 600i) and the packed EDS function, respectively, after polished and washed with distilled water. The oxygen content of reduced uranium sample was analyzed by oxygen compositional analyzer (OCA, LECO Corporation) to determine the reduction extent.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electrochemical behavior
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at 923 K in the high-purity LiCl molten salt using a MCE loaded or unloaded with U3O8 powder. The cyclic voltammetry scanning was conducted by starting from the rest potential at around -0.50 V to a vertex potential -2.40 V and then reversing the scanning direction back to the starting potentials. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. When a bare MCE was employed, the CV curve (dash line in Fig. 2) shows only one typical reductive peak D at -2.25 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Obviously, the anodic peak corresponds to the stripping of deposited metal [39]. The linear increase of the cathodic current with the applied potential and suddenly falling to background are attributed to the deposition of Li+ ions on the MCE and the dissolution of the deposited Li metal, respectively. Similar typical reductive peak D is also found at about -2.25 V in Fig. 2 using a MCE loaded with U3O8 powder (solid line), which is also corresponding to the reduction of Li+ ions on the MCE to Li metal. A series of new redox peaks arise in Fig. 2 with U3O8 powder. The cathodic peak A at -0.67 V, peak B at -1.47 V and peak C at -2.18 V are typical of electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode under diffusion condition. Considering the close theoretical decomposition potentials of UO2 (-2.40 V) and Li2O (-2.47 V), we suppose that peak C corresponds to the reduction of UO2 to the metallic U. Additionally, polarization overvoltage on the cathode leads to the overlapping of peaks C and D in CV test. The CV curve with similar features was also reported by other studies [32]. The same reason determines the deviations of peaks A and B from their practical positions. In a whole electro-deoxidation process of U3O8, peak B may correspond to the formation of UO2, while the cathodic peak A is assigned to the intermediate compounds with O/U ratio between 2.00 and 2.67.

As a more sensitive method, square wave voltammetry was used to further investigate the electrochemical reduction processes of U3O8 powder. In the test, the applied pulse height was 25 mV, the potential step was 1 mV and the scanning frequency was 10Hz. The inset in Fig. 2 showed a square wave voltammogram for the electrochemical processes of MCE loaded with U3O8 powder. Three reduction signals A, B and C were observed at -0.66 V, -1.42 V and -2.12 V respectively, which are in good agreement with those of CV. Comprehensive consideration of the results of CV and SWV, we could draw an assumption that there exist two intermediate compounds in the electro-deoxidation processes of U3O8 in LiCl molten salt and the former compound could be described as UO2+x or U4O9-y, which will be verified in the next experiments, while the latter is UO2.
3.2. Intermediate compounds
Before integrated electro-deoxidation tests, potentiostatic electrolysis at -0.80 V and -1.80 V (a little negative than peak A and B, respectively) were applied on the sintered U3O8 pellets for 30 min to detect the intermediate compounds proposed in CV and SWV tests. The current-time curves were recorded in Figs. 3a and 3b for the electro-deoxidation experiments. As shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, an obvious hump with rapid ascent and decline is observed in each curve. Insets in Figs. 3c and 3d show the appearances of pellets after electrolysis with slightly polishing process. A clearly conversion of color from dark green to gray is discovered in inset c when -0.80 V was applied on U3O8 bulk, indicating a new compound generated. Moreover, dark brown compound generated in inset d when electrolysis voltage was -1.80 V. The corresponding SEM images are also showed in Figs. 3c and 3d. Although SEM images were affected by the adhering LiCl salt, obvious differences of gain sizes and shapes are discovered compared to Fig. 1b. SEM images and appearances of the bulks demonstrated the evolution of electro-deoxidation of U3O8. And more analyses are also needed to verify the compositions of the bulks with different applied voltages. What should be stated is that, some transient compounds could not be detected under our condition as uranium oxides are very complicated.

The humps in two I-t curves can be explained by the competition of reaction area increase with the diminution of reactant and conductivity. Nuclear purity U3O8 is a cation excess n-type semiconductor [40] and was found to get an average conductivity of 138.4 (Ω cm)−1 at 723-1123 K [41], while the conductivities of UO2+x (x<0.23) or U4O9-y were less than 30 (Ω cm)−1 at about 973 K according to the experimental and calculated results by an experiential equation [42]. Additionally, the conductivities of UO2+x, U4O9-y and U3O8-z descend with the oxygen content decrease [43]. Sintered U3O8 bulk is suffused with oxygen vacancy, which also provides good conductivity. Once started electro-reduction process, based on the high onset current, sintered U3O8 bulk was rapidly reduced to intermediate oxides, such as U4O9-y and UO2+x. During this process, the theoretical density of uranium oxides increased more than 35%, which resulted in the enlargement of porosity. Then, molten salt would extend in the bulk with augment of reaction area, which leaded to the steep rise of current intensity at first. Afterwards, the current descended down at a corresponding rate because large current could rapidly deplete the U3O8 reactant. Therefore, the humps in two I-t curves engendered.
Samples electrolyzed at -0.80 V and -1.80 V for 30 min were also analyzed with XRD as shown in Fig. 4. The diffraction curves of the two samples seem corresponding to characteristic peaks of U4O9 (PDF-#72-0125) and UO2 (PDF-#41-1422), respectively, indicating the two intermediate compounds generated in the electro-deoxidation process. However, the characteristic peaks of U4O9 and UO2 are very close to each other. It is unprecise to estimate the component only by XRD patterns.
Fig. 4. XRD patterns of bulks electrolyzed at -0.80 V and -1.80 V, respectively.
In view of XRD technique is hard to precisely distinguish the x value in UO2+x, the Raman spectroscopy technique, which shows particular fingerprint corresponding to some vibration modes [44], was applied to detect the intermediate compounds. U3O8 pellets electrolyzed at -0.80 V, -1.80 V and -2.40 V for 30 min and -2.40 V for 360 min were used in these tests, while pure UO2, U4O9 and U3O8 samples were used as references. Even the adhering LiCl salt affected the Raman spectroscopic intensities, sample prepared at -0.80 V showed an apparent Raman scattering peak at 640 cm−1 in Fig. 5. According to the Raman spectrum study of U4O9 [45], the peak position around 630 cm−1 is the most significant feature to distinguish U4O9 from other uranium oxides. At the same time, the practical peak position varies with the x value of UO2+x (x<0.25), the peak of UO2.03 is located at 623 cm−1, while shifting to 637 cm−1 for UO2.24 [46]. Therefore, the Raman peak located at 640 cm−1 represents the formation of U4O9 (U4O9-y). A totally different scattering curve is present for the sample prepared at -1.80 V, which is similar to the shape of UO2, further suggesting the production of UO2 of redox peaks B/B’ in Fig. 2. From the results of Raman spectroscopy, we can make a conclusion that the intermediate compound generated at redox peaks A/A’ is U4O9 (U4O9-y), and peaks B/B’ represent UO2 in Fig. 2.
Fig. 5. Raman spectra of U3O8, U4O9, UO2 and samples prepared at -0.80 V, -1.80 V.
When -2.40 V was applied on U3O8 pellet for 30 min, the sample showed similar scattering curve as -1.80 V for 30 min in Raman test, while no obvious peak was found in the sample electrolyzed for 360 min. According to the Raman spectrum of uranium [47], metallic uranium only presents weak Raman peaks below 200 cm−1. Therefore, after the production of metallic uranium on the pellet with a period of time, Raman peaks disappeared as Fig. 5 shows.
3.3. The effect of electrolysis potentials
According to CV and SWV results in Section 3.1, the electrochemical reduction potential of UO2/U is close to Li metal deposition potential, which means that electro-deoxidation of U3O8 pellet inevitably mixes with the Li metal deposition. To optimize the electrolysis parameters, we investigated the effect of electrolysis potential before an integrated electro-reduction experiment.
A series of controlled variable potentiostatic electrolysis experiments were conducted using U3O8 bulks at different potentials with same duration time. Fig. 6 shows current-time curves at different potentials on blank Ni wire electrodes without sintered pellets. The surface area of Ni wire electrodes is about 5.53 cm2 (see inset in Fig. 6). And all the Ni wire electrodes used in Figs. 6 and 7 have similar surface areas. According to I-t curve at -2.20 V, the current is about 22 mA, which is assigned to background current. With the negative shift of potential from -2.30 V to -2.50 V, the current increased from 48 mA to 335 mA due to the deposition of Li metal. At -2.30 V, the current increment is 26mA, which is much smaller than 153 mA at -2.40 and 313 mA at -2.50 V. It means that at -2.30 V, the Li metal just starts to deposit.
Fig. 6. Current-time curves of electro-deoxidation using blank Ni electrodes at -2.20 V, -2.30 V, -2.40 V and -2.50 V for 30 min.
Fig. 7. Current-time curves of electro-deoxidation using Ni wire electrodes loaded U3O8 sintered bulks at -2.20 V, -2.30 V, -2.40 V and -2.50 V for 30 min.
Fig. 7 shows current-time curves at different potentials on Ni wire electrodes with sintered pellets (see inset in Fig. 7). Compared to Fig. 6, the currents in Fig. 7 have large increments, which are caused by the electro-deoxidation of U3O8 sintered pellets. In Fig. 7, platforms are observed after humps in all I-t curves. The formation of hump-shape curve gives rise to the same reason in Figs. 3a and 3b for the electro-deoxidation of U3O8 to UO2, and the platform attributes to the propagation of 3PI from outer layer to the center of the bulk. Interestingly, the conversion of U3O8 to UO2 in the hump stage always occurred rapidly and completed in 10 min, therefore, the deposited Li was hard to take part in the reduction processes at this time.
Moreover, after deduction of current for depositing Li metal, the currents of the platform (ΔI) maintain almost same value (Fig. 8), which means that the current for the electro-deoxidation of UO2 from outer layer to the center is almost constant. In other words, after -2.40 V, continuous increase of overpotential has been used to deposit Li metal, rather than the electro-deoxidation process. After potentiostatic electrolysis at -2.50 V for 360 min, liquid Li metal was observed on the surface of molten LiCl melts, which means that excess Li metal has not been involved into the thermal reduction process. Therefore, -2.50 V and more negative potential are not suitable for the reduction of U3O8 sintered pellets. After potentiostatic electrolysis at -2.30 V for 360 min, the products showed outer metal and inner oxides, which is similar to the product in Fig. 9d. The obtained bulk was only partly reduced, and many black products were found adhering on the bulk and the LiCl molten salt, which are attributed to serious side reactions caused by carbon electrode [48]. Fig. 8 also shows the current proportion of electro-deoxidation (η). At -2.40 V, the electro-deoxidation current proportion is about 50%. After potentiostatic electrolysis at -2.40 V for 360 min, we could obtain almost complete reduced pellets. No extra liquid Li metal was observed on the melts during this course, which indicates that the deposited Li metal adequately participated in the thermal reduction of U3O8 pellets and accelerated the electro-deoxidation process. In addition, Merwin and co-workers [49] have reported the parameters of operating carbon anodes in the electrolytic reduction of uranium dioxide in LiCl melts. It was proposed that the ability of carbon anodes to successfully reduce UO2 was governed by the cathode current density, which was higher than 0.1 A g−1. In our work, the current at -2.40 V was about 0.14 A g−1, which is in agreement with their conclusions. Therefore, -2.40 V is a suitable potential for the electro-reduction of U3O8 sintered pellet.

3.4. Complete electro-reduction processes of U3O8 bulk
Controlled variable potentiostatic electrolysis experiments were then conducted using U3O8 bulks at -2.40 V for different duration time for the investigation of kinetics. The typical current-time curve and the corresponding consumed charge for 360 min is presented in Fig. 9a and the macroscopic appearances of samples obtained by potentiostatic electrolysis for 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min and 360 min are displayed in Fig. 9 (b-f). An approximate platform is observed after a hump shape in Fig. 9a. The formation of hump-shape curve gives rise to the same reason in Figs. 3a and 3b, and the platform attributes to the propagation of 3PI from outer layer to the center of the bulk. Judging by the consumed charges, majority of U3O8 was reduced to U4O9 (U4O9-y) and UO2, for the high overpotential imposed to the bulk and the semiconducting property of U3O8. However, as the electro-deoxidation of UO2 to U is a diffusion-dominated chemical process occurring in molten salt, the corresponding current intensity was not significantly accelerated when metallic U gradually generated on the cathode. In fact, the current intensity in Fig. 9a came through a slightly deceasing because the diffusion of O2− became difficult. Finally, a sharply drop down of current took place at about 350 min, which may signify the completely conversion from U3O8 to metallic U. The shining cross section of bulk in Fig. 9f also testified that change. Besides, several small pieces were clipped off from the completed reduced metallic U bulk using wire cutters. After rapidly washed by distilled water and ethanol, these small pieces were immediately used to analyze the oxygen content by OCA [50]. The average oxygen content was 720 ppm. In other words, the reduction extent (R) of U3O8 is about 99.60% using Eq. (2).
@(2)
Where, R is the reduction extent, x is the oxygen content in the sample. The current efficiency is calculated to be 70.61% by calculate the percentage of consumed charges to the theoretically charges for 2.80 g U3O8. The values of current efficiency for conversion of U3O8 to U reported by Park [31] and Hur [51] are more than 75% and 63.9%, respectively. The difference may be attributed to varying porosity of oxides, applied voltages or current densities, impurities in molten salts and anode materials.
The macroscopic appearances of samples in Fig. 9(b-f) were obtained after polished in depth to get fresh cross sections. The transition processes from raw U3O8 to intermediate products and the evolution from surface to interior are confirmed by color shift of these pictures. The cross section in Fig. 9b shows a uniformity color of gray, similar to inset c in Fig. 3, which further confirms that the formation of U4O9 (U4O9-y) is prior to UO2. Noticeably, the cross section in Fig. 9c shows three parts: a metal shell around the bulk (although very thin), a dark brown middle layer between the shell and a gray core at the center. It means that metallic U has been generated before the transition from U3O8 to UO2 completed, which is attributed to the limited transmission rate of O2− in the center and low conductivity of U4O9 (U4O9-y). Figs. 9d and 9e demonstrate the evolution of metallic U from the edge towards to the center of the bulk with the complete transformation of U3O8 to UO2. Finally, a metallic U bulk was obtained after six hours electrolysis in Fig. 9f.
Fig. 10 shows the XRD results of bulks before and after electrolysis for 10 min, 30 min, 60 min and 360 min. Diffraction pattern of sample after electrolysis for 10 min shows the characteristic peaks of UO2 and U4O9, and peaks of raw U3O8 (PDF-#31-1424) have completely disappeared. This could compare with the I-t curve in Fig. 9a, which testifies the conversion from U3O8 to U4O9 is a rapid course in 10 min. After electrolysis for 30 min, the diffraction result exhibits an individual pattern of UO2, indicating complete reduction of U4O9 on the surface layer. Then, characteristic peaks of U (PDF-#24-0748) start to show weak intensities in the sample for 60 min, and become the only diffraction pattern after electrolysis for 360 min, which indicates that U3O8 has been nearly completely reduced to metallic uranium.

The sample displayed in Fig. 9e was analyzed by SEM and EDS to investigate the morphology features and element distribution of the 3PI evolution. According to the 3PI theory, metal and metal oxide phases are located beside an interline with different morphologies. As shown in Fig. 11a, a clear boundary lied between two areas with distinct morphologies and porosities. The actual porosity of metallic uranium part is much larger than that displayed due to the increase of density. However, the flexible metallic U refills the holes after polishing process. The increase of porosity is beneficial to the diffusion of O2−. Figs. 11 (b-d) demonstrate the removal of O element and the augment of Cl element after electro-deoxidation through the boundary. The displayed boundary is confirmed to be 3PI reported by Chen [5] et al. according to the distributions of Cl, O and U elements, the distinct morphologies and porosities.

3.5. Comprehending of electro-reduction processes
Based on above results, possible electro-reduction processes of U3O8 in LiCl molten salt have been proposed. The possible morphological sketches of the bulk in different electro-deoxidation stages are exhibited in Fig. 12. In Fig. 12a, a sintered U3O8 bulk was immersed into LiCl molten salt with the cavity filled up with electrolyte immediately. In Fig. 12b, after electrolysis for about 10 min at -2.4 V, the majority of U3O8 was reduced to U4O9 (U4O9-y), for the high overpotential imposed to the bulk and the semiconducting property of U3O8. Then in Fig. 12c, the intermediate compound was gradually reduced to UO2 from the outer layer to the center of the bulk due to the poor conductivity of U4O9 (U4O9-y) and limited transmission rate of O2−. Before the transition completed, metallic U generated on the surface of the bulk at about 30 min as displayed in Fig. 12d. With the increase of porosity and the propagation of 3PI showed in Fig. 12e, the U3O8 bulk was finally reduced to metallic U bulk after 360 min electrolysis by mixed electro-deoxidation and thermal reduction mechanisms in Fig. 12f.
Fig. 12. The morphological sketches of U3O8 bulk during electro-deoxidation processes.
During the whole process, metallic Li generated at -2.40 V was in situ consumed by uranium oxides. First, the conversion from U3O8 to U4O9 and UO2 induced by direct electrochemical reduction in the first 30 min is violent enough to ignore the effect of lithium thermal reduction. In the later conversion, direct electrochemical reduction rate was decelerated by the transmission rate of O2− until it is comparative with that of lithium thermal reduction rate. With the promotion of these two effects, U3O8 bulk was reduced in a steady rate from outer layer to the center.
The above discussion is based on insufficient Li metal produced by in-situ electro-deposition. If an electrode potential of -2.50 V or higher was introduced to the electro-reduction, excess Li metal could not be immediately consumed and would form Li liquid drop floating on the molten salt, which destroyed the electrolysis system, such as electrode, crucible and equipment. Therefore, a higher potential than -2.40 V may not be the optimal choice for the electro-reduction of U3O8 bulk.
4. Conclusions
The electro-reduction processes of U3O8 were analyzed via diverse methods. We draw a conclusion that two intermediate compounds were produced during the electro-deoxidation processes of U3O8 bulk in LiCl molten salt: one is assigned to U4O9 (U4O9-y) and the other is UO2. First, a rapid transition from U3O8 to U4O9 (U4O9-y) occurred due to the semiconducting property of U3O8. It followed the production of UO2 from the outer layer to the center of the bulk due to the limited transmission rate of O2− and poor conductivity of U4O9-y. These two processes belong to direct electrochemical reduction mechanism and lithium thermal reduction showed negligible influence. The next electro-deoxidation process from UO2 to metallic U is 3PI propagation mechanism because UO2 is almost non-conducting. During this course, metallic Li was generated and in situ consumed, accelerating the electro-deoxidation process. The complete electro-reduction of 2.80 g U3O8 bulk to metallic uranium was finally achieved at about 350 min in LiCl molten salt through electrolysis at a constant voltage of -2.40 V. The results are helpful to comprehending of electro-reduction processes of U3O8 bulk and can be also derived to other valence variable metal oxides.
