Abstract
In this study, silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) based 3-layered composite material containing hexagonal boron nitride, boron oxide and bismuth (III) oxide, respectively for each layer, was developed. Materials with boron content are effective in thermal neutron absorption so the composite of silicone rubber and hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) would be a good neutron shielding material. In addition, silicone rubber used in this study, is a high temperature vulcanization (HTV) type silicone rubber which is noted flexibility, high transparency and superior mechanical properties. Composite materials of 9 sets with different contents were prepared. Mechanical, thermal and neutron attenuation tests were performed. It was experimentally determined that a composite having lead equivalent thickness of 0.35 mmPb were developed. In addition, thermal neutron attenuation tests performed for each of 9 sets, and attenuation rates (I/I0) of between 69% and 71% was obtained and I/I0 value was drastically decreased to 30.8% with increase of hBN content from 10% to 30%.
1. Introduction
Ionizing radiation is inevitably, a part of our daily life. Use of ionizing radiation is enhanced with developments in technology. Variety of fields such as research, industry and medicine are the areas, among others, that employ ionizing radiation as a tool for their activities. Electromagnetic radiation is classified as either ionizing or non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation takes forms such as alpha/beta/neutron particles and gamma/X rays. These types of radiations could be harmful both human beings, biotic/abiotic environment especially for the cases of gamma, X-ray and neutron radiations when the required safety precaution are not set accordingly. Gamma and neutron radiations are sometimes used together in the radiation sources for different purposes. Hazards of these types of radiations could be avoided with shielding materials by attenuating or absorbing radiation energy or particles. Polymer composites, glass materials, semiconductors, concrete and building materials have been used for radiation shielding purposes (Malkapur et al., 2017).
Different concrete and building materials are used for shielding purposes due to its cost-effectiveness. For instance, radiation shielding of concrete containing zeolite and barite was studied (Akkurt et al., 2010a, Akkurt et al., 2010b, Akkurt and El-Khayatt, 2013, Basyigit et al., 2005). In addition, Studies on concrete with lead-fly ash content (Singh et al., 2015) and concrete containing bismuth oxide (Yao et al., 2016) were reported for the purpose of gamma ray shielding. Moreover, radiation shielding properties of concrete reinforced with basalt fiber infused with boron oxide were investigated (Zorla et al., 2017). On the other hand, glass material is used as an alternate radiation shielding material. Heavy metal oxide containing glass materials were reported for gamma ray shielding (Kaur et al., 2016). Also, several glass materials have been developed thanks to allowing visibility while shielding electromagnetic radiation (Singh et al., 2004, Singh et al., 2006, Singh et al., 2008, Singh et al., 2005). Polymer composite materials are also attractive candidate materials for radiation shielding, and many investigations have been progresses so far (Ni et al., 2016, Li et al., 2017, Chang et al., 2015, Mann et al., 2015). A study on bismuth oxide filled isophthalic resin based polymer composite reported to be an effective gamma radiation shielding material (Ambika et al., 2017). Flexibility of shielding material could provide a better protection against radiation. It should be kept in mind that flexible nature of some polymeric materials could provide a good basis for the safe shielding of electromagnetic radiations.
As it is well known, boron is used for neutron shielding. A study reported the borosilicate glass powder for neutron shielding (Jang et al., 2017). In another study, boron trioxide was added to EPDM (Özdemir et al., 2017) and natural rubber (Ninyong et al., 2017) for neutron shielding purpose. Water is also used as moderator for the neutron particles thanks to presence of hydrogen in its structure.
Gamma and neutron radiations could be present together in radiation sources either due to the inherent nature of radiation source that emits both of the radiation types or radiation device could contain separate radiation sources that emit different radiation types for the purpose of application. In the present study, flexible rubber based material was developed to shield both gamma rays and neutron particles. The developed flexible material developed could be used during intervention actions to a radiation accident or for any other purposes that requires shielding of different ionizing radiation types. Polydimethylsiloxane was used as a matrix material of the composite due to its suitable properties such as elasticity, high ignition temperature. Bismuth oxide was used for X/gamma ray shielding. Boron trioxide, one of the oxides of boron and an economical alternate was chosen as neutron absorber. Other filler material chosen was hexagonal boron nitride. The rationale behind for selection of hBN was to achieve neutron attenuation due to its boron content and its structure. Hexagonal boron nitride has a structure that is similar to that of graphite, and graphite is used as a neutron moderator for reactors (Baker, 1970); thus, the mentioned fillers were expected to act as efficient neutron moderators. In addition, the composite material contains hydrogen that can act as neutron moderator.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Material production
2.1.1. Materials
The silicone used was polydimethyl siloxane and it was a product of Wacker with trade name of Elastosil R 401/20. The crosslinking agent used has a chemical formula of 2,5-bis-(tert-butylperoxo)− 2,5 dimethylhexane and it was a product of Wacker with trade name of Elastosil AUX Crosslinker C6. Hegzagonal boron nitride (hBN) was purchased from Bortek Ltd. Sti., Turkey. Bismuth (III) oxide (Bi2O3) was obtained from MERCK. In addition, boron (III) oxide (B2O3) was obtained from Eti Boron Company (Turkey).
2.1.2. Preparation of 3-layered composite material
The silicone was compounded with crosslinking agent in a HL-66 model, Baihong Machinery mark two roll mill equipment. Then, silicone compound divided into three pieces and each piece were incorporated with Bi2O3, hBN and B2O3. 3 different compounds were homogenized and sheet shaped using two roll mill equipment and finally 3 different sheet shaped layers each of which containing Bi2O3, hBN and B2O3 were achieved. Layers were laminated and were cured in a hydraulic press at 165 °C for 15 min under a 20 MPa pressure within a mold of 2 mm thickness. This procedure was carried out for 9 different composites- sets and content of the samples for each set is given in Table 1. Finally, nine different set of 3-layered composite with surface area of 15 × 15 cm2, each of which was 50 g, were prepared.
Table 1. Content of the samples for each set.
Set 1	Set 2	Set 3	Set 4	Set 5	Set 6	Set 7	Set 8	Set 9
Bi2O3 content in the Bi2O3 layer	10	10	10	20	20	20	30	30	30
B2O3 content in the B2O3 layer	10	14	20	10	14	20	10	14	20
hBN content in the hBN layer	10	10	10	10	10	10	10	10	10
2.1.3. Moving die rheometer tests
Vulcanization curves and rheological parameters obtained by using MonTech mark MDR 3000 model Moving Die Rheometer equipment at 165 °C for each of 9 sets of composite materials. Approximately 4 g-silicon rubber composite samples were cured.
2.2. Mechanical and thermal tests
Mechanical tests were done with a Shimadzu AGS-X Series universal test machine having a 10 kN load cell and 50 mm/min displacement rate according to ASTM D395. Mechanical tests were carried out for both irradiated and non-irradiated samples.
TGA/DTA analysis were carried out between 25 and 750 °C with 10 °C/min heat rate under nitrogen atmosphere. Setaram Labsys model thermogravimetric analyzer was used for TGA tests.
2.3. Irradiations, neutron and X-ray attenuation tests
9 sets of composite materials were cut into dog-bone shape and the dog bone shaped samples were irradiated with a 40 and 80 kGy radiation doses using an AECL Gammacell 220 type irradiator for a period of 90 and 189 days, respectively, for each irradiation dose. Dose rate and decay shame of irradiation source is given in Fig. 1 and area under the decay line is irradiation dose that the samples exposed during irradiation period. Irradiation time required to achieve the set level of total doses were calculated using integral calculation. Change in mechanical and thermal properties of samples with gamma irradiation was investigated using tensile test and TGA.

Thermal neutron attenuation tests were performed with a Pu-Be radiation source. Pu-Be neutron source is placed in the center of barrel which is composed of paraffin and lead. Neutron dose rates were measured by POLIMASTER mark PM1401K Multi-purpose hand held radiation monitor. The device contains a GM tube, a CsI scintillation detector and a LiI neutron detector. The experimental set up for neutron attenuation test is given in Fig. 2. The samples used for the neutron attenuation tests was composed of 3 layers and the samples have a thickness of about 20 mm.

X-ray attenuation tests were carried out according to IEC 61331-1 and I/I0 values were recorded along with the corresponding lead equivalent thickness (mmPb) values. X ray attenuation tests were done for the Bi2O3 layer only, since other layers do not function as a shielding material for X/gamma rays. Thickness of separate Bi2O3 layers used in the attenuation tests was about 6.1–6.3 mm.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Moving die rheometer test results
Vulcanization curves are given in Fig. 3. It was seen that sample of set 9 had highest maximum torque (MH) value, and sample of set 4 had a lowest maximum torque (MH) value. All 9 sets had a minimum torque (ML) range between 0.25 and 0.75 dNm and a maximum torque (MH) range between 0.75 and 2 dNm. Minimum torque (ML) was encountered between the time range of about 0.3–0.4 min as given in Fig. 3. Moreover, it was clear from the Fıgure 3 that crosslinking reactions were started for all sets of samples after the ML point. Torque values of all samples increased as shown in Fig. 3.

Set 2	4.05
Set 3	6.49
Set 4	2.14
Set 5	4.06
Set 6	5.51
Set 7	4.22
Set 8	4.14
Set 9	5.36
3.2. Mechanical properties of rubber composites
Test results for mechanical tests of 9 sets of composites are given in Fig. 4. It was seen that the sets 7,8,9 have resulted with a similar mechanical properties, and this was not the case for sets of 1,2,3 and 4,5,6. In addition, it was seen that elastic modulus of sets 7,8,9 was higher than that of sets of 1,2,3, and 4,5,6. It should be noted that sets 1,2,3 have same Bi2O3(10%) and hBN(10%) contents, and this was the case for sets of 4,5,6 (20% Bi2O3 10% hBN) and 7,8,9 (30%Bi2O3 10% hBN). Both of set 2 within the sets of 1,2,3, and set 5 within the sets of 4,5,6 have the higher elastic modulus and stress at break values. The reason for this could be ascribed to the same content of B2O3 (14%) for these two sets namely set 2 and set 5.

3.3. Mechanical properties of rubber composites after irradiation
Samples of set 1, set 5 and set 9 were chosen for irradiation and this represents the contents within all 9 sets. Mechanical properties of the samples are given in Fig. 5. It is clear from Fig. 5(a) that elastic modulus increased with irradiation due to the degradation of polymeric chains that ends up with a more elastic structure of polymer. Increase of stress at break and maximum force at 40 kGy irradiation case, Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 5(e) respectively, could be due to restructuration of the polymeric chains that led to increase in stress at break. However, decrease of stress at break with further irradiation with 80 kGy shows radiation degradation of the polymeric sets due to chain scission. Percentage strain at break, Fig. 5(c), decreased due to deterioration of the polymeric structure. Similarly, decrease of energy to break, Fig. 5(d), is another result of chain scission within the polymeric matrix.

3.4. TGA/DTG test results
TGA and DTG test results are given in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. T50 is the temperature at which 50% of initial weight remains during the TGA test. Weight loss for different rubber composites and T50 values are given in Fig. 6(a). Weight loss percentage of all samples were ranged in between 60% and 75%. In addition, rate of weight loss (change in weight percent divided by the change in the time) for six different rubber composites are shown in Fig. 6(b). As it is clear from Fig. 6(b), the main weight loss was observed between 350 and 650 °C for all samples. Three weight loss peaks were observed, the fırst one, that was relatively small, was observed to occur between 100 and 200 °C, the second peak was observed at about 400 °C, whereas the third one occurs at about 550 °C. The first weight loss peak ascribed to the volatile components within the composite matrix. Comparison of TGA thermograms before and after irradiation are given in Fig. 6(c). Weight loss value of samples was between 65% and 70%. It was seen that thermal properties were not changed very abruptly with irradiation dose studied.

3.5. Thermal neutron and X-Ray attenuation test results
Thermal neutron attenuation test results are given in Table 3. For this tests thickness of the samples was about 18–20 mm since the sample thickness of 2 mm would not be sufficient enough to attenuate thermal neutrons. Thickness of the sets used in the attenuation test are also given in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3 attenuation rate was between 69% and 71%. However, increase of the hBN content from 10% to 30% for set 9 decreased I/I0 value from 70% to 30.8%, this is a dramatic decrease in the attenuation ratio due to effective neutron shielding of the hBN.

Samples	Thickness (mm)	Neutron attn. (%) [(I/I0) × 100]
Set 1	20.3	71.2
Set 2	18.5	69.3
Set 3	18.4	69.1
Set 4	20.4	71.0

X ray attenuation test results, Bi2O3 layer thickness and corresponding lead equivalent values are given in Table 4. The attenuation ratio (I/I0) decreased from 31% to 5.8% with increase of the Bi2O3 content in Bi2O3 layer from 10% to 30% respectively. The lead equivalent thickness (mmPb) also increased from 0.06 mm to 0.35 mm with increase of Bi2O3 content from 10% to 30%.

Set 7/8/9-Bi2O3 layer	6.3	5.8	0.35
4. Conclusions
In this study, a flexible rubber based 3-layer composite material was developed to shield both gamma rays and neutron particles. Irradiations shown that radiation degradation of polymeric materials and doses used for irradiations was higher than the doses that would be exposed during service life of the developed material. Attenuation tests revealed that developed material with layered structure could attenuate either neutrons and gamma rays. The flexibility of any shielding material is important especially during intervention actions to radiation incidents and accidents. In this regard, the developed material could be a good tool for intervention actions. Increase of hBN content dramatically decreased neutron attenuation rate from 70% to 31% for Set 9.
