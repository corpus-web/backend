Abstract
Cobalt oxide in spinel structure (Co3O4) is an efficient catalyst for ethanol oxidation due to its potential as an oxygen source. To enhance the catalytic performance, Co3O4 is dispersed on silica (SiO2). The degree of dispersion and form of oxides on the support depend on the preparation method. The objective of this work is to compare physicochemical properties and catalytic performance in ethanol oxidation of silica-supported cobalt catalysts from different preparation methods. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IP), precipitation with reverse micelle (RM), and precipitation with NH4OH (PN) methods. The forms and dispersion of cobalt species were investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The cobalt species from RM and IP methods were mainly Co3O4, but that from PN method was the mixed phases of Co3O4, CoO and Co2SiO4. The RM method provided the best dispersion of Co3O4, surface Co3+ and lattice O2− on SiO2. Consequently, the catalyst from RM method provided the highest ethanol conversion and CO2 yield from all temperature ranges.

1. Introduction
In the application in fuel, ethanol (EtOH) is blended with gasoline with various ratios to increase the octane number (Anderson et al., 2010). However, there is a report that ethanol could be a pollutant when it is emitted from low efficient vehicles (Shing et al., 2002). Incomplete combustion of ethanol produces toxic compounds such as CO and acetaldehyde (C2H4O) (Shing et al., 2002). To minimize incomplete combustion, an active catalyst for ethanol oxidation in the automotive exhaust pipe is necessary (Jirátová et al., 2019).
Metal oxides are examples of catalysts for ethanol oxidation. Cobalt oxide in spinel phase (Co3O4) shows the highest capacity as an oxygen source for ethanol oxidation (Rintramee et al., 2012). Hyman and Vohs, (2011) have revealed that an active species for the complete oxidation of ethanol was only observed in Co3O4 when compared with CoO and Co metallic. The Co3+ species in Co3O4 stores abundant surface lattice O2− that plays an essential role in the oxidation of toluene and propane, giving a faster reaction rate (Bai et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013).
To improve the catalytic performance, one could disperse Co3O4 on support materials with a large surface area such as silica (SiO2) (Khodakov et al., 2007). However, strong interaction with the support resulted in the formation of undesired species such as CoO and Co2SiO4. The quality of dispersion and the desired form of cobalt species on the support depended on the preparation method (Zhu et al., 2013).
There are several methods to disperse active catalyst species on supports. Incipient wetness impregnation (IP) is a conventional and widely used method because it is straightforward and convenient to vary the metal loading. The method could be simply performed by mixing a solution of cobalt salt with dry porous support. The solution diffuses inside the pores of the support before the subsequent heat-treatment process. Although the IP method is simple, the weak interaction between the metal precursor and the support could result in an aggregation of the active phase during heat treatment (Khodakov et al., 2007). Therefore, there is still the need for an alternative method to produce a better dispersion and the formation of pure phase Co3O4.
From our previous work, we compared the preparation method of cobalt in metallic form on SiO2 between IP and precipitation by reverse micelle (RM) methods, also called water-in-oil (w/o) method (Osakoo et al., 2013). The RM method involves a collision between droplets of cobalt salt and precipitating agent to produce precipitates (Khodakov et al., 2007). From the RM method, the dispersion of Co on SiO2 is better than that from the IP method. However, such dispersion was not suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), the process to produce large hydrocarbon compounds from CO and hydrogen. The smaller crystal size of Co provided the lower FTS activity (Osakoo et al., 2013). The desired dispersion should give better performance in a fast reaction, particularly, ethanol oxidation. Consequently, the goal of this study is to explore the properties and performance of those cobalt catalysts in ethanol oxidation. Moreover, the catalysts from IP and RM method are compared with that from simple precipitation (PN) of cobalt precursor by ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH as the precipitating agent. A similar concentration of metal salt and precipitating agent solution to the RM method was applied for comparison.
Elucidation of the properties of all cobalt oxide species generated on support is the key to understand the role of the catalysts on ethanol oxidation. There are several powerful techniques to identify metal oxide species in either amorphous or crystalline forms, even the case of high dispersion and small particle size around 1 or 2 nm (Moreau et al., 2013; Khodakov et al., 2007). Those techniques are X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS).
The intention of this work is to compare the physicochemical properties of cobalt oxide supported on SiO2 prepared by IP, RM, and PN. The oxide properties of the catalysts were intensively characterized by XAS (including XANES, EXAFS) and XPS. Other techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (ED-XRF) were employed for comparison. Finally, the influence of the catalyst preparation method on ethanol oxidation was studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The SiO2 support with 0.5 g/cm3of pore volume, 2–4 μm of pore diameter and surface area (190 m2/g) (Chemiewerk Bad Köstritz Gmbh) was dried and used as a support for all catalysts. The catalysts with 10 wt%. Co were prepared by IP, RM, and PN methods. The IP and RM catalysts were prepared according to literature (Osakoo et al., 2013). The PN catalyst was prepared by adding an aqueous solution containing 1.609 g of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25% NH3, BI-Laboredarfslager) as a precipitating agent in 10.342 g of water to a beaker of an aqueous solution containing 1.715 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%, Riedel-de Häen) in 10.710 g of water. Then, SiO2 was added into the mixture and stirred with a constant speed of 350 rpm for 3 h, filtered, dried at room temperature overnight and at 100 °C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained powder was calcined in air at 300  for 3 h. After being calcined, all catalysts were named according to the preparation method: IP, RM, and PN, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Phase and crystallinity of catalysts were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα X-ray generated with a current of 40 mA and a potential of 40 kV at room temperature. The range scan was from 15° to 80° with 1 s/step.

where D is the mean crystallite diameter, λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54056 Å), and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense Co3O4 diffraction peak at 2θ = 36.9°.
The content of cobalt was analyzed by ED-XRF on Horiba (model XGT 5200). Each sample (0.35 g) was pressed in a sample holder by a thin glass to produce a smooth outer surface. The measurement was done using the Rh X-ray tube operated with the current of 1 mA and the voltage of 30 kV, and equipped with the Peltier cooled silicon drift detector (SDD). The quantification of cobalt content was obtained from the calibration of CoO standard.
The functional groups of the catalysts were studied by FTIR (PerkinElmer, Spectrum GX). Each sample powder was diluted 1/100 in dry KBr, dried at 110 °C for 10 h, then pressed into pellets immediately before analysis (Osakoo et al., 2015).
Moreover, the form of cobalt in the catalysts was characterized by XPS on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II XPS system (ULVAC-PHI, Japan) with Al Kα radiation with the energy of 1486.6 eV as the excitation source. It is a lab-based instrument located at the SUT-NANOTEC-SLRI XAS beamline 5.3 facility, Synchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization), Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. During the measurement, the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) as a reference.
Concurrently, the state and local environment of cobalt after calcination were studied by XAS at the SUT-NANOTEC-SLRI XAS beamline 5.2, Synchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization), Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. The XANES and EXAFS spectra of Co K-edge were recorded at room temperature in transmission mode. Each sample powder was weighted with a similar amount (0.25 g) which was made without any diluent, pressed into pellets and attached in a frame covered by polyimide tape and mounted onto a sample holder. The photon energy was calibrated by a Co foil at 7709 ± 0.3 eV. The quantity of each cobalt form was estimated by Linear Combination Analysis (LCA) of XANES spectra in Athena program from Demeter version of 0.9.25. The LCA was processed on normalized spectra with energy ranging from −20.00 to 30.00 eV from the edge energy.
2.3. Catalytic testing for ethanol oxidation
The catalysts were tested on ethanol oxidation in a plug-flow fixed-bed reactor at the temperature range of 100–400 °C and atmospheric pressure. Each catalyst was pressed and sieved to get 250–425 m particle size, placed in a quartz tube (catalyst weight = 100 mg). Before the catalytic testing, all catalysts were pretreated in N2 at 300 °C for 2 h to remove physisorbed gases. Ethanol vapor was generated by feeding ethanol with a syringe pump (1.0 ml/h) to a tube furnace which was heated at 90 °C and mixed with synthetic air (97 ml/min) before entering the reactor. The concentration of ethanol in the gas feed was 6.7 mol %. After maintaining the stable gas flow rate and temperature, the reactant gases and products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SRI 310C GC) equipped with a column filled with Porapak S (80–100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector using He as carrier gas (Saceda et al., 2012). The conversions of ethanol were calculated from Eq. (2) where [Et]in and [Et]out are moles of ethanol entering and leaving the reactor, respectively. The yields of CO2 were calculated using Eq. (3) based on the mole of CO2 at complete oxidation of ethanol from theoretical value against the mole of CO2 obtained from reaction calculated based on the calibration curve.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
XRD patterns of calcined catalysts prepared from PN, RM, and IP methods are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of all catalysts were similar to that of Co3O4 with the peak at 2θ = 31.3°, 36.9°, 45.1°, 59.4° and 65.4° which are characteristic of Co3O4 spinel [JCPDS PDF No.42–1467]. The peak intensities were in the following order of IP > RM > PN. The average crystal size of Co3O4 spinel calculated from Scherrer equation was in the order of IP > PN > RM (Table 1). The smaller crystal size could imply better dispersion. Note that peak intensities and crystallite size between RM and PN are not in the same order. The consequence could be either from the lower content of Co3O4 phase in PN suggested by LCA in Fig. 5c or the effect of the preparation method. This assumption is in good agreement with the report of Zhu et al. (2013). They have reported that XRD peak intensities and crystallite sizes of Co3O4 vary with the preparation method. However, the cobalt content of each catalyst analyzed by XRF was comparably similar (Table 1). This suggests the similar loading of catalysts are employed on the catalytic activity of ethanol oxidation.

Two absorption bands at around 658 and 569 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of Co–O bond in tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ and octahedral coordinated Co3+, respectively in the Co3O4 spinel lattice (Osakoo et al., 2015; Taghavimoghaddam et al., 2012).

XPS spectra of Co 2p3/2, O 1s, and Si 2s are demonstrated in Fig. 3a, 3b, and 3c. The surface chemical states data of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1. All samples displayed peaks between 778 and 783 eV corresponding to Co 2p3/2 spin-orbital peak of Co3O4. The deconvolution of each main peak provided two sub-peaks at 779.3 and 780.8 eV (see Fig. 3a), which were assigned to the binding energies of Co3+ and Co2+, respectively (Zhu et al., 2013 and Yalovega et al., 2019). To distinguish the relative content of surface Co3+ species in Co3O4 prepared from different methods, the relative ratio of Co3+/(Co3+ + Co2+) was calculated and included in Table 1. The relative ratio of Co3+/(Co3+ + Co2+) values obtained from XPS was in the order of RM > IP > PN, a similar trend with the result from TPR. Therefore, the results led to the conclusion that the preparation method affected the surface content of Co3+ in the catalysts (Zhu et al., 2013).

There are some limitations on the obtained Co3+/(Co2+ + Co3+) ratios from H2-TPR technique. Since there are some trace amounts of unreduced cobalt oxides in the core particle as suggested by Lukashuk et al. (2016). Consequently, the obtained Co3+/(Co2+ + Co3+) ratios are lower than the theoretical value (0.33).
Additionally, the XPS technique provides oxidation state information of metal oxides in the surface layer. Thus, the obtained Co3+/(Co2+ + Co3+) ratios are larger than the bulk. This remark is consistent with the report of Chen et al. (2011) that the Co3+/(Co2+ + Co3+) ratios in the surface layer of Co3O4 on SiO2 prepared by impregnation and impregnation combined with ethylene glycol pretreatment were 0.47 and 0.63, respectively. Those catalysts were also characterized by XPS.
The deconvolution of the O 1s is shown in Fig. 3b. XPS spectrum of all catalysts consisted of three peaks: α around 529 eV, β at 532.1 eV, and γ at 533.2 eV. Those peaks corresponded to the surface lattice O2− of Co3O4, characteristic of single-bonded oxygen in Si–O–Si of SiO2 support and chemisorbed oxygen and/or Si–O–H (Zhu et al., 2013; Valero-Romero et al., 2016). Interestingly, the binding energy of the α peak in each preparation method was different and in the order of IP > PN > RM. Moreover, the relative content of lattice O2− of Co3O4 (α) from the RM was larger than that from other methods (see Table 1). Li et al. (2011) have suggested that the plentiful lattice O2−of metal oxides surface could enhance the activity for ethanol oxidation due to abundant oxygen storage capacity.
Besides, the relative dispersion of surface cobalt oxide on SiO2 was calculated from the intensity of Co 2p3/2/intensity of Si 2s from XPS (see Fig. 3c) (Brabant et al., 2017). The dispersion of surface cobalt oxide in Table 1 obtained from XPS, was in the order of RM > PN > IP, consistent with the XRD results.
XANES spectra of all catalysts compared with Co3O4 and Co2SiO4 standard materials are shown in Fig. 4. The values of pre-edge, K-edge and shift of K-edge from that of the Co foil are listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Data. Spectra of all reference materials including Co foil, CoO, Co3O4, Co2SiO4 can be found in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data. Typically, a shift of the peak position and the feature in the XANES spectra of metal could suggest the change in the oxidation state and local environment (Tangwatanakul et al., 2017). The XANES spectra of the IP and RM (Fig. 4) were similar to that of Co3O4 and the edge shifts were nearly the same (Table S1). These results suggested that Co3O4 was formed mainly after calcination. In other words, the XANES spectrum of the PN did not match well to that of Co3O4 standard. It was likely similar to the mixed XANES spectra of Co3O4, CoO and Co2SiO4. In addition, the edge position of the PN was between that of Co3O4, CoO and Co2SiO4 (Table S1), indicating the existence of the mixed phases.
Fig. 4. The XANES spectra of Co K-edge of catalysts prepared from IP, RM and PN methods, Co3O4 and Co2SiO4 standards.
Besides the edge position, each spectrum had a pre-edge, which is a small peak before the rise of the edge. It corresponds to an electron transition from 1s to 3d orbital which is typically dipole-forbidden but becomes possible when the metal has tetrahedral coordination (Khemthong et al., 2010). The pre-edge provides information on the structure (Orpe et al., 2017; Tangwatanakul et al., 2017). In bulk Co3O4 with spinel structure, there are two-third of Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination site and one-third of Co3+ in octahedral coordination site. However, those relative ratios varied with preparation methods due to the change of dimension, morphology, and dispersion (Bai et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). When the metal oxide present in the same form, the intensity of the pre-edge peak could correlate to the quantity of Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination. The pre-edge intensity of IP was higher than that of RM sample implying the more amount of Co2+ in the tetrahedral coordination, consistent with H2-TPR and XPS results. In the case of PN, it is difficult to compare due to the presence of mixed Co3O4, CoO and Co2SiO4 phases.
Thus, the Linear Combination analysis (LCA) was employed to estimate the relative quantity of oxide species (Orpe et al., 2017) as shown in Fig. 5a, b, and 5c. From the LCA result, the form of oxide species in IP and RM was mainly Co3O4, but that in PN was Co3O4 (~43%), Co2SiO4 (~42%) and CoO (~15%). The evidence was consistent with the TPR profile of the PN catalyst, which showed the reduction peaks of CoO and Co2SiO4 at high temperatures (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data) (Santos et al., 2012; Osakoo et al., 2015).
Fig. 5. The XANES spectrum of Co K-edge of catalysts prepared from IP, RM and PN methods compared with the spectrum obtained from linear combination analysis (LCA).
The formation of Co2SiO4, trace amount in RM and a large amount in PN could be from a strong interaction between Co2+ in solution and the silica support. This is probably from different electrostatic interaction caused by the different pH of metal salt solution, namely, 3.2, 7.3 and 9. 8 for IP, RM, and PN, respectively. Khodakov et al. (2007) have reported that the distribution of Co2+ ion on the silica support was electrostatic interactions which could be affected by the pH of the metal salt and/or the mixture of the metal salt and precipitating agent solution. This behavior was the effect of the points of zero charge (PZC). The PZC of silica was at the pH of 2 (Zanella et al., 2005). When the pH of metal cation solution is higher than that of silica at PZC, the surface silica becomes more negative charge due to an enlargement of the protonated silanol (Si–OH). The consequence could facilitate a strong interaction between Co2+ ion and silica surface leading to the formation of CoO and Co2SiO4. In addition, the pH of Co2+ ion solution was higher than 9, resulting in more formation of Co2SiO4 and CoO species on SiO2 after calcination in air (Mäki-Arvela and Murzin, 2013; Tsoncheva et al., 2012).
Although the large relative amount of Co2SiO4 and a trace amount of CoO species in PN were not observed by XRD, it was suggested by XANES. This observation indicated that these phases could be either an amorphous or crystalline with a particle size of less than 5 nm (Dong et al., 2018). Holder and Schaak (2019) have suggested that particles having a crystalline domain size less than 5 nm were not suitable for the analysis by XRD due to both broad peaks and low signal-to-noise ratios. Thus, the XAS technique has an advantage that allows the detection of the Co2SiO4 species in RM and PN catalysts and CoO species in PN.
Fourier-transformed data of the XAS spectrum in the EXAFS region is shown in Fig. 6. The Co3O4 oxide species of all catalysts exhibited different amplitudes. In comparison between IP and RM methods on the formation of Co3O4, the higher backscattering amplitude of Co–Co in IP could imply the larger particle size (Kuzmin and Chaboy, 2014). The backscattering amplitude of Co–Co from PN was lower than those of IP and RM, probably due to a lower amount of Co3O4 which was suggested by XANES and H2-TPR. In other words, the form of Co2SiO4 species could present in the amorphous phase resulting in lower amplitudes of Co–O and Co–Co of the mixed cobalt oxides (Moreau et al., 2013). In addition, there is a report that the amorphous Co2SiO4 on SiO2 is transformed to crystalline phase by calcination in air at a temperature of over 700 °C (Stoia et al., 2010). In the present work, all samples including PN were calcined at 300 °C for 3 h. Thus, the phase of Co2SiO4 is amorphous rather than crystalline.

3.2. Catalytic testing for ethanol oxidation
The catalytic performance in term of ethanol conversion versus the temperature is shown in Fig. 7a. The RM catalyst exhibited the best activity providing a complete ethanol conversion and the fastest reaction rate. Such a result could be the consequence of the better dispersion of Co3O4 on SiO2, richer surface Co3+ and lattice O2− of Co3O4 (Zhu et al., 2013; Bai et al., 2013). In another observation, the ethanol conversion from PN was slightly lower than that from IP in spite of the better dispersion of cobalt oxides species. This might due to the smaller Co3O4 content which led to the less number of active sites.
Fig. 7. Ethanol conversion (a) and CO2 yield (b) of catalysts prepared from IP, RM and PN methods.
The yields of CO2 from the catalytic oxidation overall catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7b. The CO2 yields increased with temperature but decreased after 300 °C in all catalysts. The highest CO2 yield produced at a lower temperature was observed in the RM method probably due to the greater active sites, surface Co3+ and lattice O2− in Co3O4 structure. This remark is in good agreement with the report from Li and Wang (2016) which shows the reaction mechanisms and catalytic activity of ethanol oxidation over Co2+, and Co3+ in Co3O4 structure by computational simulation. They have found that the temperature of CO2 generated on Co3+ site is significantly lower than that on Co2+ site, namely, 220 °C and 310 °C, respectively. Such behavior is the consequence of a lower barrier of the CO2 formation on the Co3+ site, suggesting that CO2 was mainly formed on the Co3+ site.
It is worth noting that the decrease of CO2 yield at the temperature over than 300 °C could be from two reasons. First, there was a further reaction between CO2 and H2 from ethanol decomposition to produce CO and H2O (Rintramee et al., 2012). Second, the Co3O4 was reduced by ethanol to CoO particles and became the active site for ethanol steam-reforming reaction suggested by Llorca et al. (2004).
However, in practice for cold start condition, the high catalytic activity on ethanol oxidation and CO2 yield generated at a lower temperature on RM catalyst would be more beneficial from 180 °C to 240 °C. As the active temperature range in an automotive catalytic converter is over 320 °C, the pollutants could be emitted from the tailpipe at the temperature range of 30 – 230 °C (Yusuf and Inambao, 2019).
Based on the results above, RM is the best preparation method because it provides Co3O4 phase with the greater amount of surface Co3+, lattice O2− in Co3O4, and better dispersion on SiO2. These properties played an important role in ethanol oxidation providing high activity due to the excellent redox properties of Co3O4. Finocchio et al. (1997) have reported that the Co3O4 served as nucleophilic oxygen species (O2−) at the surface, associated with the presence of trivalent cobalt (Co3+). Thus, cations (Co3+) in Co3O4 could function as oxidizing species and the oxygen inserted into the product is from the oxide surface (Finocchio et al., 1997; Jirátová et al., 2019).
4. Conclusions
Catalysts consisting of cobalt oxides supported on SiO2 are prepared by reverse micelle (RM), impregnation (IP) and precipitation with NH4OH (PN). Characterization by several methods including XANES, EXAFS and XPS led to understanding about the influence of the preparation method to the properties of cobalt oxides, particularly, form and dispersion. The RM and IP methods generated mainly Co3O4 species on SiO2, while the PN method produced the mixed phase of Co3O4, CoO and Co2SiO4. The crystal size of Co3O4 was in the order of IP > PN > RM. The relative dispersion of Co3O4 on SiO2 was in the order of RM > PN > IP. In catalytic testing in ethanol oxidation, the activity was the in order of RM > IP > PN. Thus, the RM method is the most effective one to produce Co3O4/SiO2 for ethanol oxidation according to a greater surface Co3+, lattice O2− in Co3O4 structure and dispersion. Hence, the RM method has a potential for further development for ethanol oxidation.
