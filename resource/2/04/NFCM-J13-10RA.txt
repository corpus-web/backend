Abstract
In this paper, two new empirical equations for calculating the effective dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids are presented based on a high number of experimental data available in the literature. These two equations present the effective dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids as a function of the volume fraction (0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 12%), size (10nm ≤ dp ≤ 5μm) and type (Ag, Cu, Al2O3, TiO2, CuO, SiO2, ZnO, MgO, Fe, Fe3O4, Al, AlN, CaCO3) of the nanoparticles, temperature and thermo-physical properties of the base fluid. The proposed models are compared with frequent used models in literature (Brinkman and Maxwell-Garnett models) and found that these classical models severely underestimate the effective viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Two proposed models are also compared with some other theoretical models, as those of Chon, Patel, Corcione, Prasher, Koo, Maiga, Masoumi, etc. The results showed that, present models for spherical nanoparticle are in excellent agreement with experimental data and provide more accurate character predictions for thermos-physical properties of nanofluid in comparison with existing models. In addition, five new equations are also proposed using the least squares method for calculating the viscosity of five common working fluids (Water, Glycerol, Ethylene glycol (EG), Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethanol) as a function of the temperature. Beside the pure comparison between these models, two well-known benchmark cases of conjugate natural (Differentially Heated Cavity) and mixed convection (Two-sided Lid-driven Cavity) of nanofluid are chosen in order to investigate the effects of the volume fraction, size and type of the nanoparticles on the fluid flow and heat transfer performance of nanofluids. Easy to use for numerical simulation purposes, covering a wide range of the solid particle size and having high accuracy in predicting thermos-physical properties of nanofluids make these equations useful and practical for the design of various thermal engineering systems such as heat exchangers.

1. Introduction
Heat exchangers are one of the most common and most important pieces of process equipment which are widely used in industrial systems such as: space heating, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, and sewage treatment. However, low thermal conductivity of traditional liquid coolants (e.g. water, ethylene glycol, oil and propylene glycol) is the most crucial limitation in designing compact heat exchangers. During the past two decades, substantial research efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient working fluid to maximize heat flux removal from thermal-hydraulic systems. It is well known that metals in solid form possess higher thermal conductivity than conventional fluids. Therefore, an innovative way of improving the thermal conductivity of fluids is to suspend small solid particles in the fluids. This idea is not new, in fact it was proposed about one hundred years ago by Maxwell [1] who theoretically showed that the addition of the solid particles into the liquid medium increases its effective thermal conductivity and therefore substantially enhances its heat transfer characteristics. Later on, Davis [2], Hamilton and Crosser (HC) [3], Yu and Choi [4], Wasp and Kenny [5] proposed other analogous versions of Maxwell model for calculating effective thermal conductivity of composite materials. However, suspensions containing relatively large particles (i.e. millimeter and micrometer size particles) cause some severe problems such as: fouling and additional pressure loss in heat exchangers, clogging the tiny channels, erosion of components, abrasion and sedimentation. In addition, Li et al. [6] and Eastman et al. [7] showed that type of the solid particles plays a pivotal role in the enhancement of effective thermal conductivity of the composite and the effect of this factor augments as the particle size decreases. Since, above mentioned models have been developed for composites and mixtures with micro and milli-sized inclusions; therefore it is obvious that the accuracy of such models tends to be diminished as the particle size decreases. The problems associated with larger sized particles had been solved by Choi [8] who introduced the concept of nanofluid through the use of nanoscale particles (commonly between 5 nm to 200 nm). Due to small size and very large specific surface area of the nanoparticles, these special mixtures appear to provide better dispersion behavior, and less clogging and abrasion. Moreover, this new innovative class of solid-liquid composites can offer numerous potential benefits and applications in important fields such as: cooling reactors, solar water heating, improving heat transfer efficiency of chillers, and recently, the cooling of electronic components. Because of wide applications of the nanofluids in various industries, many researchers' attention has focused on the thermos-physical properties of nanofluids. A comprehensive literature survey of experimental and theoretical investigations on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids can be found in the work of Akilu et al. [9] and Vanaki et al. [10]. Their results indicated that, many factors such as: size, volume fraction and thermal property of dispersed particles, temperature of the based fluid, and Brownian motion can influence the thermal property of nanofluids. Over the past two decades, the significant effort has been devoted to provide a more accurate equation for predicting the effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. The models proposed by Jang et al. [11,12], Leong et al. [13], Xue [14], Kumar et al. [15], Prasher et al. [16,17], Koo et al. [18], Xie et al. [19], Patel et al. [20], Ren et al. [21], Murshed et al. [22], Corcione [23], Pal [24] and Chon et al. [25] are just a few examples of such theoretical, empirical and semi-empirical equations which have been published in the literature to describe the thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids. However, the results of Aybar et al. [26] indicated that conventional theoretical and empirical models cannot accurately explain the enhancement of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Following them, many researchers have conducted experimental investigation on the impact of nanoparticle type on the thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with various base fluids and nanoparticles size [27]. Their results revealed that, nanofluid temperature has a small impact on the thermal conductivity of nanofluid compared to volumetric concentration. The comprehensive review and discussion about the effective thermal conductivity of nanofluids can be also found in the work of Yu et al. [28].
Besides the thermal conductivity, viscosity is another fundamental characteristic property of the fluid which can be greatly influenced by the presence of solid particles in the liquid medium. Since viscosity plays a significant role in determining pumping power requirement of any engineering equipment, thus having precise knowledge of behavior of nanofluid viscosity is very important in the design of energy engineering systems such as heat exchangers and cooling systems. For predicting effective viscosity of suspensions, several models exist that describe the relative viscosity as a function of solid particles concentration. In a pioneering work, Einstein [29] presented a novel linear model for determining the viscosity of suspensions of uniform spherical particles. However, his model was restricted to the rheological characteristics of dilute suspensions of rigid and spherical particles and was only as a function of the particle volume fraction (a linear equation) whereas in reality this relationship is nonlinear. Later on, Brinkman [30], Batchelor [31], Guth et al. [32], Thomas et al. [33], Roscoe [34], Eilers [35], Vand [36] and Lundgren [37] took into account the interaction between particles in suspension and generalized the Einstein's work for use with moderate particle concentrations. In the same context, Mooney [38], Simha [39], Metzner [40] and Chong et al. [41] independently proposed some other models for estimating the viscosity of nanofluids. However, all of the studies on viscosity of suspensions have been confined to those produced with millimeter or micrometer sized particles. Recently, the results of Turgut et al. [42], Pak et al. [43] and Maı̈ga et al. [44] vividly showed that, these traditional models underestimate the dynamic viscosity of the nanofluid even for a relatively low particles concentration. Based on these observations, many researchers have been motivated to provide more precise models for the calculation of nanofluids viscosity. The works of Corcione [23], Masoumi et al. [45], Buongiorno [46], Ho et al. [47], Maiga et al. [48], Rea et al. [49], Esfe et al. [50] and Horri et al. [51] are just some example of these models which have been developed in recent years. However, similar to effective thermal conductivity of nanofluids, these models demonstrated large discrepancies among each other which significantly restricting their applicability. Moreover, these models are obtained from a small number of experimental data which severely limits the range of their validity. Similar observation was reported by Mahbubul et al. [52] who performed a comprehensive review of the latest results on the viscosity of nanofluids.
In general, research in the field of nanofluid can be classified into three categories namely: (I) thermo-physical properties of nanofluids, (II) application and (III) heat transfer modeling of nanofluids. As for numerical investigation of nanofluids convection, there are two main approaches (single-phase or two-phase models) which can be applied for simulation of the velocity field, temperature distribution and heat transfer rate of nanofluids. In the single phase method (homogeneous model), it is assumed that the fluid phase and solid particles are in thermal equilibrium and move with the same velocity. Since, this method is simpler and requires less computational time therefore most of the studies in this area have been made using homogeneous model. Kefayati et al. [[53], [54], [55], [56]], Chamkha et al. [57,58] and Ghalambaz et al. [59] numerically investigated the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of natural and mixed convection of nanofluids in square cavities using the single phase method. Their results indicated that, by increasing the Rayleigh number and nanoparticle volume fraction the heat transfer rate increases. However, experimental study of Wen and Ding [60] support the idea that the assumption of homogeneous model may not always be true for nanofluid simulation. They investigated convective heat transfer of nanofluid in a horizontal pipe. They found that, distribution of nanoparticles within the channel is non-uniform which implies that slip velocity between the base fluid and solid particles may not be zero.
Generally, slip velocity can be made through several factors such as: drag force, gravity, Brownian motion and thermophoresis force. Two phase mixture model was reported in the pioneering work by Manninen [61], in 1965 for simulation of dilute suspension of solid particles in liquids. He considered drag and gravity as two important primary slip mechanisms between solid and liquid phases. Alinia et al. [62], Garoosi et al. [63], Mirmasoumi et al. [64,65], Akbari et al. [66,67], Shariat et al. [68,69], Moraveji et al. [70] and Selvakumar et al. [71] numerically investigated mixed and forced convection of nanofluids in different geometries. Their results indicated that, because of the drag and gravity forces effects, solid particles deposited on the bottom surface of the enclosure so that concentration of solid particles in lower half of the enclosure is somewhat higher than the upper one. In addition, they concluded that, the two-phase models represented a better approximation of the experimental data comparing to the single phase model. Few years later, Buongiorno [46] developed a four equation, non-homogeneous equilibrium model for convective transport in nanofluids by considering two other important primary slip mechanisms between solid and liquid phases namely: Brownian motion and thermophoresis force. He stated that, due to the Brownian motion and thermophoresis force, nanoparticles migrate from hot regions to the cold ones, resulting in a non-uniform (inhomogeneous) distribution of nanoparticles. Similar observations were reported by Malvandi et al. [72,73], Kefayati et al. [74] and Sheremet et al. [75,76] who investigated mixed and natural convection of nanofluids in vertical micro-channel and square enclosure, respectively. Sheikhzadeh et al. [77] and Corcione [78] conducted numerical investigations of the natural convection of nanofluid in differentially heated cavity (DHC) using Buongiorno's model. They highlighted that the transport model (Buongiorno's model [46]) predictions are in better agreement with experimental data. This model has been extensively applied to investigate the natural and mixed convection heat transfer of nanofluids by other researchers in different closed enclosures [[79], [80], [81], [82], [83]].
Motivated by these investigations, the main objective of this paper is to introduce and discuss two state-of-the-art empirical equations for estimating the effective viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids based on a wide variety of experimental data available in the literature. The proposed models are then used to calculate the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of nanofluid in two well-known benchmark cases. For this purpose, two different methods of two-phase flow (Buongiorno's model [46] and Manninen's model [61]) are chosen to simulate conjugate natural and mixed convection of nanofluids in rectangular cavities. In the numerical simulation part of this paper, the effects of the pertinent parameters such as: Rayleigh number (104 ≤ Ra ≤ 107), Richardson number (10−2 ≤ Ri ≤ 102), diameter (20nm ≤ dp ≤ 400nm), volume fractions (0 ≤ φ ≤ 0.08) and type of the solid particles (Ag, Cu, AlN, ZnO, and CuO) on the fluid flow and heat transfer rate are carefully examined. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between the more recent models and models obtained from present work has been made in order to gain deeper insight into the thermo-physical behavior of nanofluids and acuracy of the proposed equations.
2. Correlating equations for the effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids
In this section, two new empirical equations are proposed for two important thermophysical properties of nanofluids from a wide variety of experimental data, consisting of the Silver (Ag), Copper (Cu), Copper oxide (CuO), Aluminium (Al), Aluminium oxide (Al2O3), Aluminium nitride (AlN), Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Silicon dioxide (SiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Magnesium oxide (MgO), Iron (Fe), Iron(III) oxide (Fe3O4) and Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) solid particles with the volume fraction and diameter in the range between 0 ≤ φ ≤ 0.12 and 10nm ≤ dp ≤ 5μmsuspended in Water, Glycerol, Ethylene glycol (EG), Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethanol. For any data-set, details on the thermo-physical properties of the solid particles and base fluids, size and volume fraction of the suspended solid particles, and the temperature range, are listed in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3. Using the least squares method (regression analysis), the following mean empirical correlations (Eqs. (1), (2)) with a 4.7% and 2.88% average standard deviation are respectively produced for the effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluids on the basis of 458 sets of experimental data obtained by 54 independent research groups [7,42,47,[84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118], [119], [120]].

In the above equation sets, kp, kf, are the thermal conductivity of the solid particles and base fluid, respectively. dp is diameter of the solid particles and df is the equivalent diameter of a base fluid molecule which can be calculated through the Eq. (3) where M and N are molecular weight of the base fluid and the Avogadro number (N = 6.022 × 1023). In Eq. (1), T0 is the reference temperature (293 K), φ is solid particles concentration, e ≈ 2.718281 is exponential function (Euler's number), ω is correction factors which can be calculated through Eq. (4) [24], and ρf0 in the Eq. (3) is the mass density of the base fluid calculated at the reference temperature (T0 = 293 K). According to the experimental data (as shown in Table 2, Table 3), the above equations are valid for the following ranges of the parameters, 0 ≤ φ ≤ 0.12, 10nm ≤ dp ≤ 5μm, 288K ≤ T ≤ 360K, 1.38 ≤ kp ≤ 429. It should be noted that, within the approximation of Eq. (2), the effective dynamic viscosity of the solid-fluid mixture (μnf/μf) is not the function of the temperature, and this assumption is valid when the variations of the temperature and thermos-physical properties of the working fluid within the computational domain doesn't exceed ΔT ≤ 10∘ where Boussinesq approximation can also be applied for simulation of the buoyancy-driven flows in liquid medium [121]. However, for temperature difference higher than ΔT > 10∘ the effects of the viscosity changes should be taken into account. For this reason, following correlation equations are derived using the least squares method for estimating the viscosity of the working fluid as a function of the temperature for Water, Glycerol, Ethylene glycol (EG), Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethanol.

Fig. 2 clearly demonstrates that once the solid particle material and the base fluid are assigned, the dimensionless effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid (knf/kf), enhances by the increment of volume fraction (φ) and temperature (T) while a reverse trend can be observed as the solid particles diameter (dp) increases. Moreover, it can be seen that, type of the based fluid has a minor impact on both thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancement ratio. With reference to Fig. 2, it is apparent that at the same diameter and volume fraction of the solid particles, variation of the viscosity enhancement is considerably larger than the increase in thermal conductivity ratio. Similar results were also reported by Corcione [23] who proposed two empirical correlations for estimating the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of nanofluids. Another interesting feature is that, since effective viscosity of the nanofluid (μnf/μf) presented in Eq. (2) is independent of the solid particles type, this model can be implemented for any combination of the nanofluid without limitation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 illustrate the comparison of deviation between the experimental measurements and the values predicted by two new empirical equations in this study at different based-fluid, temperature, volume fraction, type and mean diameters of the nanoparticles. It can be seen that, the concordance with the experimental data is reasonably good which indicates that the proposed model could well determine the variation of the effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluid, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, many theoretical studies have been carried out and documented in the literature for determining the thermos-physical properties of nanofluids. A summary of existing theoretical and empirical equations for relative thermal conductivity (Prasher et al. [16], Koo et al. [18], Corcione [23], Chon et al. [25], Xuan et al. [122] and Patel et al. [20,123]) and dynamic viscosity (Chen et al. [114], Maiga et al. [48], Corcione [23], Koo et al. [124], Sharma et al. [125] and Masoumi et al. [45]) of nanofluids which have been extensively used in numerical simulation are listed in Table 4, Table 5, respectively. Comparison of various existing models with previous experimental measurements and proposed models are also depicted in Fig. 5, Fig. 6. It is obvious that, there are conflicting results among the recently conducted models while the proposed models demonstrate excellent agreement with the experimental data and also provide much better precision for estimation of thermal conductivity and viscosity compared with the other models. This observation can be attributed to the fact that, a number of the existing models are developed only for particular type of the nanofluid such that they cannot be generalized to other kind of the solid-liquid mixtures. Another reason is that, some of these equations are correlated through a small number of experimental data which are located in the small range of the validity in term of the volume fraction, diameter and type of the nanoparticles. For instance, Fig. 5 (a-b) shows that the values of relative thermal conductivity predicted by Patel et al. [20,123] and Xuan et al. [122] are much higher than the experimental data for the nanoparticles with the diameter smaller than 33 nm whereas Prasher [16] and Chon's models [25] tend to overestimate the actual thermal conductivity values. As another example, Koo's model [18] demonstrates awkward behavior so that for solid concentration beyond the φ >  % 4, a sharp drop occurs in the values of thermal conductivity ratio. Similar trends can be observed in Fig. 6 where a comparison is made for the most widely used models of nanofluids viscosity. It can be seen that, due to the intense oscillatory behavior in the Masoumi's model [45], this model is fail abundantly when employed for solid particles size lower than the dp ≤ 8nmand also for volume fraction higher than the φ ≥  % 4. It should be noted that, in order to have a proper comparison between the models, the results of Masoumi's model [45] (because of unusual behavior) is eliminated from Fig. 6c to d and also from Fig. 6e to f. It is also evident from Fig. 6 that, Koo [124] and Sharma's models [125] typically underestimate the effective viscosity of the nanofluids compared to other models and experimental data. Another interesting point is that, with all the contradictions that exist among the models, it can be observed that, Chen's model [114] gives better predictions compared to other models for nanofluid viscosity especially for solid particles size in range of the 35nm ≤ dp ≤ 47nm while for nanoparticles diameter outside the given range (dp < 35nm and dp > 47nm), this model also is not able to predict the viscosity of the nanofluids correctly. Finally, Fig. 7 shows comparison between proposed models and two commonly used models of thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid at different size of the solid particles. These two classical models are suggested by Maxwell [1] and Nielsen [126] for the effective thermal conductivity and Brinkman [30] and Mooney [38] for dynamic viscosity of the nanofluid. It should be noted that, although in the literature the works of Nielsen [126] and Mooney [38] are classified as a theoretical models but they correlated their models through experimental data for spherical micrometer-sized particles (for more details see also Pal [24]). Thus, the results of these models can be employed as an experimental data. According to these explanations, Fig. 7 demonstrates that the Maxwell and Brinkman models underestimate the effective thermal conductivities and viscosity of the nanofluids while they are fully consistent with the present models for micro-sized particles (dp = 5μm) which is another validation point of the view for Eqs. (1), (2).

3. Numerical modeling of convection heat transfer of nanofluid
Generally, due to the two-phase nature of the nanofluids, the theory of classical two-phase flow has been typically recommended and employed for simulation of the nanofluids, specifically for those that are composed of solid particles with high concentrations. Thus, in the present study, two different methods of two-phase flows are applied for numerical investigation of nanofluids. The first method is known as non-homogeneous two-component model proposed by Buongiorno [46] where the effects of the Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis are considered as primary slip mechanisms between nanoparticles and based-fluid. The second method is Manninen's two phase model [61] which is one of the most common approaches in modeling micro-and nanofluids in which drag and gravity forces play an essential role in creating a slip mechanism between solid and liquid phases. The governing equations related to these methods are presented in appendices A and B. It should be noted that, all numerical computations are coded using the finite volume method by FORTRAN programming language.
3.1. Problem statement, method of solution and grid-independence study
The fundamental physical model and coordinate system for conjugate natural and mixed convection heat transfer of nanofluids within the rectangular enclosure under consideration are illustrated in Fig. 1.It can be seen from this schematical view that, the impermeable vertical walls of the enclosure are maintained at different but constant temperatures (Th > Tc) while the horizontal walls for both cases 1 and 2 are considered to be insulated. No-slip boundary conditions is implemented for walls of the enclosure except for cases 2A-2D where vertical walls of the enclosure are moving in opposite directions with uniform velocity (±V0) along-y axis. The following assumptions have been intended for analysis of flow behavior and heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids based on the Buongiorno [46] and Manninen's two phase models [61]: the flow is 2D, Newtonian, incompressible and steady, solid particles are uniform in shape (spherical) and size. All the thermo-physical properties of the fluid are assumed to be constant except for the density which varies linearly with the temperature based on the Boussinesq approximation.
Fig. 1. Schematic of the problem and the coordinate system for conjugate natural and mixed convection heat transfer in rectangular enclosure.
The transport equations for a Newtonian fluid along with the boundary conditions are discretized by means of finite volume method (CVFDM) in a staggered grid given by Versteeg et al. [127] where the semi-implicit method for pressure linked equation (SIMPLE) is utilized to handle the pressure-velocity coupling. The diffusive and convective terms are treated with second order centered and third-order QUICK scheme of Leonard [128] to minimize the false diffusion for the convective terms. The solution employs an iterative process based on the TDMA line-by-line method (Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm) until the maximal residual of all variables including: velocity, temperature and volume fraction of nanoparticles in the grid control volume become less than 10−6.
The developed FORTRAN codes were tested for grid independency using six uniform sets of grids: 139 × 69, 177 × 89, 201 × 101, 257 × 129, 297 × 149 and 337 × 169 in which the average Nusselt number on the hot wall of the enclosure was chosen for comparison purposes. It is evident from Table 6 that by further increase in the number of the grids from 297 × 149 to 337 × 169, the values of average Nusselt number don't alter significantly which indicate that selecting and allocating 297 × 149 grids can sufficiently guarantee the precision of the numerical results.

3.2. Code validation
Prior to the simulations, the validation of the present computational codes has been systematically undertaken against three different benchmark solutions.
The validity of the conduction-convection heat transfer part of the code has been demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with the work of Das et al. [129] for conjugate natural convection heat transfer in an inclined square enclosure containing a conducting obstacle (see Fig. 8). The second validation of the numerical code on the basis of two-phase flow model has been performed against the numerical results of Sheikhzadeh et al. [77] who investigated natural convection of nanofluid in a square cavity using Buongiorno's model [46] (see Fig. 9). The validation of Manninen's two phase model part of the study has been verified by reproducing the results of Alinia et al. [62] who numerically studied mixed convection of nanofluid in an inclined enclosure cavity using two-phase mixture model (see Fig. 10). Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 clearly demonstrate that for all values of the Rayleigh and Richardson numbers, the present results are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with those presented in [62,77,129] in terms of streamlines, isotherms, average Nusselt number and nanoparticles distribution.
4. Results and discussion
In this section, numerical analysis of conjugate natural and mixed convection heat transfer in a differentially heated rectangular enclosure has been carried out using two different models of two-phase flow to determine the effects of the Rayleigh number (Ra), Richardson numbers (Ri), volume fraction (0 ≤ φ ≤  % 8), size (20nm ≤ dp ≤ 400nm) and type of the solid particles (Ag, Cu, AlN, ZnO, and CuO) on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids. As mentioned before, Brownian motion and Thermophoresis are two predominant factors in generating slip mechanism between solid and liquid phases. Since, these two parameters are the function of the thermal conductivity of the solid particles and based fluid, therefore it can be concluded that the Buongiorno's model is a reliable and accurate method for investigation the effects of the nanoparticle thermal conductivity (type of the solid particles) on the heat transfer enhancement (see Appendix A). On the other hand, since the slip mechanism in the Manninen's model is greatly influenced by the size of the solid particle, this method has been chosen to study the effects of the nanoparticles diameter on the flow structure and heat transfer rate (see Appendix B).
4.1. Conjugate natural convection heat transfer in rectangular enclosure (Buongiorno's model, cases 1A to 1D)
In this section, four different cases of conjugate natural convection in the differentially heated enclosure are considered to investigate the effects of the various factors such as: Rayleigh number, type of the nanoparticles (Cu, AlN, ZnO and CuO) and number of the conductive partition on the flow pattern, temperature distribution and heat transfer rate of the nanofluids. The thickness of the conductive walls is fixed as L1 = H and L2 = 0.15H for all cases and enclosure is filled with water as a based fluid, with Pr = 3.77 (Th = 324K, Tc = 316K, Tave = 320K). As mentioned earlier, since inclusion effect of four different types of the nanoparticles will be assessed in this section, Buongiorno's two phase model is utilized here to investigate behavior and thermal performance of nanoparticles.
Fig. 11, Fig. 12 demonstrate the effects of the Ra and number of the conductive partitions on the flow and thermal patterns within the enclosure for cases 1A to 1D. Generally, in case 1A, the heated working fluid rises along the hot wall due to its low density, and impinges to the isolated top wall and moves horizontally towards the cold area. As the expanded fluid shifts to the cold wall, its density enhances and the fluid gets heavier and descends rapidly towards the bottom of enclosure. Finally, it moves towards the hot area where the heat cycle is repeated again and consequently the clockwise eddy is formed within the enclosure. As shown in Fig. 11, when Rayleigh number gets larger due to the strong buoyant flow, the fluid motion accelerates and stream lines become more densely packed in proximity of the active walls due to domination of convection mode of heat transfer. Fig. 12 clearly illustrates that, because of high-energy transport through the flow associated with high value of Ra, the isotherms become more clustered and parallel to the horizontal walls of the enclosure which means that buoyancy forces are more dominant than viscose forces in the interior of the enclosure. Fig. 11, Fig. 12 also reveal that how partitioning the enclosure can significantly affect the fluid flow and temperature distributions within the enclosure. It is apparent that, at the constant Ra, by adding the conductive wall in the center of the enclosure (case 1B), the main vortex breaks up into two smaller vortices and consequently the intensity of the streamlines decreases dramatically. It can be seen that, with further increase in number of the partitions, the prevalent influence of conduction mode becomes more palpable, leading to the significant attenuation of flow intensity and postponement of onset of natural convection to the higher values of Ra. For example, examination of Table 7 shows that, the absolute values of stream function |ψmax|which represent the intensity of fluid flow, in case 1A (no partition) for pure fluid (φ = 0) at Ra = 104, 105, 106 and 107 are respectively 10.4, 3.66, 2.06 and 1.99 times higher than that of case 1D (3 partitions) which implies that partitioning the enclosure in the natural convection mechanism tends to suppress the fluid motion and heat transfer characteristic induced by buoyancy force. This influence can also be inferred from Fig. 12 where by increasing number of the partitions, thermal boundary layer thickness adjacent to the isothermal walls increases which causes a notable decline in the temperature gradients and accordingly reduces the heat transfer rate. These results are to be expected since under conduction mode of the heat transfer, some weak circulation structures are established, and thus the isotherm lines become more regular and diluted. Another noticeable feature is that, in case 1D at Ra = 104, due to presence of three conductive walls, heat trapping occurs within the enclosure which indicates that heat energy cannot easily transfer from the left hot wall to the right cold wall (see Fig. 12). In such a case, the fluid flow is totally stagnant in the bulk of the enclosure interior and corresponding isotherm are practically parallel to the vertical walls of the enclosure. It is worthwhile mentioning that in this condition, the average Nusselt number ([Math Processing Error]) can be computed analytically by considering the thermal analogy as follows:

Take as an illustration, based on numerical simulation analyses the values of average Nusselt number for cases 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D (at φ = 0and Ra = 104) are equal to 1.726, 0.918, 0.653 and 0.634, respectively while analytical solution estimates these values around the 0.5, 0.536, 0.578 and 0.626. These obtained results clearly demonstrate that, conduction is the primary mode of heat transfer only in cases 1C and 1D whereas in cases 1B and especially 1A the weak effects of the convection heat transfer still exist within the enclosure. However, as the Ra enhances, the strength of the vortices increases and isotherms become thermally stratified at each section of the enclosure which indicates that heat transfer inside the enclosure is governed mainly by the convection mode. Fig. 12 and Table 7 also demonstrate that how isotherms and absolute values of stream function are drastically affected by dispersing nanoparticles into the based fluid especially at low values of Ra. The reason is that an increase in nanoparticles concentration is equivalent to the lessening of the fluid motion due to the augmentation in the effective viscosity of the working fluid. This, in turn, is accompanied by a progressive reduction in distortion of isotherms and alleviation of thermal mixing within the enclosures. For a better understanding of the participation of the conductive walls and volume fraction of nanoparticles on the heat transfer rate, the average Nusselt number is also analyzed for cases 1A to 1D at different Ra.
Overall evaluation of Fig. 13 illustrates that, the average Nusselt number is an increasing function of Rayleigh number whereas the tendency is greatly affected by partitioning the enclosure. Take as an example, the values of [Math Processing Error] in case 1A with no partitions and φ = 0 at Ra = 104, 105, 106, and 107 are respectively 1.87, 2.25, 2.36 and 2.52 times higher than those associated with case 1B whereas by inserting the second partition into the enclosure this deterioration is elevated by 2.64, 3.51, 3.81 and 4.12 between case 1A and case 1C. Actually, the above results clearly demonstrate that partitioning the enclosure is the most efficient procedure in handling the heat transfer rate in the engineering equipment. In other words, reduction in heat transfer rate is a prominent feature of partitioning such that buoyancy force that driving the fluid flow within the enclosure can be manipulated through presence of the conductive walls. More precisely, it is obvious that partitioning can act as a curtain for heat transport such that by creating a temperature gradient in itself causes a significant drop in effective temperature difference (ΔT) within the enclosure. As a result of this event, isotherms become less clustered and thickness of thermal boundary layer at the vicinity of the heat sources enhances. The growth in the thermal boundary layer thickness is accompanied by the reduction in temperature gradient which in turn is responsible for a decline in the heat transfer rate accordingly. Fig. 13 reveals that this reduction becomes more severe by further increase in the number of the conductive walls so that the stagnant regions eventually start to appear within the enclosure. It is important to note that, in this circumstance, due to the blockage and resistance effects of the conductive wall, heat trapping occurs inside the enclosure so that transition point from conduction to convection mode of the heat transfer is postponed to higher values of Rayleigh number, resulting in a reduced heat transfer rate compared to the case with no partition. Fig. 13 also depicts the effects of the concentration and type of the nanoparticles on the average Nusselt number. It is evident that, the variation of average Nusselt number is comprised of two steps such that with increments of nanoparticles concentration, the [Math Processing Error]initially enhances and attains a maximum value at (φopt) where heat transfer rate is maximized across the whole enclosure and then rapidly decline with adding more nanoparticles into the based fluid. This intriguing phenomenon can be explained by the fact that, dispersion of a progressively larger amount of ultrafine particles into the working fluid typically has two contrasting effects on the heat transfer rate, positive aspect driven by excessive growth in the effective thermal conductivity and an undesirable aspect promoted by significant enhancement in effective viscosity of working fluid (see Fig. 2). Regarding the existence of an optimum values for nanoparticles concentration, it can be mentioned that, the thermal performance of the system is heavily dependent on the strength of these two contradictory factors such that if the negative effects of the viscosity enhancement can conquer the increase in effective thermal conductivity, heat transfer rate will be reduced and vice versa. More precisely, it is evident that, according to the equations of (1), (18A), there is strong positive correlation between normalized thermal conductivity (knf/kf), average Nusselt number ([Math Processing Error]) and the amount of the particles loading (φ) in which by augmenting the volume fraction of nanoparticles, the heat transfer rate will increase. Meanwhile, according to Eq. (2), the addition of nanoparticle augments the effective viscosity which immensely damps the flow penetration within the enclosure through weakening the buoyancy force and consequently attenuates convection effects. The decline in the flow intensity and convection process within the enclosure is accompanied by enhancement in thermal boundary layer thickness which in turn leads to the significant reduction in the temperature gradients on the active walls. It is obvious that any decrement in the temperature gradients is also characterized with lowest rate of the heat transfer and thermal performance of the system. Fig. 12 vividly reflects the effects of this event where isotherms begin to straighten up so that horizontal thermal stratification is replaced by vertical one which is the signs of the conduction amplification and descending the heat transfer rate (to further confirm this statement see also Table 7). By taking into account above explanations and role of the particles presence (negative and positive effects), Fig. 13 exhibits that at Ra = 104, with continuous increase in particle concentration the heat transfer rate enhances monotonically so that peak in the [Math Processing Error]takes place at φ =  % 8 (see cases 1C and 1D) while this course of event doesn't happen in case 1B and especially case 1A. This observation can be attributed to the fact that, since in cases 1C and 1D at low value of Ra, heat transfer is essentially governed by conduction, the negative effects of the viscosity enhancement has a trivial impact on the mechanism of the energy transport, and therefore maximum total heat transfer rate takes place at φ =  % 8. On the other hand, in cases 1A and 1B where regime of the flow and mode of the heat transfer are very sensitive to any variations of thermo physical properties of working fluid, by increasing the volume fraction of solid particles, the undesirable role of the viscosity enhancement become more visible and come into conflict with thermal conductivity augmentation. Thus, the optimal particle loading decreases so that in case 1A not only employing the nanofluid doesn't improve the [Math Processing Error] but also has an inverse impact on it. This scenario will continue and accelerate at moderate Rayleigh number at (Ra = 105), where an order of the magnitude of conduction (viscous forces) is comparable with convection mode (transition point). It can be seen from Fig. 13 that, as the number of the partitions increases, power of the conduction ascends, thereby leading to a significant increment in optimal particle loading from φ =  % 2 in case 1A to φ =  % 8 in case 1D. For greater Rayleigh number values, buoyancy forces start dominating the diffusion forces and hence, heat transfer by convection becomes significant and subsequently φopt is shifted to the higher values. In addition, it can be seen that eq. (1) establishes a positive relationship between type of the solid particles (kp/kf) and effective thermal conductive. Thus, by utilizing the solid particles with low thermal conductivity, heat transfer rate ([Math Processing Error]) reduces due to reduction in thermal conductivity of working fluid (knf/kf). Fig. 13 portrays that with alteration of nanoparticles type from AlN (kp = 180) to CuO (kp = 18) the average Nusselt number and optimal particle loading decreases. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that φopt is directly proportional to Ra and thermal conductivity (kp) of nanoparticles. Fig. 14, Fig. 15 reveal the effects of the partitioning, nanoparticles type and Rayleigh number on the distribution of solid particles. It is evident that, high level of heterogeneity exists in dispersion of nanoparticles with low thermal conductivity so that by altering the type of the solid particles from CuO (kp = 18) to AlN (kp = 180) this non uniformity declines singnificantly. Such behavior can be explained by remarkable reduction in the relative velocity between the base fluid and nanoparticles which is caused by theromophoresis force. More precisely, according to Eq. (8A), as the thermal conductivity of nanoparticles increases, the magnitude of theromophoresis force decreases and consequently relative velocity between two phases which is responsible for non-uniformity in particles dispersion reduces. Reduction in relative velocity implies that both solid and liquid phases move with same velocity, which in turn leads to greater homogeneity in the concentration of nanoparticles. Since theromophoresis force is also a function of the temperature gradient, it causes particles to migrate in direction of the heat transfer from the hot area towards the cold one, resulting in more depletion of them close to the hot walls and significant accumulation on the cold walls. Similar results can be found in works of Buongiorno [46] and Malvandi et al. [72,73] who investigated the effects of the theromophoresis force on the heat transfer rate of Al2O3-water nanofluid. These observations point out that, depletion and aggregation phenomena mainly take place for solid particles with low thermal conductivity (like CuO) which directly leads to low energy conversion efficiency in thermal systems through suppression of heat transfer rate. Note that this behavior is in accordance with the moderate diminution of [Math Processing Error] and φopt in Fig. 13. However, as the Ra increments, strength of the main rotating vortex at each section of the enclosure becomes larger so that suspended particles are trapped in the retention zone and fluid elements outside of the vortex, resulting in considerable disruption in particle flocculation and more uniformity in particle distribution accordingly. Based on the above examination on the role of the Rayleigh number in the distribution of the solid particles, one can expect that partitioning must yield to high level of deviation in the particles distribution from their initial value while such trend is not observed in the results. This behavior can be explain by the fact that, although blockage effect of the conductive walls cause significant drop in the convection strength and flow intensity but at the same time due to considerable reduction in temperature gradient, the effect of the theromophoresis force decreases so that these two factors compensate each other, resulting in negligible change in nanoparticles distribution. Another interesting point that can be understood from Fig. 14, Fig. 15 is that, since the boundary condition and location of conductive walls in all cases are centrosymmetric, any depletion in nanoparticles concentration in particular area is inversely corresponded to aggregation of particles in opposite side. This trend can also be considered as further endorsement in the current work from the mass conservation point of view.

4.2. Conjugate mixed convection heat transfer in rectangular enclosure (Manninen's model, cases 2A to 2D)
The coordinate system of conjugate mixed convection heat transfer in a two-sided lid-driven enclosure considered in this section is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Computations are performed for a wide range of the Reynolds number (U0H/ν), volume fraction (0 ≤ φ ≤  % 8) and size (20, 100, 200 and 400 nm) of the nanoparticles. To generate mixed convection heat transfer within the enclosure, the vertical walls of the enclosure are moving with constant velocity but in different directions. Five different values of Reynolds number (10, 31.62, 100, 316.22 and 1000) are applied to control the magnitude of sliding lids velocity whereas Grashof number is maintained constant at Gr = 104. Based on the above dimensionless parameters, five different values of Richardson number (Gr/Re2) are produced to provide a measure of the importance of the force (Ri < 0.1), mixed (0.1 ≤ Ri ≤ 10) and natural convection (10 < Ri) heat transfer inside the enclosures. As mention before, since the main purpose of this section is to explore the effects of the nanoparticles size on the thermal performance of the nanofluids, thus Manninen's two phase model [61] is used where relative velocity caused by gravity and drag forces can be affected by diameter of solid particles (see Eqs. (6), (7)). It should be noted that, based on the previous section, in order to eliminate the effects of the theromophoresis force on the solid particles behavior, silver (Ag, kp = 429) nanoparticle with high thermal conductivity is employed in current section.
Fig. 16, Fig. 17 display the effects of the Ri and presence of several conductive blocks on the flow structures and temperature patterns for cases 2A to 2D. Generally, depending upon the regime of the flow and Richardson number, two different primary kinds of the counter rotating eddies are likely to develop within the enclosure namely; (a) clockwise vortex due to the formation of the same global ascending/ descending of working fluid characterized by buoyancy force and temperature differences between hot and cold walls (qualitatively similar to the previous section) and (b) anti-clockwise eddy which is mostly influenced by the motion of vertical walls. Hence, the cumulative effects of sliding movement of vertical lids are opposed by buoyancy-driven flow as a result of the differentially heated enclosure. As shown in Fig. 16, at low value of Ri, due to the mechanically induced lids motion, an oval-shaped counter-recirculating vortex is established within the enclosure. Since the fluid core is circulating strongly by the sides of the enclosure and thermal field typically follows the pattern of streamlines, it can be seen from Fig. 17 that, isotherms are stretched towards the left and right walls. High level of temperature compactness adjacent to vertical walls and having a spiral shape at the center of the enclosure indicate that the fluid is well circulated within the medium and accordingly force convection is the principal mode of heat transfer. By shifting the mechanism of the heat transfer to mixed convection through enhancing the Ri to 10, the primary vortex is broken up into three separated cells, leading to creation of two different temperature regions within the enclosure. Two counter-clockwise (CCW) vortexes which are located in the left and right chest of the enclosure are generated by moving lids such that the buoyancy force does not play a crucial role on flow feature in those regions. On the other hand, the large circulating cell with the clockwise rotation (CW) is formed in the middle of the enclosure where natural convection is dominant. The analysis of the isotherms in Fig. 17 shows that, temperature is horizontally stratified at the central region of the enclosure which is analogous to the natural convection heat transfer in differentially heated cavity while hot and cold regions at the vicinity of the left and right walls are signs of the fluid and heat trapping due to the existence of two counter-clockwise vortexes. It is constantly perceived that, as the Ri increases, CW cell start to growth in size and pushes two CCW cells to move towards the hot and cold walls. In this process, intensity of the CW eddy increases and role of the natural convection heat transfer becomes more noticeable. At this Richardson number, isotherms become smoother, evener and more scattered so that the thermal boundary layer along the vertical walls increments in thickness. The examination of Fig. 16, Fig. 17 and Table 8 also demonstrates that at low Ri, by locating the conductive obstacle into the enclosure (case 2B), two secondary small vortexes are established at the bottom and top of the block, resulting in significant suppression in flow intensity. Interestingly, despite the fact that, presence of the conductive obstacle causes an immense drop in strength of the fluid flow but the main eddy which occupy the area between the block and enclosure walls has been mostly generated only by the sliding walls, indicating that shear force is still greater than that of buoyancy force and pure force convection is dominant. This flow structure subsequently creates a thin layer of thermal boundary on the vertical walls, and preserves the sharpness of the temperature gradient in those areas. As the Ri increases up to 10, the effects of the buoyancy force start to come into existence so that the fluid flow becomes weaker and slower within the enclosure, resulting in less condensation of the isotherms and streamlines. Furthermore, at this Richardson number, isotherms are almost linear in conductive body and two additional smaller eddies are formed in bottom left and upper right corners of the obstacle where buoyancy force is strongly in conflict of the shear force. With regards to the horizontal thermal stratification within the working fluid and vertical penetration of heat flow inside the conductive obstacle, it is found that, the effects of the buoyancy force become more amplified by further increments of Ri. Another interesting conclusion that can be drawn from Fig. 17 is that, as the Ri increases, due to blockage effects of the conductive obstacle, the rate of the heat flow that transmit through the obstacle increases which implies that role of the conductive obstacle becomes more active in the heat transfer process. This scenario is continued in case 2C where the initial block is fragmented into two parts. However, the tendency is heavily influenced by more division of the block into the smaller segments (case 2D). It is evident that at Ri = 0.1, due to strong hindering effect of the block's fragmentation and limitation of fluid movement in case 2D, some small inner vortices are created within the enclosure through the interaction between the presence of the conductive blocks and CCW eddy generated by shear force. It is apparent from Fig. 17 that, formation of this multiple eddies considerably affects the temperature field, thermal boundary layer thickness and strength of the flow circulation within the enclosure, which can be further confirmed by the absolute values of stream function provided in Table 8 (compare |ψmax|between cases 2A and 2D at φ = 0). As the Ri enhances, number of the inner cells increases and eventually streamlines take the shape of the combination of the obstacles and enclosure especially at Ri = 100. Corresponded isotherms at this Ri, are generally undistorted and nearly parallel to the vertical walls. This behavior is logical because not only natural convection is dominant but also due to the limitation of space, fluid movement is restrained, resulting in remarkable attenuation in flow intensity and thereby the convection current. In fact, one could conclude that the threshold value of Ri marking the onset of natural convection seems to be attenuated by subdividing of conductive obstacles into the smaller parts. It is noteworthy that, subdivision of conductive block from case 2B to 2C has been accomplished in such a way that, the total volume of solid obstacles is kept constant during segmentation operations. For instance, in cases 2B, 2C and 2D the size of the individual obstacles is equal to L1 = L2 = 0.676H, L1 = L2 = 0.478H and L1 = L2 = 0.204H, respectively such that the total volume across the whole cases is maintained constant namely; ACase 2B = 2ACase 2C = 11ACase 2D where ACase 2B = 0.4575, ACase 2C = 0.2287 and ACase 2D = 0.0416.

To give a quantitative analysis, the variation of average Nusselt number with fragmentation of the obstacle has been depicted in Fig. 18 at various values of Richardson number, volume fraction and diameter of solid particles. The general view of the figure demonstrates that, the average Nusselt number almost augments as Richardson number decreases whereas subdivision of the conductive block has an adverse impact on the heat transfer especially at high values of Ri. For example, subdivision of obstacle leads to a reduction of the heat transfer approximately %2.93, %36.9 and %4.12 at Ri = 1, 10 and 100 respectively (between cases 2A and 2C at φ = 0) while these values are accelerated and elevated around the %22.92, %6.95 and %219.5 between cases 2A and 2D. In fact, it can be concluded from Fig. 18 that, an insertion of the conductive obstacle into the enclosure doesn't have a notable impact on the variations of the average Nusselt number (compare the [Math Processing Error] between cases 2A and 2B) whereas by dividing the block into small segments heat transfer rate decreases, dramatically. Moreover, Fig. 18 shows that at low Ri, by decreasing the size of the solid particles heat transfer rate and φopt increases while at high values of Ri a reverse trend can be observed with a few rare exceptions. Generally, variation of [Math Processing Error] as a function of volume fraction and size of the nanoparticles can be categorized into three different groups namely; (a) in the first group, the positive effects of the thermal conductivity enhancement (knf/kf) is sufficiently large to overcome unfavorable outcomes of the viscosity augmentation (μnf/μf) so that overall heat transfer increases monotonically as the volume fraction and size of the solid particles increases and decreases, respectively (φopt = φmax). In the second group, the effective viscosity augmentation begins to take its negative role so that variation of heat transfer rate is undergone two distinct stages; it initially increases, reaches a peak where maximum heat transfer occurs and then declines by further increment of nanoparticles concentration so that φopt will be located in range of the 0 < φopt < φmax. In this stage, diameter of the nanoparticles plays a crucial role on the φopt because in contrast to previous section that type of the nanoparticles had only influence on the effective thermal conductivity, here as the nanoparticles size decreases, both viscosity and thermal conductivity ratio enhance which make the problem almost imperceptible especially by taking this fact into account that the growth of the effective viscosity is almost higher than that of the effective thermal conductivity. Since obtaining maximum thermal conductivity and minimum viscosity ratio simultaneously can be a formidable task in nanofluids, strength of the fluid flow must be considered as another key factor to make a decision to use the nanofluid. In the last group which is the worst-case scenario and typically happens in low-intensity flow, application of the nanofluid not only does not increase the heat transfer rate, but also leads to a significant reduction in thermal performance of the system and consequently boost the operation and maintenance costs of the system. In this circumstance, there is no optimal particle loading and therefore maximum heat transfer rate occurs for pure fluid φopt = 0. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is evident from Fig. 18 that at low Ri, nanofluids vividly illustrate their superior capability as an alternative media for heat removal from the working fluids which can be used in reactors, electronic equipment, heat exchangers and etc. This is well expected as can be seen from Fig. 16, Fig. 17 and Table 8 that inclusion of solid particles into the based fluid characterizes weak modification of streamlines and flow intensity, whereas temperature field alters more essentially. It can be seen that under this condition, by decreasing the nanoparticles size, heat transfer rate in term of the average Nusselt number increases. However, moderate Ri can be sorted into a second ranked where the role of the viscosity enhancement becomes more or less visible within the domain. It can be seen from Table 8 that, at this range of the Ri, addition of the nanoparticles into the based fluid slows down the nanofluid circulation and leads to an acceleration of onset of the natural convection. In fact, a weakening of the vortexes (a decrease in |ψmax|) caused by degradation of the mixed convection heat transfer ultimately leads to the existence of φopt where heat transfer rate reaches its peak value. In fact, it can be interpreted that, φopt refers to the situation in which two opposite factors of knf/kfand μnf/μf nullify the effects of each other. It should be noted that, since at moderate Ri, strength of the fluid flow is sufficiently high, by increasing the nanoparticles diameter φopt decreases due to reduction in thermal conductivity ratio. As the Ri increases, the negative effect of viscosity enhancement intensifies and overcome the prevailing effects of thermal conductivity augmentation. As a consequence of this fact and weak convection flow within the enclosure, φopt increases by augmenting nanoparticles diameter. The only exception to these findings takes place in case 2D where, like the lower values of Ri, optimal particles loading is equal to φmax. The reason for this special behavior can be traced in previous section. As mention earlier, in the purely conduction dominant regime, increment of the viscosity enhancement doesn't change the mechanism of heat transfer, and therefore thermal conductivity enhancement is the only deciding factor in heat transfer rate so that [Math Processing Error] increases incessantly as the nanoparticles volume fraction enhances. This trend is well corresponded to case 2D. More precisely, although in all cases 2A to 2D at Ri = 100 natural convection is dominant and strength of the flow is weak, but by locating high number of the conductive obstacles inside the enclosure, this mechanism of the heat transfer will be turned into the conduction mode, thus such behavior can be justifiable in this regime (to further confirm this observation compare |ψmax|in Table 8 between case 2A and 2D at Ri = 100 where presence of high number of solid obstacles slows down the nanofluid motion within the enclosure). Form the above explanation and existing results, it can be deduced that by increasing the Ri, φopt decreases. It is interesting to underline that, depending on the intensity of the fluid flow, geometry and boundary condition of the problem, this reduction can be trivial or very impressive. For example, it can be seen from Fig. 18 that, variations of φopt in case 2A between Ri = 10 and 100 is small while in cases 2B and 2C, φopt decreases considerably as the Ri enhances.
Fig. 19, Fig. 20 illustrate quantitative evaluation of nanoparticles distribution at different Ri and nanoparticles size for cases 2A, 2B and 2D. In general view, it is evident from Fig. 19 that for ultrafine particles (dp = 20 nm) there is no significant alteration in nanoparticle concentration with respect to its initial condition and particles typically follow the structures of the streamlines. For this size of the solid particles, by increasing the Ri or inserting some obstacles inside the enclosure, distribution of solid particles remains almost uniform which implies that numerical simulations can be accomplished using homogeneous model. As the nanoparticles mean diameter increases, the effects of the gravity, drag and centrifugal forces become more important such that non-uniformity in particles concentration starts to appear within the enclosure. In contrast to, the previous section that partitioning had a minor impact on the nanoparticles distribution it is apparent from Fig. 20 that by locating the obstacle inside the enclosure the degree of non-uniformity increases and this heterogeneity is elevated by fragmentation of the solid obstacle. In fact, due to the hydrodynamic blockage effects of solid blocks, the fluid movement is restrained so that working fluid cannot carry the solid particles, resulting in substantial increment of relative velocity between two phases. As the relative velocity increases, centrifugal force gives particles a chance to escape from the primary circulation cells and sediment on the rigid walls. It is noteworthy that, during the deposition process of solid particles, gravity as another main driving force determines the location of the sedimentation. It is evident from Fig. 19, Fig. 20 that, due to the gravity force, solid particles are accumulated on the bottom of the enclosure such that concentration of them at the top wall is considerably lower than the bottom wall especially for nanoparticle with diameter of 200 nm. This phenomenon also occurs for conductive obstacles, as it can be seen that the nanoparticles volume fraction on top of the blocks are noticeably higher than the bottom one. Another interesting feature is that, in all cases at moderate and high values of Ri, concentration of nanoparticles in the left half of the enclosure is higher than the right one. More precisely, as mentioned before, particles were initially dispersed evenly throughout the enclosure, as a result when the primary flow starts to circulate within the enclosure, particles at the vicinity of the bottom wall deposit quickly on the bottom wall while particles adjacent to the top wall follow CW vortex and descend. Since in the right half of the enclosure, streamline and gravity have the same direction (superposition of the gravity and buoyancy forces), particles are likely to reach the bottom wall and some of them are re-deposited on the lower wall. However, the rest of them move horizontally until they enter the left half of the enclosure. Since in that area, direction of the streamlines is opposite of the gravity force and flow intensity is not strong enough to capture the solid particles, stagnation point takes place so that velocity of the solid particles decreases. Meanwhile, due to existence of CCW eddy that was generated by shear force, particles are pulled towards that region, resulting in high and low concentration of solid particles in left and right halves of the enclosure, respectively. This observation is similar to that made by Mirmasoumi et al. [64,65] and Shariat et al. [68,69] who investigated the effects of nanoparticles size on the heat transfer rate of nanofluids using Manninen's two phase model [61]. Finally, similar to previous section, because of the point symmetry in the geometry of the problem, flow field, temperature pattern and nanoparticle concentration are symmetrical with respect to center of the enclosure which can be classified as another validation from mass, momentum and energy conservation point of the view in this part of the study.
5. Conclusions
In the current work, two new empirical equations for calculating the effective dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids are presented based on a high number of experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, five new equations are also proposed for calculating the viscosity of five common working fluids such as: Water, Glycerol, Ethylene glycol (EG), Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethanol. Besides, in order to further evaluate the performance of these two new equations, the proposed models are also applied to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of nanofluid in two well-known benchmark cases using two different methods of two phase flow namely: Buongiorno and Manninen's models. The principal outcomes emerging from the current work can be summarized as follows:
•
It is found that, at the same diameter and volume fraction of the solid particles, variation of the viscosity enhancement is significantly larger than that of the thermal conductivity ratio.
•
It is found that, the effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid (knf/kf), enhances by the increment of volume fraction (φ) and temperature (T) while a reverse trend can be observed as the solid particles diameter (dp) increases.
•
It is found that, type of the based fluid has a minor impact on both thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancement ratio.
•
The results show that, effective viscosity of the nanofluid (μnf/μf) presented in this work is independent of the solid particles type. As a result, this model can be widely used for any combination of the nanofluid without limitation.
•
The results show that, there are conflicting results among the recently conducted models for effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids while two new proposed models demonstrate excellent agreement with the experimental data.
•
The results obtained show that, values of relative thermal conductivity predicted by Patel et al. and Xuan et al. are much higher than the experimental data for the nanoparticles with the diameter smaller than 33 nm whereas Prasher and Chon's models tend to overestimate the actual thermal conductivity values.
•
It is found that, Koo's model demonstrates awkward behavior such that for solid concentration beyond the φ >  % 4, a sharp drop occurs in the values of thermal conductivity ratio.
•
The Maxwell and Brinkman models underestimate the effective thermal conductivities and viscosity of the nanofluids while they are fully consistent with the present models for micro-sized particles (dp = 5μm).
•
It is found that, Buongiorno's model is suitable for investigation the effects of the nanoparticles type while Manninen's model is designed to study the effects of the nanoparticles size on the heat transfer rate of solid-liquid two phase flow.
•
The obtained results have shown that, by decreasing the thermal conductivity and increasing the diameter of solid particles, the level of the heterogeneity enhances in the nanoparticles distribution.
•
It is found that, partitioning the enclosure has a minor impact on the nanoparticles distribution whereas by locating the obstacle inside the enclosure the degree of non-uniformity increases.
•
It is found that, at all values of Ra, by increasing the thermal conductivity of nanoparticles heat transfer rate and optimal particle loading increases.
•
It is found that, at low values of Ri, by decreasing the nanoparticles size, heat transfer rate and optimal particle loading increases while this trend cannot be extended to high values of Ri.
•
It is found that, partitioning the enclosure can significantly affect the heat transfer performance of the system while the effects of the inclusion of the conductive obstacles on the heat transfer rate are strongly depended on the flow intensity and regime of the fluid flow.
•
It is found that, any variation in flow intensity and regime of the flow can significantly affect the values of optimal particle loading especially at moderate Ra or Ri.
