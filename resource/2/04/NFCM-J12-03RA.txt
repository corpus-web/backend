Highlights
•We have measured iodine volatility from irradiated aqueous I− solutions.
•I− concentration has little effect over 5 orders of magnitude.
•The volatility cannot all be accounted for by molecular iodine (I2) formation.
•The results suggest that atomic iodine, I.•, is an important volatile species
Abstract
Measurements of the volatility of iodine from irradiated iodide (I−) solutions at concentrations down to 10−9 M are reported and compared with earlier data at higher I− concentrations (10−5 – 10−4 M). There is a significant pH effect on the volatility, as observed in other studies; the effects of concentration and temperature are less important. The measured volatilities cannot be wholly accounted for by I2, because its extensive hydrolysis at low [I−] would imply unrealistically high HOI concentrations. The partition coefficient of hypoiodous acid (HOI) is uncertain, but the reported values suggest it is too high to give the measured volatilities. It is therefore concluded that atomic iodine (I•) is an important contributor to iodine volatility under these low-concentration conditions.

1. Introduction
The radiation chemistry of iodine has been studied for several decades, initially as part of fundamental studies on the radiolysis of water and halogens (Buxton and Dainton, 1965) (Mulazzani and Buxton, 2006) (Buxton and Mulazzani, 2007). Iodine is of particular interest in nuclear reactor safety studies because of its combination of high fission yield, volatility, and radiological impact due to retention in the thyroid (Williams et al., 1993). There are more than 30 radioactive isotopes of iodine, most of which have very short half-lives (less than a few seconds); the isotope of most concern is 131I which has a half-life of ~8 days.
It has long been appreciated that radiolytic oxidation of aqueous iodide (I−) to volatile molecular iodine (I2) could form a route for release of radioiodine in pressurised water reactor (PWR) faults involving loss of coolant to the reactor containment. This has led to numerous small- and large-scale experimental programs and a series of specialist conferences on iodine in reactor safety (Deane and Potter, 1986) (Vikis, 1989) (Ishhigure et al., 1991) (Güntay, 1996) (CSNI, 1999) (CSNI, 2016). These studies have generally focussed on conditions relevant to uranium-fuelled light water reactors. However, the fission yields of 131I from 232Th and 239Pu are comparable to those from 235U (Nichols et al., 2008) so similar concerns around 131I releases would apply to other reactor types and nuclear facilities, although the chemistry associated with the release pathways may be very different.
The radiation chemistry of a solute in dilute solution initially involves the interaction of radiation with the solvent, producing a number of species which can react with each other or with other species in the solution; in the current study these include I−, other transient or stable iodine species, and dissolved oxygen. Irradiation of water by low linear energy transfer radiation results in the formation of hydrated electrons (e-aq), hydroxyl radicals (OH•), atomic and molecular hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide and H+ ions. The first step in the radiolytic oxidation of I− is oxidation by the hydroxyl radical, forming atomic iodine (I•)1, 2(Buxton et al., 1988):

I• reacts to form I2, either directly (Ishigure et al., 1988):

or via intermediate species, for example (Buechler and Buehler, 1976, Schwarz and Bielski, 1986, Turner et al., 1972):

I2 can undergo various reactions with water radiolysis products, converting it to higher (e.g. HOI, IO3−) or lower (I−) oxidation states. There are numerous possible reactions, as shown for example by (Evans, 1996), and the balance of these determines the concentration of I2 under a given set of solution conditions.
Most experimental work has been carried out at relatively high concentrations of I− (≥10−5 mol dm−3), which could be attained in accidents where extensive overheating of the core leads to the release of a large fraction of the iodine inventory from the fuel. However, there are several important nuclear reactor faults which involve lower I− concentrations, which have been less extensively studied not least because of analytical difficulties in measuring low concentrations of the volatile species. (Evans, 1996) measured iodine volatility above irradiated I−solutions at concentrations down to 10−8 mol dm−3. (Lin, 1980) used solvent extraction to determine speciation in irradiated carrier free (≤10−11 mol dm−3) 131I solutions.
Although the fundamental radiation chemistry remains the same, the dominant processes determining the iodine volatility may differ at low concentration. In particular, hydrolysis of I2 to hypoiodous acid (HOI):
@(6)
is favoured in more dilute solutions. HOI also exists as a gaseous species but it is less volatile than I2, so other volatile forms of iodine may be more important even if they are present in very low concentrations.
This paper describes experiments carried out at I− concentrations from 10−6 – 10−9 mol dm−3 to investigate these effects, and discusses some of the mechanisms which determine iodine volatility in these conditions.
2. Experimental
The iodine solutions employed in this work were radioactive. Handling was performed in dedicated radiological facilities using well-established radiological safety protocols. Sample solutions were prepared by dilution of appropriate quantities of caesium iodide in either boric acid solution (pH 4.6) or a solution of boric acid, sodium di-hydrogen phosphate, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (pH > 4.6), using high purity water (Millipore milli-RO/milli-Q). All reagents were Analar (99.99%) grade. To achieve solution pH values of greater than 7, a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide was added to the boric acid/phosphate solution. The concentrations used were caesium iodide (10−6, 10−7 and 10−9 mol dm−3), boric acid (0.2 mol dm−3) and phosphate (0.1 mol dm−3). The pH of solutions investigated were 4.6–4.8, 7 and 9, and temperatures were 22 and 80 °C. 30 cm3 aliquots of the solutions were spiked with 0.1 cm3 of reducing agent-free, carrier-free 131I, in the form of sodium iodide (purchased from Amersham International) dissolved in sodium hydroxide (10−4 mol dm−3), to give a solution activity of 1–5 kBq cm−3. No additional purification of the 131I was done because the amount and dilution used was such that any impurities would have been insignificant compared with the other reagents. 10 cm3 of this labelled solution (A) was weighed into a vial for counting and 20 cm3 weighed into the irradiation vessel.
NaI scintillation detectors were used to measure 131I. These were calibrated by measuring 131I using intrinsic germanium detectors whose efficiency was calibrated using traceable standards. However, measurements of transfer were made using relative methods whereby solutions were counted before and after irradiation so fractional transfer was a relative measurement and did not rely on standards.
The apparatus used for this work was as described previously (Ashmore et al., 2000) and is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The gamma irradiation facility was a one-off design built for UKAEA in the 1960's. The source consisted of a set of 60Co pencils, each sheathed in stainless steel, held in an annular arrangement inside a shielded flask. The source could be moved over, and lowered into, a shielded cavity containing the test vessel so that the solution was surrounded by the 60Co pencils. The shielded cavity had a crescent-shaped hole through which a curved glass tube was threaded allowing transfer of gas in and out of the sample. The sample solutions were irradiated at a dose-rate of 0.69 kGy h−1, as measured by the Fricke method (Fricke and Hart, 1966).3 The sample vessel and all the flow lines were made of glass.
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the sparging apparatus.
The sample solution was sparged with air, drawn through the circuit by a pump to ensure gas flowing through the apparatus was at a reduced pressure, so any leakage would be inwards into the circuit containing 131I. The air initially passed through a flow-meter, a charcoal trap to remove organics, an alkaline CO2 trap and finally a water trap to humidify the gas. The air was then drawn through the irradiation vessel and into an iodine trap containing 50 cm3 sodium hydroxide (2.5 × 10−2 mol dm−3) and sodium iodide (2 × 10−3 mol dm−3) solution. The liquid trap was found to give more reliable counting results than charcoal, presumably because of the more homogenous geometry. On exiting the first trap the gas passed through a backup (activated charcoal) trap and a silica gel trap to dry it before measurement of the outlet flow rate. The system was tested by sparging I2 solutions spiked with 131I, which showed quantitative transfer of activity to the trap at the expected rate. Two blank tests were done without irradiation to determine the “background” transfer rate.
The temperature of the irradiation vessel and the temperature within the detector shielding were recorded during each run. It was observed that there was an effect of temperature on detector efficiency, which tended to fall with decreasing temperature and led to an apparent change in the rate of iodine transfer. At elevated temperatures, a Kaptan covered heating element was wrapped round the irradiation vessel. The pre-humidifier, just before the irradiation vessel in the gas line, was heated to the same temperature to minimise loss of water from the test solution.
The experiments were generally of long duration, lasting for up to 120 h for the higher-pH solutions; counts were recorded every 5 min and the data were corrected for decay during the test. At the end of each experiment, solution A was re-counted together with the activities remaining in the irradiated solution, collected in the NaOH/I− and activated charcoal traps and washed from the delivery lines (with 10% HCl) to allow the activity balance to be calculated. The counting uncertainty was judged to be less than 10%, though losses in the flow line and the temperature effects mentioned above led to higher uncertainties in the on-line counting, particularly for the tests at higher pH where the transfer rate was slower.
3. Results
Typical experimental data are shown in Fig. 2. The graphs show the fraction of the 131I activity initially present in the solution that has been transferred to the trap as a function of the dose. Some results from the earlier study (Ashmore et al., 2000) at higher concentration are included for comparison (10−4 and 10−5 mol dm−3, shown as yellow and grey lines), though these were at a higher dose rate (~1.5 kGy h−1).

Though there is considerable scatter in the data, it is clear that pH has the largest effect on volatility, with much higher transfer rates being measured at pH 5 (Fig. 2(a) and (c) than pH 7 (Fig. 2(b) and (d). Temperature appears to have little effect, particularly at pH 4.6, though there is a small decrease in volatility at higher temperature at pH 7. The I− concentration also appears to have a small effect, though at pH 4.6 the volatility is higher at the high concentrations (10−5-10−4 mol dm−3) used in the previous study. A similar but weaker effect is observed at pH 7.
The rate of transfer of iodine to the trap is related to its volatility by:
@(7)
Where F is the fraction transferred, Q is the gas flow rate, Vw is the volume of the solutions and [Itotal](g) and [Itotal](aq) are the total volumetric concentrations of iodine in the gaseous and solution phases respectively. If there is a single volatile iodine species (e.g. I2) in equilibrium between the gas and solution, Equation (7) can be written as
@(8)
where [Ivol](aq) is the concentration of the volatile species and R is its partition coefficient:
@(9)
The fraction of iodine in the volatile form in solution is therefore given by:
@(10)
However, if the identity of the volatile species is uncertain, the volatility can be quantified more generally by the iodine partition coefficient (IPC):
@(11)
Which is obtained by rearranging Equation (7):
@(12)
The results of the experiments are summarised in Table 1. The on-line counting results were used for the calculations in low pH runs where transfer was fast, and the maximum transfer rate was used to calculate the minimum IPC in each case. At high pH, where the uncertainties were higher, the final activity measured off-line was used to determine the average rate of transfer to the trap.

* Unirradiated blank test.
The fvol(I2) values shown in the table were calculated from Equation (10) assuming that the volatile species was I2, with a partition coefficient (R) of 82 and 11 at 25 and 80 °C respectively.
The calculated IPC values are plotted in Fig. 3. Selected values from the previous study (Ashmore et al., 2000) are included for comparison, together with additional data (pH 7 without irradiation, and pH 9) not shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 3. Summary of IPC results.
Fig. 3 more clearly shows the trends discussed above regarding the effects of pH, temperature and I− concentration. Again, the results for 10−4 and 10−5 mol dm−3 solutions are from (Ashmore et al., 2000); these are circled as the dose rates were different in these earlier tests. As expected, in the absence of irradiation the IPC values at pH 7 are much higher, as a small amount of iodine is transported to the trap probably by droplet carryover. Similar values are measured in the irradiated tests at pH 9, suggesting that radiolytically-induced volatility was undetectable at this pH.
The only apparent effect of concentration is at pH ~5, where the tests at higher concentrations gave lower IPC values. However, as noted above these experiments were performed at different dose rates (0.25 and 1.55 kGy h−1) which would influence the results. The more recent tests used a dose rate of about 0.7 kGy h−1, so if there were no concentration effect these results should be bounded by the earlier IPC values, which is not entirely the case; however, the scatter in the data make it difficult to draw a firm conclusion.
The results in Fig. 3 are broadly consistent with those obtained under similar conditions by (Evans, 1996), who measured IPCs in the range ~3 × 104 – 5 × 105 at room temperature and pH 7 with little effect of concentration. Evans' IPCs in 10−8 mol dm−3 I− at pH 5 were higher than those shown above (~105), resulting in a smaller pH effect on the volatility between pH 5 and 7 in very dilute solution. (Lin, 1980) measured I2 fractions in the range 0.4–2.2% in irradiated carrier-free 131I solutions at pH 7, an order of magnitude higher than the fvol(I2) values in 10−9 mol dm−3 solutions (Table 1). The maximum dose used in these tests was 45 kGy, comparable to the current work, and the I2 yield appeared to decrease with increasing dose. Lin's results showed that at low concentration and pH < 9, the involatile iodine was predominantly iodate (IO3−) rather than I−.
4. Discussion
Although the chemistry in irradiated iodine solutions is complex, as discussed above, quantitatively the results can largely be explained by reference to the hydrolysis of I2 (Reaction 6). The equilibrium constant of this reaction is strongly temperature dependent (Burns et al., 1990), decreasing the equilibrium concentration of I2 with increasing temperature. However, this is offset by the increase in I2 volatility with increasing temperature, so the IPC is largely independent of temperature as shown in Fig. 3.
Reaction 6 also shows that the I2 concentration should be pH dependent, reducing the volatility at high pH as observed in Fig. 3. There are other important reactions that contribute to the effect of pH, notably with H2O2, and this has been discussed in detail by (Ashmore et al., 2000).
Another implication of Reaction 6 is that the hydrolysis of I2 is increased at lower I− concentrations, as the ratio of I2 to HOI concentrations is:
@(13)
where K6 is the hydrolysis equilibrium constant (Reaction 6). If the overall extent of radiolytic oxidation is independent of concentration, therefore, the fraction of oxidised iodine present at I2 should decrease at lower concentrations because it is hydrolysed to HOI. This does not appear to be reflected in the results discussed above.
If all the volatile iodine is assumed to be I2, the concentrations of I2, I− and HOI in the aqueous phase can be calculated by solving equation (13) using the fvol values as calculated above and
@(14)
(Burns et al., 1990), which gives values of 3.28 × 10−13 and 4.24 × 10−11 at 22 and 80 °C respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 4, which shows the fraction of the total iodine in each form. The figure includes results from 10−4 and 10−5 mol dm−3 I− solutions (Ashmore et al., 2000) for comparison.

† Hydrolysis equilibrium not consistent with mass balance, concentrations not plausible
* Non-irradiated test.
At high initial I− concentrations (10−6 – 10−4 mol dm−3) the assumption that I2 is the only volatile species is supported, as the calculated concentrations of I2 and HOI appear reasonable and are a small fraction of the total iodine concentration. However, at lower [I−] this is no longer the case. At 10−7 mol dm−3 I− the calculated concentrations are plausible, though [HOI] is higher than [I2] in most cases. At 10−9 mol dm−3 I−, Equation (13) could not be solved whilst respecting the iodine mass balance. For these cases (marked † in Fig. 4) a simpler calculation was applied in which it was assumed that [I−] did not change from the initial value; the HOI fraction was calculated to be close to, or even higher than, 1 which is clearly impossible. This suggests that at low [I−] there is another significant volatile iodine species that is not accounted for in this analysis.
One possible explanation is that HOI is the dominant volatile iodine species at low concentrations. The volatile fraction in this case would be related to the values in Table 1 by a modified Equation (10):
@(15)
The partition coefficient for HOI is uncertain; from the determination of (Lin, 1981) it is about 4000 at 25 °C, but (Evans and Jervis, 1992) estimated a minimum value of 30000, about 400 times higher than I2. Taking the latter value, in Run 1 (−9/22/4.9) the volatile fraction of 0.025 (as I2) would increase to about 10 (as HOI), which is clearly not possible. The other tests for which there was no solution to Equation (13) that respected the iodine mass balance would give volatile fractions that were below 1 but still unexpectedly high, for example ~20% in Run 12 (−9/22/7).
These observations support the hypothesis that I• is an important volatile species under conditions where I2 formation is not favourable (high pH, high temperature, low [I−]). I• is an intermediate species in the oxidation of I− which rapidly reacts to form I2− and ultimately I2 (Equations (2), (3), (4), (5))) among other reactions, but as the total iodine concentration decreases these reactions will become less important. The concentration of I• in solution could therefore increase up to the point where its contribution to the volatility equals or exceeds that of I2, particularly if its partition coefficient is lower. Modelling studies of iodine volatility from irradiated solutions have shown improved agreement with experimental data when atomic I• was considered as a volatile species (Evans, 1996), (Dickinson and Sims, 2000).
A partition coefficient for I• of 1.9 at 25 °C has previously been calculated based on a  value for I•(aq) of 76.5 kJ mol−1 (Ashmore et al., 2000). A more recent evaluation recommends a value of 78.8 ± 2 kJ mol−1 (Armstrong et al., 2015) which, with  (I•(g)) = 70.2 kJ mol−1 (Chase, 1998), gives a partition coefficient of 0.75, about 100 times lower than that of I2. The uncertainty in the Gibbs energy equates to a factor of 2.2 on the partition coefficient. The partition coefficient of Xe is 0.14 at 25 °C and shows a similar temperature dependence to that of I2 so it is reasonable to assume that the partition coefficient of I• is close to RI2/100 at all temperatures.
From the data in Table 1, the volatile iodine fractions (calculated as I2) in the solutions with ≤10−6 mol dm−3 I− at 22 °C were around 2 × 10−2 at pH ~4.6 and 5 × 10−4 at pH 7; at 80 °C the fractions were an order of magnitude lower. If the volatile species was I• the fractions would be 100× lower, so the absolute I• concentrations would be in the range 10−16 to 10−10 mol dm−3 which is not unreasonable for a radical intermediate.
The INSPECT computer model (Dickinson and Sims, 2000) showed good agreement with experimental results at high I− concentrations (10−5 and 10−4 mol dm−3). However, preliminary calculations with this model greatly over-predicted the volatility in the tests described here, suggesting that I• was formed too quickly, or not removed quickly enough, at low I− concentrations. Reactions of I• with HO2− and O2− (16), (17), (18) were added to the model to decrease the calculated volatility at low concentrations.4
@(16)
@(17)
@(18)
No rate constants were found in the literature for these reactions. Reaction 16 is thermodynamically very favourable ( = −56 kJ mol−1, from data in (Armstrong et al., 2015) and (Wagman et al., 1982)) so it is likely that this is a fast reaction. Reactions 17 and 18 are analogous to fast reactions reducing I2 to I2−; again they are very thermodynamically favourable ( = −148 and −121 kJ mol−1 respectively, from the same data sources) so are likely to be fast. The rate constants cited by (Cripps et al., 2011) for Reactions 17 and 18 were estimated by analogy with the I2 reactions which are assumed to be diffusion controlled.
Although these reactions decreased the calculated volatility at low concentrations, it was still overestimated by more than a factor of 10 at pH 7. This suggests that there are other reactions either involving I• production or removal which are not considered here. One possibility is an impurity which reacts with OH. in competition with I−; alternatively, there may be other removal reactions for I•. For example, there is reported to be a fast reaction with NO2− (Barkatt and Ottolenghi, 1974):
@(19)
In these solutions NO2− may be formed by radiolysis of the sparge gas, and nitrite and nitrate would be expected to accumulate in the irradiated solution during the long irradiation time.
The potential effect of impurities is a major uncertainty in this work. The main source of impurities is likely to be the buffer chemicals; at the relatively high concentrations used, trace impurity concentrations could be orders of magnitude higher than that of the iodine species and these effects probably also contributed to the scatter in the data. However, impurity effects are likely to be much larger in reactor containment water where a range of other materials could also be present.
Another uncertainty is the effect of reactions in the gas space above the irradiated solution. The residence time of the sparge gas in the vessel was around 1 min, and I•(g) would react rapidly with other radicals or species formed by the irradiation of water-saturated air. A likely initial product is IO•(g) formed by reactions such as:
@(20)
but the extent to which IO• would remain in the gas flow rather than depositing on the lines or re-dissolving in the solution is difficult to estimate. Such reactions are also important in the marine boundary layer where volatilised iodine may ultimately be involved in ozone depletion (Carpenter, 2003).
5. Conclusions
The radiolytic oxidation of I− in very dilute solutions has been measured as a function of pH and temperature. The data show that, similar to higher concentrations, increasing the pH significant decreases the release of volatile iodine from irradiated solution. Although hydrolysis of I2 would be favoured at these very low concentrations, in high pH conditions volatilisation is still significant largely because of the iodine atom. Increasing the temperature to 80 °C has no significant effect on the volatility because of the opposing effects of temperature on the formation of volatile iodine in solution and its partition into the gas phase. Kinetic modelling overestimates the volatility in these experiments, suggesting that some key reactions are still not identified.
A major uncertainty in this work is the effect of impurities, which probably also contributed to the scatter in the data. Radiolysis in the gas phase is also important as it might be expected to suppress volatility by forming less-volatile forms of iodine.
The chemistry in these solutions is complex, but nevertheless the data are important for use in assessing reactor faults involving low concentrations of iodine. Whilst unknown impurities and gas-phase reactions are a likely source of uncertainty in these tests, their effect is likely to be much smaller than would be expected in a reactor containment.
