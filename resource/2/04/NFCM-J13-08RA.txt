Abstract
A probabilistic heat transfer model was developed that allows for the gradual evolution of bed-to-surface heat transfer coefficients with increasing superficial gas velocity when bubbling and turbulent flow structures co-exist. The model is based on the packet renewal theory and the probability of particle packets for the specific hydrodynamic regime adjacent to the heat transfer surface. Assuming distinctive two-phase flow, dense packets at minimum fluidization voidage and voids almost free of particles, causes the heat transfer coefficients to be underestimated in the turbulent flow regime. By allowing for contributions of structures of intermediate voidage that reflect typical behavior in the turbulent flow regime of fluidization, heat transfer predictions are improved significantly. The resulting model is shown to give good agreement with experimental heat transfer data for fluidized beds of FCC and Alumina particles, changing smoothly from one flow regime to another in columns of different diameters and from the core of the bed to the wall.

1. Introduction
Fluidized bed reactors are often used when large amounts of heat need to be supplied or removed, or when the temperature needs to be closely controlled. The heat transfer rates are improved when the fluidized bed reactor is operated at conditions near the transition to turbulent fluidization [1]. Although heat transfer in fluidized beds has been investigated extensively resulting in many empirical and semi-empirical correlations, since heat transfer is affected by many factors, the applicability of the correlations tends to be confined to limited ranges of conditions. Despite the importance of the turbulent flow regime for commercial fluidized bed reactors, models that give reliable predictions for a wide range of operating conditions, covering the transition from one fluidization flow regime to another are not available.
Of the reviews on heat transfer, few [[2], [3], [4], [5]] mention the turbulent flow regime. Aside from the work of [[6], [7], [8], [9]], very few correlations were also found in the literature explicitly intended for turbulent beds. The mechanisms of heat transfer are now well known. However, many heat transfer studies implementing a mechanistic model concluded that a better knowledge of the flow structures and their properties is needed (e.g. [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]).
The most flexible model relating heat transfer to hydrodynamics is the packet renewal model by Mickley and Fairbanks [15]. They proposed the following relationship for the instantaneous heat transfer coefficient:
(1)[Math Processing Error]
This model assumes that particle packets arrive at the surface where they transfer heat by conduction in a transient manner before being replaced by other particle packets. The heat transfer is then dependent on the thermal conductivity of the packet (keff), its volumetric heat capacity (cppρp(1-εpa)), and the time (τ) spent at the surface before being replaced. For a bubbling bed, the packet is usually assumed to be at minimum fluidization conditions, i.e. εpa = εmf. The time-average heat transfer coefficient of the packet can then be obtained by integration of the above equation.
To be able to apply this model, hydrodynamic parameters such as the fraction of time that the heat transfer surface is in contact with particle packets and their average time spent at the heating surface are needed.
In this study, a probability packet renewal model is proposed, intended to cover bed-to-immersed surface heat transfer in bubbling and turbulent fluidization by capturing the gradual changes and the coexistence of flow structures typical of the flow regimes considered. Probabilistic modelling has previously been shown (e.g. [16]) to provide a useful model for bridging successive flow regimes in fluidized bed reactors.
2. Probability packet renewal model for turbulent beds
To model heat transfer in turbulent fluidized beds based on the packet renewal concept requires identification of the characteristic flow structures, their frequency of arrival at the heat transfer surface, and their durations there. A number of research groups (e.g. [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]) have reported measurements of these quantities, mostly for bubbling beds, and in some cases extending into the turbulent and fast fluidization flow regimes.
Bubbling fluidized beds are commonly represented by two-phase models, considering the bed to be composed of a dense phase of voidage equal to εmf and voids (bubbles) of voidage close to 1. In the fast fluidization flow regime, the bed is commonly considered to be composed of clusters or streamers, mostly descending along the wall of a riser and a high-voidage phase, mostly in the interior of the riser.
Turbulent fluidized beds are intermediate in their behaviour and structures between bubbling and fast fluidized beds. Previous researchers have commonly imposed two-phase models on turbulent beds, extending the framework of bubbling beds and even characterizing the structure in terms of bubbles and dense phase. However, voids in turbulent fluidization are transitory in nature, distorted in shape and varying in their void fractions. Rather than the nearly bimodal frequency distributions of void fraction that are often assumed to apply for the neighbouring bubbling and fast fluidization flow regimes, turbulent fluidization is subject to much broader probability voidage distributions.
To allow for the gradual transition and co-existence of flow structures typical for turbulent beds, a probability model based on the packet renewal heat transfer theory is proposed. As a compromise between simplicity and accuracy, we consider turbulent structures to be composed of three types:
(1)dense phase structures with voidage close to εmf,
(2)structures of intermediate voidage εint = 0.5(εmin + εmax), and.
(3)transient voids of voidage εv.
Fig. 1 shows a photograph taken at the transparent column wall, when the bed was operated in turbulent fluidization, illustrating the flow structure described above. The dashed oval marks a region of slowly moving particles, a structure that is common for bubbling fluidized bed at the column wall, identified as dense phase. Transient voids are marked by white arrows, while the direction of fast particle streams, defined in our model as structures of intermediate voidage, are denoted by black arrows.

3. Hydrodynamic parameters needed for the packet renewal model
Experiments were conducted in cylindrical columns of 0.29 and 1.56 m inner diameter with FCC and alumina particles. An electrically heated vertical tube which could be traversed radially was designed to measure heat transfer coefficients. The local voidage was measured by optical probes placed above and below the heating surface. Insight on the local hydrodynamics and heat transfer coefficients at the 0.29 m column was obtained from a transparent heat transfer probe mounted on the wall. In addition, pressure transducers were installed along the column to evaluate the flow regime transition from the pressure fluctuations. Ranges of operating parameters are provided in Table 1 and the properties of the particulate material are given in Table 2. For more details of the experiments, see [[30], [31], [32]].

Fluctuations and the frequency distribution of instantaneous local particle concentrations (or voidage) near the heat transfer surface have been used by [18,[24], [25], [26]] to identify flow structures required for the packet renewal model. Because the distribution of the local voidage around the peak near εmf (Fig. 2) can be assumed to be Gaussian. Lin et al. [34] used a threshold of 95% confidence interval: ε = εmf + 1.96 σεmf. Bi and Cheng adopted the midpoint in the local voidage distribution, 0.5(εmin + εmax) to differentiate between dense and void phase. The effect of threshold voidage was reviewed by the same authors [35].
Fig. 2. Distribution of local voidage for U/Uc = 1.6 at r/R = 0 for: a) FCC b) alumina. Threshold voidages from different methods are indicated.
Probability distributions of local voidage measured at the centre of the 0.29 m diameter column operating well into the turbulent fluidization flow regime are plotted in Fig. 2. These show distinct peaks at low voidage (close to εmf), but broad distributions of local voidage extending all the way up to a voidage of 1. Clearly considering a single average voidage for the latter peaks is not appropriate.
Two thresholds were selected to capture the presence and renewal frequency of the typical flow structures in the proposed model:

These two voidage values are identified in Fig. 2 for experimental FCC and alumina voidage probability distributions at U/Uc = 1.6, as well as for time traces of local voidage for FCC particles in Fig. 3.

3.1. Probability of dense and intermediate structures
The probability of a flow structure with an average voidage εmf at the surface is assumed to be equal to the fraction of total time, δd, when the local voidage is less than or equal to εmf(1 + 2σ). The fraction of total time, δv, corresponding to voids of voidage greater than 0.5(εmin + εmax) estimates the probability of the dilute (void) phase. The fraction of time, δint, that a surface is exposed to structures of intermediate void fraction, εint, is then estimated as:

The dense phase fractions for alumina particles, at three radial positions, r/R = 0, 0.8 and 1, in the column of 0.29 m diameter, and one radial position, r/R = 0.6, in the 1.56 m diameter column are plotted in Fig. 4. The fraction of time the probe was in contact with the dense phase was, as expected, higher in the wall region than in the core. The column diameter did not significantly affect the dense phase fraction at radial locations with similar flow structure (r/R = 0 for Dt = 0.29 m, and r/R = 0.6 for Dt = 1.56 m where most of the voids occurred).

Fig. 5 presents the effect of particle properties and gas distributor at r/R = 0 in the 0.29 m column. The effect of the distributor on the dense phase fraction in the core region of the bed of FCC particles was insignificant. However, the dense phase fraction decreases less rapidly for the alumina particles than for the FCC particles, indicating more gradual disappearance of the dense phase. Results from Chandran and Chen [36] for 256 μm sand, and correlations from Cui et al. [19] are also plotted in Fig. 5 for comparison.

The probability of all three phases (dense, intermediate and void), based on the time fraction spent by each phase at the surface, is shown in Fig. 6 for four experimental conditions. The curves for the intermediate phase were obtained by least squares polynomial curve fitting of the experimental data to avoid scatter. The more gradual decrease of the dense phase fraction for alumina (Fig. 6a) than for FCC (Fig. 6d) at the axis supports the observations of a more gradual transition to turbulent fluidization for group B particles., which are likely to exhibit slugging in laboratory-scale units [37]. Moreover, the intermediate phase increases in importance more rapidly for FCC than for alumina particles, indicating increased turbulent flow structure in the FCC. Near the wall (Fig. 6b), the dense phase fraction remains the same over a wide range of superficial velocities in the turbulent regime.

3.2. Average particle packet contact time
Studies have shown that the frequency at which individual particle packets appear at the surface in bubbling and slugging fluidized beds corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of bubbles [23]. To identify the frequency of the packets appearing at the surface, which can be used to obtain the average contact time for the flow structures used in this model, the number of crossings was obtained at the two local voidage thresholds. A crossing frequency, f1, was obtained from the fluctuations of local voidage around a local voidage of εmf(1 + 2σ), whereas a second crossing frequency, f2, was obtained from the fluctuation around a local voidage of 0.5(εmin + εmax):

(9)@
Here, n1 and n2 are the numbers of times that the signal crosses the local voidage threshold at εmf(1 + 2σ) and at 0.5(εmin + εmax), respectively, in both directions (indicated by “o” and “x” in Fig. 3a and b, respectively), and ttotal is the total sampling time.
As Fig. 7 shows, the crossing frequencies, f1 and f2, are similar for low gas velocities, and both indicate renewal by bubbles. As turbulent flow structures increase in importance with increasing U, the frequencies from the two methods diverge. While f1 continues to detect packets from the dense phase (less frequent with increasing U), f2 detects both the dense packets and packets of intermediate voidage (the last more frequent with increasing U), and continues to increase.

The correlation for renewal frequency provided by Di Natale et al. [23],

shows good agreement with our experimental data in the bubbling regime. In addition, the crossing frequency obtained from the local voidage signal at low gas velocities is similar to the dominant frequency in the power spectrum of the differential pressure signal, fDP (square symbols in Fig. 7). Experimental data [37] for 57 μm FCC particles and [15] for 70 μm glass beads in bubbling beds are also plotted in Fig. 7 for comparison.
The crossing frequency, f1, for alumina particles at three radial positions closer to the column wall (r/R = 0.8, 0.9 and 1), is plotted against superficial gas velocity in Fig. 8. The trend is similar with the crossing frequency in the center of the column, increasing with increasing U in the bubbling bed and decreasing slightly in the turbulent bed as the dense packets become less frequent. At the wall, the onset of turbulent fluidization and intense mixing caused more frequent voids, thus increasing the crossing frequency with increasing U.

The average contact time of the dense flow structures with the surface, δd, was estimated from the time fraction the surface was exposed to dense phase packets, and the frequency at which the dense structures appeared at the surface, fd, was assumed to be identical to the crossing frequency, f1 (Eq. (8)) around the threshold εmf(1 + 2σ).

For the average contact time of the packets from the intermediate phase, frequency fint was obtained by subtracting n1 = number of times the signal crossed threshold εmf(1 + 2σ) from n2 = number of crossings of 0.5(εmin + εmax):

The average time the packets of intermediate voidage are present at the probe can then be estimated by:

The frequency of intermediate particle obtained from Eq. (12) is plotted in Fig. 8, which compares radial locations close to the column wall. The plotted frequency coincides with the crossing frequency obtained from an independent measurement of local voidage at the column wall (see [32]). This suggests that there is a relationship between the dominant mechanism of particle renewal in the core of the fluidized bed and at the wall.
The results for alumina particles at r/R = 0 and r/R = 0.8 in the 0.29 m column, and r/R = 0.6 in the 1.56 m column are shown in Fig. 9. Data from [18] for 256 μm sand particles, and correlations by [17,38] are also plotted in Fig. 9 for comparison. The average contact time of particles from the dense phase decreases steeply at low gas velocities and then levels off. This steep decrease results from the decrease of the fraction of time the dense phase is present and the increase in crossing frequency as more bubbles rise. As the turbulent fluidization regime was approached, the dense phase fraction continued to decrease, but dense packets became less frequent, causing the average particle contact time to remain almost constant. For alumina particles near the wall (r/R = 0.8) of the 0.29 m column, the average contact time began to increase slightly in the turbulent bed (Fig. 9) as a result of the decreasing frequency of dense packets while the time fraction of dense packets remained unchanged with increasing U. An increase in particle contact time was measured at the wall in the turbulent regime for sand particles by Hamidipour et al. [20,21] and modeled by Zarghami et al. [22]. They observed a minimum particle contact time at the onset of turbulent fluidization and explained it in terms of a change in flow structure. Whereas in bubbling beds, increasing U increases the bubble velocity causing particles to move faster at the wall and reducing the particle contact time, in turbulent beds, void velocity no longer increases with increasing U. In addition, the extra gas passes mostly through the core, while particles spend more time near the wall. Increasing particle contact time, after a shallow minimum extending over a range of U, was also found by Goosens [39] who estimated the particle contact time based on a boundary layer penetration model.

Fig. 10 shows that for FCC particles at r/R = 0, the average contact time of particles from the dense phase decreased gradually with increasing U for the range of velocities investigated. In the turbulent bed, the particle contact time was close to the contact time at the wall measured by Hamidipour et al. [20] using radioactive 420 and 500 μm tracer particles in a bed of FCC particles. The agreement with our data is favourable.

4. Implementation of the model to heat transfer coefficients
The estimated time-average heat transfer coefficient calculated from Eq. (3) is compared to the measured h in Fig. 11. The dense and intermediate phase fractions and contact times were determined experimentally. Least square curves are fitted through the experimental hydrodynamics data to avoid scatter. The solid line represents the total h calculated by Eq. (3), whereas the dashed and dotted lines represent the contributions from the dense and the intermediate phases, respectively. The effective thermal conductivities of the dense and intermediate packets were calculated from the equation of Kunii and Levenspiel, [5]:

using the corresponding average voidages of the packets, with these voidages assumed to be equal to εmf for the dense structures and εint = 0.5(εmin + εmax) for the intermediate structures. Particle properties are provided in Table 2.
Fig. 11. Comparison of heat transfer model predictions and experimental results.
a) – c) alumina; d) FCC (open diamonds: perforated plate; filled diamonds: bubble cap; circles: data from [40]).
For the experimental data at the bed axis in the smaller column, the model predictions are within ±7% and ± 12% for FCC and alumina particles, respectively (Figs. 11a and d). It is apparent that the heat transfer coefficients calculated considering only the dense phase contribution underestimated h at high gas velocities where turbulent flow structures are expected to be dominant and a significant fraction of particles are in the void phase. The error from excluding the intermediate phase contribution is seen in Fig. 11d to be greater for the FCC particles, which exhibit more typical turbulent flow structure over the range of velocities investigated than alumina particles. The transition to turbulent fluidization for alumina particles is of a different nature. The local flow structure varies intermittently between bubbling and turbulent-like flow structure in the range of velocities studied. The dense phase fraction decreases very gradually, on the one hand, and the increase in intermediate phase is slow, on the other hand. The trend of h vs. U for alumina particles is consistent with the gradual change in the flow structure. For alumina, the contribution of the intermediate phase appears to be slightly underestimated. This might be due to the threshold voidage adopted to evaluate the properties of the intermediate phase, leaving a significant number of particles in the dilute phase, whose contribution was neglected.
Note that the model requires knowledge of the contact times for dense and intermediate packets, as well as the probability for the respective packets to occupy the surface. These parameters were obtained empirically, from the measured instantaneous local voidage, limiting their applicability to conditions under which the experiments were carried out. The fluidized system configuration (e.g. size of the column or presence of internals) affects the development of flow structures typical for turbulent fluidization. The proposed model provides the flexibility to include these considerations in the probability of the intermediate phase.
The results of Beeby and Potter [40], who studied heat transfer from a horizontal tube bank in a bed of group A particles, are superimposed in Fig. 11d to compare a fluidized system where a turbulent flow structure was probably not developed. For fluidized systems that retain a relatively stable two-phase flow structure with increasing gas velocity (e.g. slugging), the heat transfer coefficient reachesa peak and started to decrease at lower superficial gas velocities. This trend is observed in [40], the heat transfer coefficients at lower superficial gas velocities are comparable with our experimental data and model prediction, but they start to decline after a maximum is reached around 340 W/m2K. The presence of a horizontal tube bank is shown to affect the bed hydrodynamics [41] and it is likely that the flow structures typical for turbulent fluidization were not developed but rather stabilized the two phase flow structure. The dense phase component of the modeled heat transfer coefficient (dashed line in Fig. 11d) captures the trend of the decreasing heat transfer coefficients at higher gas velocities, indicating that the probabilistic model can be applied to systems where turbulent flow structure is not developed, as long as this is captured in the probability. More research should be conducted to derive general correlations for the probability and the contact time for each phase.
5. Conclusion
The transition to the turbulent regime is gradual, with bubbling and turbulent flow structures co-existing in the range of superficial gas velocities. A probability model, incorporating the fractions of particle packets typical for the specific hydrodynamic regimes, provides a rational approach to account for the co-existence of different flow structures. This study indicates that it is helpful to incorporate turbulent bed hydrodynamics (based on fluctuations in the intermediate range of local voidages) in heat transfer models. Specific to this model is the contribution of an intermediate phase to the total heat transfer coefficient, representing the particle streamers or packets suspended in voids at higher U. Assuming only two phases (dense phase at εmf and void phase at εv = 1) in turbulent beds causes h to be underestimated.
The model was tested using experimental hydrodynamic data obtained at different radial position in columns of different diameters, and for group A and AB particle properties. The applicability of this model for improvement or design of new processes is limited by the lack of a general method to predict the required hydrodynamic parameters for the intermediate phase. This needs further development in the future.
