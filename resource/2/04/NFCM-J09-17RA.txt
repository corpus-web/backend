SUMMARY
The shielding analysis of the spent fuel dry storage cask TN-32 is carried out using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo neutron- and photon-transport code MCS developed by the Computational Reactor Physics and Experiment laboratory of the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology. The shielding analysis involves the transport simulation of the decay neutrons and gammas emitted by the spent fuel to obtain the neutron and gamma dose rate values outside of the cask. This deep-penetration problem is solved by means of weight window population control as variance reduction. The TN-32 cask calculations are repeated with the MCNP6 Monte Carlo code for verification purpose and a good agreement within three standard deviations is observed between MCS and MCNP6. The neutron dose rate on the cask surface and 2 m away from the cask can be calculated with MCS, whereas the photon dose rate calculation for positions outside of the cask will be further improved by employing more sophisticated variance reduction techniques.
1 INTRODUCTION
South Korea is the world's fifth largest user of nuclear power for electricity production.1 In 2018, it produced about 150 TWh electricity from nuclear reactors, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's electricity production that year.2 However, as a deep geological disposal facility for high-level waste has not been constructed in South Korea, discharged fuels from the refueling activities are still being stored at the reactor sites, mostly in the reactor cooling pools.3 Annually, around 750 tons of spent fuel is generated by South Korean nuclear plants.4 With the current buildup rate of spent fuels, four reactor sites are expected to reach saturation as soon as 2021.5 In addition, the Kori Unit 1 nuclear power plant has been shut down since June 2017 for decommissioning, thus making the spent fuel management issue in South Korea even more significant as the spent fuel still located inside the Kori 1 cooling pool must be transported out of the site to enable the decommission process. Dry-storage strategy with the use of spent fuel casks is the main solution envisioned in South Korea to deal with the interim storage of spent fuels.6 Due to the highly radioactive nature of the spent fuel, management of spent fuel in storage casks is vital and must be stringent to ensure radiological and environmental safety.7, 8
As a part of management requirements, criticality and shielding analysis of spent fuel casks are conducted in advance to minimize the criticality and radiation hazard to the public and personnel during the actual handling and transportation of the spent fuel. Computer codes are preferred for such analysis since multiple calculations are performed to optimize the loading of spent fuel assemblies and ensure shielding criteria. Monte Carlo codes are most often well suited for the spent fuel cask analysis due to their use of continuous-energy cross sections and due to their capability to model complex heterogeneous geometry with very few approximations.9 Still, solving shielding problems with Monte Carlo codes requires tackling complex geometries, various types and distributions of radioactive sources and high statistical uncertainties of the results. Those challenges are especially acute for spent fuel cask deep-penetration shielding problems.10, 11
To support the spent fuel management in South Korea in terms of the shielding analysis of spent fuel casks with the Monte Carlo method, efforts have been taken to extend the capabilities of the Monte Carlo code MCS—developed at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea for the initial purpose of high-fidelity light-water-reactor analysis with thermal-hydraulics feedback—toward shielding analysis capabilities. Thus, this paper presents several features that have been introduced in the MCS code in order to address the challenges of shielding analysis for spent fuel casks.
Studies related to the spent fuel cask analysis with Monte Carlo codes highlight the need to apply variance reduction techniques (VRTs) in order to obtain reliable results within reasonable calculation times.12, 13 Among various existing VRTs, the weight window technique is a basic population control method widely used for Monte Carlo shielding calculations.14-16 The weight window technique can also be used in collaboration with other VRTs to enhance simulation performances. Thus, as an attempt to solve deep-penetration shielding problems effectively with MCS, and, as a good foundation for further code development, the weight-window VRT was selected for implementation in MCS. Other features selected for implementation that are important to facilitate the shielding studies deal with tally convergence diagnosis tools and user-friendly definition of complex geometries and sources.
For a better view of MCS capabilities regarding spent fuel cask shielding analysis, the weight window VRT, the tally convergence checks and the features related to the definition of geometry and sources are first introduced in Section 2. Then, the specifications for a TN-32 spent fuel cask17 loaded with 32 spent fuel assemblies, to be used as a reference shielding problem, are detailed in Section 3. The verification of MCS results for this TN-32 cask problem is consequently performed against the MCNP6 code for the following quantities: neutron dose rate (on the cask surface and 2 m away from the cask), primary photon dose rate from decay gamma photons (in the shielding wall) and secondary photon dose rate from photons generated by neutron interactions (on the cask surface). Finally, conclusions and perspectives for future work are drawn out.
2 COMPUTER CODES
Three codes are used in this study: two Monte Carlo codes, MCS and MCNP6, and one deterministic code, STREAM. The STREAM code provides the depleted fuel compositions and decay neutron and gamma source terms used in the Monte Carlo codes for the shielding analysis of the TN-32 cask.
2.1 UNIST Monte Carlo code MCS
MCS is a 3D continuous-energy neutron- and photon-physics code for particle transport based on the Monte Carlo method, under development at UNIST since 2013. Two kinds of calculations are allowed by MCS: (1) criticality runs for reactivity calculations with fuel depletion and thermal-hydraulics feedback18; and (2) fixed-source runs for shielding problems. MCS neutron transport capability is verified and validated against several benchmark problems, including ~300 cases from the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Experimental Problem (ICSBEP) database,19 the Small Modular Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (SMLFR),20 the Jordan Research and Training Reactor (JRTR)21 and the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR).22 The features implemented in MCS for deep-penetration shielding simulations are presented in details in this subsection.
2.1.1 Weight-window-based variance reduction
A weight window generator has been implemented in MCS based on a renovated concept of the weight window generation in MCNP.23 The main two improvements are as follows. First, in MCNP, during the weight-window generation phase, non-zero weights are only given to the meshes where a particle has traveled and caused a non-zero contribution to the target tally. In MCS, the particle current from one mesh to each neighboring mesh is tallied during the weight generation phase and allows to back-propagate non-zero weights to neighboring meshes, even in meshes where there have not been any scoring particles. This property makes it easier to generate relevant non-zero weights across all the meshes with MCS. Second, the weight window generator of MCNP requires a reference point to scale the weight values in each weight window mesh. This reference point, usually located in the source region, is subjected to the preference of each user and can be confusing to determine in the case of sources with large spatial distributions, as is typically the case in spent fuel casks. This issue is lifted in MCS by using an automatic scaling factor that does not require the choice of a reference point by the user.
More details about the automatic scaling factor of MCS are given in the following. The lower bound of the weight window in each mesh wL is determined at the end of the weight window generation as the ratio of two quantities: the total weight entering that mesh divided by the total score by particles entering that mesh.24 Only the relative wL values are determined by this ratio, and a scaling factor is necessary to adjust the magnitude of the weight windows. The scaling factor is commonly determined so that the weights of the initial source particles are inside the window, thus avoiding unnecessary rouletting or splitting of the source particles at birth.
The scaling factor has a direct effect on the simulations employing the weight windows for population control. A bigger scaling factor reduces the simulation time per initial particle due to the higher probability of the particles getting killed early by Russian roulette, but it also results in a higher standard deviation of the expected score due to fewer non-zero contributions to the tally. In contrast, a smaller scaling factor results in longer simulation time per initial particle since more particle splitting occurs, while the standard deviation of the expected score would be lower. Therefore, the choice of a good scaling factor is a trade-off between the simulation time and the standard deviation of the expected score. Whenever possible, an optimized scaling factor should aim at maximizing the simulation performance, ie, the figure of merit (FOM)24 defined as urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er5023:er5023-math-0001, where T is the calculation time in minutes and R is the relative error of the tally.
In MCNP, the scaling factor is calculated in the following way. The user must provide a reference point, and we name wL,ref the lower weight bound of the ‘reference’ mesh containing the reference point. The scaling factor CMCNP is then computed according to Equation 1:
@(1)
The meaning of Equation 1 is that the scaled lower bound of the reference mesh (= CMCNP × wL,ref) equals 0.5 so that initial particles with a weight of unity born in the reference mesh are never rouletted or split at birth. The values of the lower weight bounds of the other meshes are also multiplied by the scaling factor CMCNP. Consequently, in the case of a source with a large spatial distribution, MCNP may not scale optimally the wL values in the meshes other than the reference mesh since the scaling factor CMCNP was computed based only on the relative wL value of the reference mesh. Excessive rouletting or splitting of the source particles at birth may therefore happen in the other meshes.
In MCS, the automatic scaling factor removes the need for the user to indicate a reference mesh with a reference point. It is calculated by generalizing Equation 1 to an arbitrary number of meshes. In the general case where the sources are spatially distributed over the simulated geometry, the scaling factor CMCS in MCS is determined by the following equation:
@(2)
where i is the mesh index, wL,i is the relative lower weight bound value of mesh i and Ii is the source intensity of mesh i. Meshes with relative wL,i = 0 are skipped in Equation 2. The relative values of the lower weight bounds of all the meshes are then multiplied by CMCS. Compared with the MCNP approach, the calculation of CMCS from Equation 2 is similar to an average scaling over all the meshes that enables the initial source particles to have higher probability of being in the right weight window at birth across all the meshes and thus to minimize the mismatch between the weight windows and the sources to some extent. In the case of a point source (only one mesh has Ii > 0 and all the other meshes have Ii = 0), the Equation 2 naturally reduces to Equation 1 used by MCNP.
2.1.2 Tally convergence tests
Tally convergence diagnosis tools based on the 10 statistical checks of MCNP25 have been implemented in MCS. For each tally, MCS prints the empirical history score probability density functions, tally fluctuation charts and the results of the 10 statistical tests26 to help users evaluate the convergence of tallies. These diagnosis tools are especially useful for deep-penetration shielding problems where tally convergence is difficult to assess.
2.1.3 Source and geometry features
Fuel assemblies are usually modeled as a lattice in Monte Carlo calculations. Placing source terms into the corresponding cells of a lattice for fixed-source shielding calculation can be a cumbersome and tedious task. For improved user-friendliness, MCS allows the declaration of complex sources in a simple but effective manner using the concept of source universe, lattice and cell. An MCS input example of source specification is shown in Figure 1. In this example, a source universe is defined with the <suniverse> node. This source universe is made of a single source cell, whose shape (point, cylinder, box, or sphere) and dimensions are given in the shape and coeffs node attributes, respectively. Users can set the desired intensity, energy distribution and angular distribution by using the intensity, energy and direction node attributes, respectively (in absence of direction node attribute, default angular distribution is isotropic). Source universes can then be grouped together by using a <slattice> node, thus creating a source lattice. This source lattice is then handled as a single source cell filled by the lattice and translated to the suitable position in the geometry. Using all the possibilities of source cell, universe and lattice, multiple combinations of source shapes and spectra at different locations can be achieved with ease.

In addition, the geometry specification in MCS is also flexible when dealing with the loading of fuel assemblies with different dimensions, for instance loading patterns mixing 14 × 14, 16 × 16 and 17 × 17 fuel assembly types. A common issue in some Monte Carlo codes is that the size of one lattice cell must be equal or smaller than the size of the assembly universe that will fill the lattice cell. If the assembly universe is smaller, then undefined regions occur. This problem can be tricky to solve if the assemblies loaded in the lattice have different sizes, but it is solved automatically in MCS by filling up the excess regions not occupied by the assemblies with a material specified on the lattice card.
Finally, MCS provides automatic geometry checks to detect common mistakes in inputs such as overlapping cell or undefined regions, thus making it easier to model complex geometries. MCS inputs are based on the XML format (eXtended Markup Language) with allows for freedom in the use of blank lines and comments as long as the node structure is preserved. Alphanumeric names for surfaces, cells, universes, lattices and materials are allowed in MCS inputs for better, self-explaining inputs.
2.2 MCNP6 code
MCNP6 is a general-purpose 3D Monte Carlo code developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory with extensive applications in criticality, shielding, dosimetry and detector response.27 Notable features of MCNP6 include tally convergence tests (10 statistical checks) and several variance reduction techniques such as weight windows, DXTRAN and forced collision.28
2.3 STREAM code
STREAM (Steady state and Transient REactor Analysis code with Method of characteristics) is a deterministic code developed at UNIST and based on the method of characteristics to perform light-water reactor core calculations.29 STREAM features a depletion module30 with corresponding radiation source term calculation capabilities.31 STREAM can generate pin wise/assembly wise spent nuclear fuel isotopic inventory, radioactivity, decay heat, neutron and gamma source spectra for applications in spent nuclear fuel characterization, cask dose rate analysis, waste management, radiological safety and burnup credit applications.
3 SPECIFICATIONS OF THE SHIELDING PROBLEM
3.1 Description of the TN-32 cask
The TN-32 cask is a dry storage cask designed to accommodate 32 spent fuel assemblies.32 The subcriticality of the system is ensured by boron absorbers placed between the assemblies and by an internal watertight design. The cask is 5.2 m tall with an outer diameter of 2.5 m. Radial shielding is ensured by a 24.13-cm-thick steel wall (cask body) surrounded by a 12.725-cm-thick neutron shielding layer. The top and bottom of the cask also incorporate steel and neutron absorber to provide adequate shielding. The radial and axial layouts of the TN-32 are illustrated in Figure 2. The TN-32 cask is selected in this study because it is a real cask design satisfying the regulatory requirements of 10 CFR 7233 for spent fuel storage, and it can be used for the storage of high-burnup Westinghouse-type fuels.34 The 36.855-cm-thick radial shielding wall of the TN-32 cask makes the determination of the flux/dose levels outside of the cask a complex deep-penetration shielding problem for Monte Carlo codes.

3.2 Spent fuel material compositions and source terms
Assembly-wise compositions as well as neutron and gamma source terms of several 14 × 14 Westinghouse fuel assemblies (FAs) discharged from a Westinghouse two-loop power plant are generated with the deterministic code STREAM based on the initial enrichments, power history, burnup and cooling time of the assemblies. The IDs and burnups of the studied FAs are listed in Table 1. The FA-wise source terms generated by STREAM comprise 16-energy-group neutron spectra and 39-energy-group photon spectra for each depleted assembly. The dependence of the decay neutron and gamma spectra as a function of burnup is illustrated in Figure 3 for six assemblies at different burnup levels. Decay neutrons are most likely emitted in the energy range 1–2 MeV. Nearly half of the decay photons are emitted at low energy ranges, below 100 keV, while the other half corresponds to the 661.7 keV peak of Cesium 137. The total neutron intensity and gamma intensity of the 32 assemblies amounts to 1.60 × 109 neutrons/s and 3.05 × 1016 photons/s, respectively.

4 SHIELDING ANALYSIS
The spent fuel assemblies are loaded in the cask with a typical cask loading pattern35 shown in Figure 4. This loading pattern has lower burnup FAs at the periphery of the cask to act as extra shielding for FAs with high burnup located at the center. This type of loading can reduce the dose outside of the cask but will result in poorer cooling conditions in the thermal studies. For simplicity, the spacer grids are not modeled, and the top and bottom nozzle of the fuel assemblies are homogenized.

At first, criticality calculations are carried out to assure that the effective neutron multiplication factor (keff) of the cask does not exceed the standard safety criterion value of 0.95.36 Two cases are considered: cask filled with water to simulate the loading condition in reactor pools and cask filled with air to simulate the dry storage condition. The simulations are performed with the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library37 with 50 inactive cycles, 500 active cycles and 30 000 histories per cycle. The loading pattern adopted in this study satisfies the criticality safety criterion as the keff values are all below 0.95 in Table 2, with a good agreement within three standard deviations between MCS and MCNP6.

4.1 Without weight windows
As a preliminary analysis, the distribution of dose rates is calculated with MCS and then compared against MCNP6 for verification. The flux inside of the cask is calculated in a rectangular mesh tally with track-length estimator applied on the horizontal midplane and vertical midplane of the cask as shown in Figure 5. The horizontal mesh tally comprises 30 × 30 boxes and the axial mesh tally 30 × 44 boxes. The dimension of each box is fixed, equal to 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm.

Neutron/photon dose rates are obtained by convoluting the Monte Carlo neutron/photon flux per particle source with the isotropic flux-to-dose conversion coefficients provided in ICRP201038, 39 with log-log interpolation40 and then by multiplying by the total neutron/photon source intensity of the 32 assemblies. For consistency, all the calculations in MCS and MCNP6 employ the same libraries: ENDF/B-VII.1 library for neutron transport and eprdata12 library41 for photon transport. For the photon calculations, the thick-target bremsstrahlung option is turned on in both codes and the specific bremsstrahlung treatment for positrons is turned off in MCS. In total, 50 million neutron histories and 200 million photon histories are simulated for the neutron fixed-source case and photon fixed-source case, respectively.
The photon and neutron dose rates on the horizontal and vertical midplanes of the cask are presented in Figures 6 and 7. The red dash lines in the figures represent the cask wall projected on the corresponding planes. The relative difference between MCS and MCNP6 is calculated as MCS/MCNP6−1. The boxes where MCS and MCNP6 dose results agree with each other within three standard deviations are colored in yellow in the agreement subplots. Good agreement is observed inside the cask where the dose rates are converged.

Neutron dose rates (μSv/h) calculated by MCS and compared against MCNP6. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
Inside the cask, the photon dose rates are larger than the neutron dose rates and the dose rates drop sharply in the thick shielding layer and outside of the cask. Because no variance reduction is employed, the dose rates at the periphery of the cask are not converged. For instance, the dose rates calculated by MCS at the surface of the cask on the horizontal midplane (represented by a green dot in Figure 5) equal 3.85 μSv/h ± 16.7% for neutrons and 0 μSv/h ± 0% for photons. These results are considered unreliable. The high relative error could be reduced by using more histories, but significant simulation time would be required as the relative error is proportional to urn:x-wiley:0363907X:media:er5023:er5023-math-0004. Thus, the relative error in neutron dose rate could be reduced from 16.7 % to less than 10.0 % by using more than 139 million neutron histories instead of the initial 50 million neutron histories. As for the photon dose rate, even more histories would be required as 200 million histories are not enough to obtain one single non-zero contribution to the tally. This preliminary analysis highlights the need to apply variance reduction techniques in order to solve the TN-32 shielding problem.
The secondary photon dose rate (photon dose due to the gamma photons created by neutron interactions with the cask structure materials) is estimated by means of a coupled neutron-photon transport simulation with MCS. The coupled neutron-photon transport mode of MCS has been previously validated42 against several 14-MeV neutron transmission benchmarks of the SINBAD shielding database.43 The results are obtained in a simulation with 25 million neutron histories. The secondary photon dose rate at the green dot in Figure 5 reaches 1.88 μSv/h ± 6% for MCS and 1.79 μSv/h ± 8% for MCNP6 (agreement within one standard of deviation). The secondary photon dose outside of the cask can be determined without variance reduction because the gamma photons produced by neutron capture reactions in the shielding wall can have energies up to several MeV44 and thus can penetrate and come out of the shielding wall.
4.2 With weight windows
In this section, the calculations are conducted with the use of weight windows to obtain the neutron dose rate (on the cask surface and two meters away from cask) and primary photon dose rate (in the shielding wall). For the purpose of comparing the FOM values between MCS and MCNP6, the same computing conditions (CPUs type and number) are used for each calculation case as shown in Table 3.
Table 3. Cluster specification for each calculation.

Neutron dose rate in the surface side tally box	Intel Xeon 3.33 GHz (12 processors) + Intel Xeon 3.47 GHz (12 processors)

Neutron dose rate in the surface top tally box	Intel Xeon 2.40 GHz (27 processors)
Photon dose rate in the side tally box located in the resin layer	Intel Xeon 2.40 GHz (27 processors)
The neutron dose rates are first calculated in three 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm tally boxes located as shown in Figure 8 (surface side box, 2-m-away side box and top box). The calculations are conducted with the 10 statistical checks and weight window population control and generation turned on. In order to find a set of weights that approximates well the physical importance map of the problem, successive weight window iterations are applied.45 Indeed, generated weights can be a poor estimation of the physical importance map of the problem due to the statistical nature of Monte Carlo simulations. As such, applying weights generated once without iteration directly in a shielding calculation may give unreliable results, which do not pass all the statistical tests.46 During the iteration process, the weight windows generated for a target tally at the Nth run is applied to control the particle population of the (N + 1)th run, which also generates an updated set of weight windows.47, 48 This iteration process is repeated until the tally result passes all the 10 statistical checks; in which case it is assumed that the set of weights have converged toward a good approximation of the physical importance map of the problem. The iteration process is illustrated in Figure 9.

For the surface side tally box calculation, a 3D cylindrical mesh (30 × 4 × 68 uniform meshes in RTZ coordinate system covering the whole cask) is used for the weight window generation (ie, a weight window lower bound is determined in each mesh of the cylindrical mesh). Five million neutron histories are used for each iteration. The results for MCS and MCNP6 (mean, relative error, number of non-zero scores and FOM) are presented in Table 4. The neutron dose rate tally from MCS passes all the 10 checks after four iterations, and the tally from MCNP6 passes all the 10 checks after six iterations, with an agreement within one standard deviation for the finals results between MCS and MCNP6. A higher number of non-zero scores is obtained by MCS compared with MCNP6, resulting in lower relative errors at equal number of histories.

The impact of the four successive iterations on the MCS weight windows generated for the 3D cylindrical mesh with automatic scaling is illustrated in Figure 10 where the importance, ie, the inverse of wL values, is plotted for the meshes in the first azimuthal quarter (azimuthal mesh index equals one). The white regions correspond to meshes where wL = 0 (no contributions to the target tally or no particles entering the mesh), and only the default Russian roulette game is applied in those regions during the iterations. During the first iterations, as more and more neutrons are directed toward the regions of high importance and eventually reach the tally zone—the highest importance region, denoted by the yellow color—the number of non-zero scores to the target tally and the number of meshes with non-zero wL values both increase. Later, since the number of neutron histories in each simulation is fixed, the expansion of the meshes with non-zero wL values eventually stops.

A comparison of the merits of the MCS automatic scaling compared with the MCNP scaling is performed on the surface side tally box case. Using the relative weights determined during the four MCS iterations of Table 4, two sets of absolute weights can be calculated at each iteration: one set with MCS automatic scaling and one set with MCNP-style scaling. The position of the reference mesh for the MCNP-style scaling is shown in Figure 11. The side tally box case is rerun with MCS with the absolute weights scaled in the style of MCNP, and the results are shown in Table 5. The same computing conditions are used as in the previous calculation where automatic scaling is applied. The FOM values obtained with the MCNP scaling style in Table 5 are lower than the FOM values obtained with MCS automatic scaling in Table 4, thus showing on this example that the automatic scaling can offer higher FOM values during the iteration process.

The calculation of the neutron dose rate in the side box 2 m away from the cask surface is now performed. The same cylindrical mesh and same iterative approach as for the surface side tally box is applied, but, because this problem is more challenging to solve than the surface side tally case, 50 million neutron histories are used per iteration instead of 5 million histories. After four iterations, the dose rates from both MCS and MCNP6 pass all the statistical checks, and the results for the last iteration are presented in Table 6, with an agreement at one standard deviation between MCS and MCNP6. The neutron dose rate 2 m away from the cask surface is much lower than the regulation limit of 100 μSv/h.49

For the top tally box calculation, a 3D rectangular mesh (40 × 40 × 68 uniform meshes of size 6.5 cm × 6.5 cm × 7.7 cm covering the whole cask) is used for the weight window generation. The results (mean, relative error, number of non-zero scores and FOM) obtained without weight window and final results with weight windows that pass the 10 checks are summarized in Table 7 for MCS and MCNP6. Eleven iterations of 15 million histories and 19 iterations of 20 million histories are required, respectively, in MCS and in MCNP6 in order to pass all the 10 tests.

The primary photon dose rate (dose due to the decay gamma photons emitted by the spent fuel) is now estimated. Weight window generators require at least one non-zero score in the tally of interest to generate non-zero weights, and it was seen earlier in Section 4.1 that 200 million photon histories are not enough to obtain a single non-zero contribution in either the surface side tally box or top tally box outside of the cask. The photon shielding problem is therefore simplified by calculating the photon dose rate in a 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm side tally box located inside the cask in the resin shielding layer—the outer shielding region of the cask—instead of outside of the cask. Two 3D cylindrical meshes covering the whole cask are tested for weight window generation separately. Unconverged results of photon dose rates in this tally box for the first two iteration steps with each 3D cylindrical mesh are presented in Table 8. Although multiple iterations of 500 million photon histories are run, photon dose rates from both MCNP6 and MCS are not able to pass all the 10 statistical checks, meaning that further VRTs need to be applied in addition to weight window in order to calculate the primary photon dose rate on the surface of the cask.

The determination of the primary photon dose rate is a difficult task for Monte Carlo codes because most of the decay photons have low energies and cannot penetrate the shielding layers of the cask. Normalized results for photon dose rate in the resin-layer tally box are in the order of 10-16 μSv/h per photon source. However, the intensity of the decay gamma source is immense, in the order of 1016 photon/s. When multiplying the Monte Carlo normalized result with the decay gamma source intensity, the resulting photon dose rate can be significant. It must be checked rigorously that the total neutron and photon dose rate on the surface of the cask is below the permissible limit of 2000 μSv/h.49
5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The Monte Carlo code MCS developed at UNIST has been applied for the shielding analysis of a spent fuel cask of type TN-32. Dose rate calculation outside of the cask with weight windows and 10 statistical checks were performed. The MCS weight window shows good performance for the neutron shielding problems with the use of an automatic scaling factor to scale the relative lower bounds produced by the weight window generator. The capability of MCS to calculate reliable neutron dose rates up to 2 m away from the cask surface is verified against MCNP6. However, the determination of the primary photon dose rate at the periphery of the cask requires further efforts. The secondary photon dose rate outside of the cask is shown to be much lower than the neutron dose rate and primary photon dose rate, but it should still be considered for adequate cask shielding analysis.
Future development efforts envisioned for MCS in the field of variance reduction and deep-penetration shielding include point detectors and DXTRAN spheres as they can be used in combination with weight windows for a more effective variance reduction. The implementation of energy-dependent weight window generation is also planned. Other perspectives include the refinement of the depleted fuel compositions and source terms used for the spent fuel assemblies loaded in the TN-32 model. In this study, assembly-wise fuel compositions and source terms are employed but the fuel compositions and source intensities should be modeled separately for each fuel pin and should also take into account the axial variations of burnup. Finally, gamma sources from activation products, especially activated spacer grids, should also be modeled to obtain a more complex but accurate model of spent fuel casks.
