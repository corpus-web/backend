Abstract
Uranium metal used for fabrication of fuel for research reactors in India is generally produced by magnesio-thermic reduction of UF4. Performance of magnesio-thermic reaction and recovery and quality of uranium largely depends on properties of UF4. As ammonium diuranate (ADU) is first product in powder form in the process flow-sheet, properties of UF4 depend on properties of ADU. ADU is generally produced from uranyl nitrate solution (UNS) for natural uranium metal production and from uranyl fluoride solution (UFS) for low enriched uranium metal production. In present paper, ADU has been produced via both the routes. Variation of uranium recovery and crystal structure and composition of ADU with progress in precipitation reaction has been studied with special attention on first appearance of the precipitate Further, ADU produced by two routes have been calcined to UO3, then reduced to UO2 and hydroflorinated to UF4. Effect of two different process routes of ADU precipitation on the characteristics of ADU, UO3, UO2 and UF4 were studied here.

1. Introduction
The role of research reactors for the development of a nuclear program of any country is well established [1], [2], [3]. Research reactors are utilized to produce radioisotopes and offer irradiation facilities for testing various nuclear fuel and structural materials [4], [5]. Radioisotopes such as Co-60, Cs-137, and I-131 are used in the fields of medicine, industries, agriculture, and food processing [6]. Apart from these, research reactors are also used for neutron beam research activity, testing neutron detectors, testing materials for mew power plant, training of manpower, etc. With a rapid expansion of the nuclear program in India, more research reactors are needed for nuclear technology as they contribute to the creation of essential infrastructure for research and for building capabilities. Metallic uranium of very high purity has been used for the production of research reactor fuel. Uranium production processes are categorized into four groups as follows: (1) reduction of uranium halides with metals, (2) reduction of uranium oxides with metal and carbon, (3) electrolytic reduction, and (4) disproportionation or thermal decomposition of uranium halides [7]. Reduction of uranium tetrafluoride with calcium or magnesium is one of the main industrial methods for producing pure uranium ingot. Ammonium diuranate (ADU) is the first intermediate product in solid powder form in the flow sheet of uranium metal ingot production [8]. ADU is generally produced from uranyl nitrate for natural uranium fuel production and from uranyl fluoride for low enriched uranium fuel production. In both the production processes, uranyl solution (either nitrate or fluoride) reacts with ammonia (either gaseous or aqueous form) and precipitation occurs when the concentration of the product (ADU) exceeds its solubility.
(1)UO2 (NO3)2 + NH3 + H2O → (NH4)2U2O7 (ADU) ↓ + NH4NO3 + H2O
(2)UO2F2 + NH3 + H2O → (NH4)2U2O7 (ADU) ↓ + NH4F + H2O
This process is called reactive precipitation or crystallization. Reaction, nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and breakage are the kinetics of reactive precipitation [9], [10]. As the formula suggests, the ratio of NH3:U should be 1; however, several authors [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] reported variable NH3:U ratios, varying from 0.15 to 0.6 depending on the production procedure. However, practically no systematic study was carried out to observe how the composition and structure of ammonium uranate change during the course of precipitation. ADU is further calcined to UO3. The UO3 is then reduced to UO2, followed by hydrofluorination of UO2 to UF4. Uranium metal ingot is produced by magnesio-thermic reduction (MTR) of UF4. The performance of MTR reaction and recovery of uranium largely depend on the properties of UF4 [19], [20], [21]. UF4 normally contains a small amount of uranyl fluoride (UO2F2), known as a water-soluble content; unconverted uranium oxides; moisture, and a small amount of free acid (HF). UO2F2 in UF4 plays a major role in the reduction reaction. UO2F2, when heated in the presence of moisture, hydrolyzes to UO3 and HF. UO3 remains unreduced during the MTR, and as a result, the bomb yield decreases. HF reacts with magnesium and forms a refractory MgF2 film on magnesium, which hinders the vaporization of magnesium chips and the triggering of the reaction is delayed. Hydrogen generated by this side reaction reacts with UO2F2, producing harmful HF again. The unconverted uranium oxide present in the green salt is a mixture of all the unhydrofluorinated oxides. These oxides neither get reduced during the course of the reaction nor get dissolved in the slag, and as a result, reduce the fluidity of the slag and the separation of metal and slag. The tap density of UF4 is also important for the performance of MTR operation [5], [21]. In the present study, ADU has been produced by reactions of gaseous ammonia with both uranyl nitrate and uranyl fluoride. The progress of ADU precipitation has been observed very closely, with special attention on the first appearance of the precipitate for both nitrate and fluoride routes. Changes of recovery and composition with pH and time have also been observed during the course of precipitation. ADU produced by both the routes have been calcined to UO3, further reduced to UO2, and hydrofluorinated to UF4 under similar conditions. Both chemical and physical properties of the products have been analyzed carefully to understand how the properties of UF4 are inherited from its precursors.
2. Materials and methods
ADU precipitation reaction was carried out in a 3 L agitated glass reactor (10 of Fig. 1) of 0.150 m diameter. The reactor was fitted with four equally spaced 15-mm-wide baffles. A schematic drawing of the precipitator is shown in Fig. 1. Gaseous ammonia (99.9% pure) from a commercial-grade ammonia cylinder (1) was mixed with air from a compressor (4) at a ratio of 1:10, and the mixture gas was introduced through a ring sparger (14). The flow rates of ammonia and air were continuously controlled using two separate valves and calibrated rotameters (7 and 8). Uranium concentration and temperature of both the feed solutions were 65 g/L and 50°C, respectively. A pitched blade turbine-type impeller (11) was used, and the rotational speed of the impeller was maintained at 8.33 r/s. To study the progress of the ADU precipitation process, pH of the solution was continuously monitored through a pH meter (18). Samples (aliquot) were withdrawn after regular intervals. The collected samples were filtered using a Büchner funnel (20) connected with a vacuum pump (22), and the filtrate was collected in a conical flask (21). The cake was then washed with distilled water. The pH and uranium concentration in the filtrate were measured. Furthermore, the cake was naturally dried. The crystal structure of dried ADU was measured using X-ray diffraction or XRD (Model: Equinox 3000; INEL) with a position sensitive detector (PSD) detector at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα (1.5406 Å) radiation. Furthermore, the final ADU, produced from both uranyl nitrate solution (UNS) and uranyl fluoride solution (UFS), was calcined in similar condition. Calcination was carried out in a box-type furnace (Fig. 2). Temperature was increased from room temperature to 550°C at a ramp rate of 5°C/min and then maintained at 550°C for 4 hours. Then the heating was stopped. The crystal structure, fluoride content, particle size, specific surface area (SSA), and O/U ratio of UO3 were measured. Furthermore, UO3 was reduced by passing NH3 gas over the static bed of UO3 at 750°C inside a box furnace (Fig. 3). The furnace was heated at a ramp rate of 6.25°C/min, and argon was fed continuously until the temperature reached 750°C. NH3 gas was then fed over UO3 at a rate of 8–10 L/min. Similar operating conditions were maintained in both cases. The crystal structure, fluoride content, particle size, SSA, and O/U ratio of UO2 were measured. UF4 was produced thereafter by passing anhydrous HF gas over the static bed of UO2 at 450°C inside a box furnace. A schematic drawing of the hydrofluorination furnace is shown in Fig. 4. The furnace was heated at a ramp rate of 5°C/min. Argon was purged until the temperature reached 450°C. HF was then purged for 30 minutes at 450°C. Similar operating conditions were maintained in both cases. The crystal structure, particle size, tap density, and UO2F2 and uranium oxide contents of UF4 were measured. A list of the instruments and methodologies used is shown in Table 1.

3. Results and discussion
In the present study, ADU was produced by two different routes: (1) by reaction of UNS with gaseous ammonia (ADUI) and (2) by reaction of UFS with gaseous ammonia (ADUII). Studies on the progress of ADU precipitation in both routes were carried out, with special attention on the first appearance of the precipitate and changes in uranium recovery and crystal structure with time. Then ADU produced by the two routes were calcined to UO3, further reduced to UO2, and hydrofluorinated to UF4. The effect of the two different process routes of ADU precipitation on the characteristics of ADU, UO3, UO2, and UF4 were studied here.
3.1. Changes in pH, uranium recovery, and structure of ADU with progress of precipitation reaction
Variation in pH and uranium recovery in filtrate with time, during ADU precipitation from UNS, is shown in Fig. 5. It was observed that initially there was a slow increase of pH (region 0–1), then there was a sudden small reduction in pH (region 1–2) followed by an almost flat zone (region 2–3), and then there was a sharp increase in pH (region 3–4) followed by a slow increase in pH (region 4–5). The explanation for this is that initially ammonia neutralized the free acid present in the UNS; as a result, pH of the solution was increased. A small reduction of pH occurred due to the generation of H+ ions at the start of precipitation [22]. It was further noticed from the uranium recovery versus time plot that precipitation started only after reaching a certain pH. Recovery has been calculated based on the initial concentration of uranium in the solution and the concentration of uranium in the filtrate at any moment. The first precipitation point was detected by the appearance of permanent turbidity, which was found to coincide with the reduction of pH. It was also observed that around 90% recovery of uranium took place at the end of the flat zone. Recovery was further increased to 99.98% when pH reached 7.5. Almost no improvement in recovery was observed when pH was further increased to 8.5. Slurry samples were collected at the first precipitation point (I1; pH 3.19), in between (I2; pH 3.18) the flat zone, at the end point (I3; pH 3.52) of the flat zone, at pH 7.5 (I4), and at pH 8.5 (I5). ADUI1 was very sticky and became hard lumps during drying. ADUI2 and ADUI3 were not sticky, but they became soft lumps during drying. ADUI4 and ADUI5 were very easily filterable and converted to powder during drying. XRD patterns of these ADUs are shown in Fig. 6. The color of the ADU at every stage of the reaction was yellowish. ADUI1 and ADUI2 were found to be orthorhombic 3UO3.NH3.5H2O (JCPDF 043-0365) [16]. It was also noticed that another phase appeared with a further increase of ammonia addition. It was studied that ADUI3, ADUI4, and ADUI5 were multiphasic compounds, and consisted of orthorhombic 3UO3.NH3.5H2O and hexagonal 2UO3.NH3.3H2O (JCPDF 044-0069) [16]. It was further observed that with an increase of ammonia addition, dominancy of the hexagonal structure was increased.

Variation of pH and uranium concentration with time during ADU precipitation by the reaction between UFS and gaseous ammonium is shown in Fig. 7. Unlike Fig. 5, pH of the solution was increased continuously and no flat zone was observed in the graph. However, precipitation started only after reaching a certain pH as earlier, but the pH (at pH 5.98) was higher than that in case of precipitation from UNS (at pH 3.19). Recovery of uranium at any pH in the UFS route was lower than that in the UNS route. More than 99% recovery was observed only at and above pH 9. Total time required for 99% conversion was 143 minutes from UFS, whereas it was only 32 minutes from UNS.

Slurry samples were collected at the first precipitation point (II1; pH 5.98), pH 6.74 (II2), pH 7.5 (II3), pH 7.85 (II4), pH 8.5 (II5), and pH 9 (II6). Green gelatinous precipitate (ADUII1) was obtained at the inception. ADUII2 and ADUII3 were little sticky and became hard lumps during drying. ADUII4 was not sticky and became soft lumps during drying. ADUII5 and ADUII6 were easily filterable and became powder on pressing during drying. The color of the ADU was nicely changed from green to khaki to brownish to greenish yellow. An XRD pattern of these ADUs is shown in Fig. 8. It has been observed that ADU produced at the inception (ADUII1) consisted of orthorhombic (NH4)3UO2F5 (JCPDF 021-0802) [23]. ADUII2 consisted of orthorhombic (NH4)3UO2F5 and (NH4) (UO2)2F5.4H2O (hexagonal) (JCPDF 026-0095) [24], with dominancy of (NH4)3UO2F5. ADUII3 consisted of (NH4)3UO2F5, (NH4)(UO2)2F5.4H2O, and hexagonal 2UO3.NH3.3H2O (JCPDF 044-0069) [16], with dominancy of (NH4)3UO2F5. ADUII4–ADUII6 consisted of (NH4)3UO2F5), (NH4) (UO2)2F5.4H2O, and 2UO3.NH3.3H2O, with increased dominancy of 2UO3.NH3.3H2O, which increased with ammonia addition.

3.2. Effect of two different process routes of ADU precipitation on the characteristics of ADU, UO3, UO2, and UF4
The final ADU, which was produced via UNS (ADUI4) and UFS (ADUII6) routes, was further calcined, reduced, and then hydrofluorinated under similar conditions. UO3, UO2, and UF4, which were produced via the UNS route, are written as UO3I, UO2I, and UF4I, respectively, and UO3, UO2, and UF4, which were produced via the UFS route, are written as UO3II, UO2II, and UF4II, respectively. It has been observed from Table 2 that UO2F2 and uranium oxide contents were more in UF4 obtained via the UFS route than in that obtained via the UNS route. UO2F2 has been generated due to the reaction of HF with unconverted UO3 present in UO2, which depends on the conversion of UO3 to UO2 and indicated by the O/U ratio of UO2. The more the O/U ratio of UO2, the more the presence of UO3 in UO2. Conversion of UO3 to UO2 depends on an SSA of UO3 and the O/U ratio of UO3. Table 3 indicates that the SSA of UO3 obtained from the UNS route is more than that obtained from the UFS route. The SSA of UO3 mainly depends on the particle size and morphology of UO3. It has been noted from Table 3 that the mean particle size of UO3 obtained from the UFS route is more than that of the UNS route. Ammonia released during calcination reduces UO3 [25], [26]. Reduction of calcined product of ADU produced via the UFS route is less due to the presence of fluoride in ADU. As a result, the O/U ratio of UO3 from the UNS route is lesser than that from the UFS route. The content of uranium oxide in UF4 indicates conversion of UO2 to UF4, which depends on the SSA of UO2. Table 4 shows that the SSA of UO2 obtained from the UNS route is more than that from the UFS route. Similarly, the SSA of UO2 mainly depends on the particle size and morphology of UO2. It has been observed from Table 4 that the mean particle size of UO2 obtained from the UFS route is more than that from the UNS route. It is further noticed that the tap density of UF4 obtained from the UNS route is more than that from the UFS route (Table 2). It has been observed from Table 5 that the mean particle size of ADU obtained from the UFS route is more than that from the UNS route, and the SSA of ADU obtained from the UNS route is more than that from the UFS route. It is further noted that particle size was reduced from ADU to UO3 to UO2 to UF4.

The XRD pattern (Fig. 9) shows that ADUI4 consisted of orthorhombic 3UO3.NH3.5H2O (PDF 043-0365) and hexagonal 2UO3.NH3.3H2O (PDF 044-0069), and ADUII6 consisted of orthorhombic (NH4)3UO2F5 (JCPDF 021-0802), hexagonal (NH4).(UO2)2F5.4H2O (PDF 026-0095), and hexagonal 2UO3.NH3.3H2O, with dominancy of 2UO3.NH3.3H2O. The XRD patterns of the calcined product of ADU, produced from both UNS and UFS routes, are shown in Fig. 10. Both the UO3I and the UO3II are basically mixture of UO3 and U3O8, which is clearly indicated by O/U ratio of UO3 (Table 3). It is further observed from the XRD patterns that UO3I consisted of orthorhombic UO3 (PDF 072-0246) [27] and orthorhombic U3O8 (PDF 047-1493) [28], and UO3II consisted of hexagonal UO3 (PDF 031-1416) [29] and hexagonal U3O8 (PDF 074-2102) [30]. However, both patterns (Fig. 11) of UO2 matched with those reported in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database (PDF number 00-041-1422) [31] for the cubic structure. X-ray phase analysis (Fig. 12) of UF4I and UF4II matched with those reported in the ICDD database (PDF number 082-2317) [32] for the monoclinic structure.

4. Conclusion
Uranium metal used for fabrication of fuel for a research reactor is generally produced by metallothermic reduction of UF4. The performance of metallothermic reaction and the recovery of uranium largely depend on the properties of UF4. As ADU is the first powder product in the process flowsheet, properties of UF4 largely depend on the properties of ADU. In the present paper, ADU is produced via both routes. Variation of uranium recovery and composition of ADU, with change in time, has been studied. It was observed that initially pH increased slowly. Then there was a small reduction in pH followed by an almost flat zone, and then there was a sharp increase in pH followed by a slow increase in pH. The first precipitation point was detected by the appearance of turbidity, which was further found to coincide with the reduction of pH. ADU obtained at inception via the UNS route consisted of orthorhombic 3UO3.NH3.5H2O. Another hexagonal phase (2UO3.NH3.3H2O) appeared in ADU with further addition of NH3. It was further observed that pH of the solution increased continuously during ADU precipitation via the UFS route. However, precipitation started at a higher pH and uranium recovery was less compared with the production via the UNS route. It was further studied that the ADU produced at the inception via the UFS route consisted of (NH4)3UO2F5 (orthorhombic), and with further addition of ammonia, composition of ADU was changed and it became a mixture of (NH4)3UO2F5 (orthorhombic), 2UO3.NH3.3H2O (hexagonal), and (NH4) (UO2)2F5.4H2O (hexagonal). The extent of 2UO3.NH3.3H2O (hexagonal) increased with the progress of a reaction. Uranium recovery during ADU precipitation via the UNS route is more than that via the UFS route. The reduction of UO3 to UO2 is less in the UFS route than in the UNS route due to the presence of fluoride in ADU and subsequent UO3. This causes an increase of UO2F2 content in UF4 produced via the UFS route. The SSA of UO2, obtained from the UFS route is less than that from the UNS route. This is why the UF4 produced via the UFS route contained more unconverted uranium oxide than the UF4 produced via the UNS route. Crystal-phase analysis shows that, in spite of the different compositions of the ADU produced by the two routes, the crystal structures of UO2 and UF4 produced by two different routes were similar.
