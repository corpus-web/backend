Abstract
Tc play an important role in U/Pu partition when U(IV) is used as reducing agent in PUREX process. In this work, U/Pu partition flowsheet experiments were studied using different organic reducing agents, which included N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine (DMHAN)–methylhydrazine (MMH), acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and dihydroxyurea (DHU). The results showed very good U/Pu partition performance in the presence of Tc, which mean Tc would not cause major malfunctions in the U/Pu partition operation with these reducing agents. The technetium fractions distributed in the products was mainly attributed to Tc(VII) reduction kinetics with different reducing agents.
Introduction
The PUREX (Plutonium Uranium Reduction Extraction) process has been used in the last few decades for the recovery of U and Pu from the irradiated nuclear fuel. In PUREX process, U/Pu partition is achieved by the reduction of extractable Pu(IV) to inextractable Pu(III), U(IV) is the mostly used reducing agent, and always used with hydrazine which can scavenge nitrous acid and then stabilise Pu(III). As Tc catalyses the destruction of U(IV)-hydrazine by nitric acid, it can influence the Pu(IV) reduction, and then cause major malfunctions in the U/Pu partition operation [1,2,3].
The development of organic reducing agents is important for the reprocessing flowsheets, on the basis of Pu reduction results from batch tests, three scheme for the application of organic reducing agents to the U/Pu partition have been proposed, and the optimised flow sheet for a 16 stage counter current process was designed, in which Pu(IV) is reduced by N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine (DMHAN), acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and dihydroxyurea (DHU), respectively, and DMHAN is used in conjunction with an HNO2 scavenger, methylhydrazine (MMH).
The primary objectives of the proposed research are to predict the effect of Tc with these newly developed organic reducing agents in U/Pu partition, since Tc may be responsible for high consumption of U(IV)-hydrazine and cause malfunctions in U/Pu partition operation. Therefore, in this study, the flowsheet experiments using DMHAN–MMH, AHA, DHU were performed, respectively.
Theory
The decontamination factor (DF) was a measure how well U and Pu had been separated, see Eq. (1), where C was component concentration in the solute.

Experimental
Reagents and equipments
The nitric acid solutions were prepared from dilution of concentrated nitric acid. As an extractant, 30% TBP in kerosene were made by suitable mixing of TBP and kerosene followed by scrubbing the mixture with 2.5% Na2CO3 solution, then by a 0.1 mol/L HNO3 wash, finally by deionized water wash to remove any acidic degradation products. DMHAN, MMH, DHU were synthesized in our laboratory. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.
Feed solution was prepared by contact of nitric acid solution of U(VI), Pu(IV) and Tc(VII) with 30% TBP in hydrocarbon diluent, Pu was maintained as Pu(IV) by the addition of N2O4, no less than 98% valence. NH4TcO4 was purchased from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and dissolved in distilled water.
Liquid scintillation spectrometer manufactured by Beckman was used for measurement of technetium, the cocktail solution used in liquid scintillation measurement was prepared by dissolving 1 g of triphosphoxane, 16 g of 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 300 g of naphthalene in 2 L dioxane.
A multistage miniature mixer-setters made of plexiglass are used for flowsheet experiments, the volumes of the mixer and the settler sections were 10 and 25 ml, respectively. Stirring speed in flowsheet experiments is about 1800 rpm.
Procedures
U/Pu partition flowsheet is shown in Fig. 1. The process comprised of 6 stages for U scrubbing, and 10 stages for Pu stripping.

Flowsheet of U/Pu partition
Flowsheet experiment using DMHAN–MMH and AHA were done employing a multistage mixer-setter, with a residence time in the mixer about 1 min, flowrates of feed, solvent, stripping solution were 6.04 mL/min, 1.51 mL/min, 1.51 mL/min, respectively. Flowsheet experiment using DHU was performed in tubes, with a mixing time about 1 min. The feed and the collected fractions were sampled, all experiments were performed at room temperature.
Analysis
The concentration of U(VI) was determined by a potassium dichromate titration method after U(VI) was reduced to U(IV). Alpha-ray spectrometer was used to determine the concentrations of Pu. The Pu valence in the feed solution was confirmed as Pu(IV) by absorption spectrometry of the ultraviolet–visible region. The acid concentration of the solution was determined by acid base titration. Tc(VII) concentration was detected using liquid scintillation method after it was extracted by 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine in alkaline solution [4].
Results and discussion
Process parameters
The flowsheet experiments were carried out in the glove box, the process parameters were described in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

U/Pu partition performance
Table 4 showed the DF in flowsheet experiments. As shown in the results, U and Pu mass balances were acceptable. The Pu strip proved to be efficient even in the presence of Tc, DFPu/U was above 105, which means, unlike U(IV)-hydrazine, using these organic reducing agents, Tc will not influence the Pu(IV) reduction significantly. 6 extraction stages were sufficient to efficiently scrub U, although DFU/Pu with AHA seems lower than the case with DMHAN and DHU, it is caused by a short time solvent injection failure in mixer-setter. Another flowsheet experiment performed in tubes with the same process parameters showed that, DFU/Pu was 1.5 × 105.
Table 4 Decontamination factors in flowsheet experiments
In the classical PUREX process, U(IV)-hydrazine is used as reducing agent in U/Pu partition. As Tc catalyses the destruction of U(IV)-hydrazine by nitric acid, it can cause major malfunctions in Pu(IV) reduction. Oxidation of U(IV) with nitric acid in aqueous solution was catalyzed by Tc(VII) and Tc(IV) species, the catalytic cycle involved fast reduction of Tc(VII) with U(IV): 2TcO4− + 3U4+→ 2TcO2++ 3UO22+, and slow oxidation of Tc(IV) to Tc(VII) [5]. Study showed that [6], because of fast reduction of Tc(VII) with U(IV), induction period in Tc-hydrazine system disappeared when U(IV) was introduced, thus the reaction between Tc(VII) and U(IV)-hydrazine would start from fast reaction period, which lead to the malfunctions in in Pu(IV) reduction.
Unlike U(IV), reduction of Tc(VII) with DHU and AHA were not fast, even in the case of DMHAN–MMH, about 60% MMH was left in Pu product in flowsheet experiment, and DMHAN almost not reduce Tc(VII), which mean the content of organic reducing agents were enough to reduce Pu(IV), these kinetic results were consistent with good U/Pu partition performances in flowsheet experiments. Another difference was that, U(IV) could be extracted, the organic reducing agents tested basically not be extracted, oxidation of U(IV) with nitric acid in organic solution was also catalyzed by Tc ions [7], which might be another factor preventing the achievement of the required Pu stripping performance with U(IV)-hydrazine in the presence of Tc.
Tc fractions in the products
Table 5 showed Tc fractions distributed in the products in flowsheet experiments. When DMHAN–MMH were used in strip solution, more than 99% of Tc was back-extracted from the solvent stream loaded with U and flowed to the Pu product. When DHU was used in strip solution, about 75% of Tc flowed to the Pu product. When AHA was used in strip solution, although we failed to get a good Tc mass balance in flowsheet experiment, it seemed less Tc flowed to the Pu product compared with DHU. For the bad mass balance of Tc obtained with AHA, it might be due to the accumulation of technetium in the mixer-settlers because of reduction and oxidation of Tc, which result in very long time for good Tc mass balance, unfortunately, profiles of Tc was not obtained for further discussion.
Table 5 Tc fractions distributed in the products in flowsheet experiments
In the U/Pu partition, the behavior of Tc was controlled by both its redox characteristics and the distribution ratio of Tc. Tc(VII) has a moderate partitioning coefficient in TBP/kerosene–HNO3 system [8,9,10,11], but the low valence Tc basically not be extracted, therefore the reaction between Tc and reducing agents has a crucial influence on Tc distribution. The flowsheet results could be well explained by comparison of reaction between reducing agents and Tc(VII).
DMHAN would not reduce Tc(VII) in HNO3 solution. There was an induction period in the reduction reaction between MMH and Tc(VII), the overall rate equation in induction period was −d[Tc(VII)]/dt = kTc–U,i[Tc(VII)][UO22+][MMH]0.5[HNO3]−0.3, where kTc–U,i = 0.042 ± 0.003(mol/L)−1.2min−1. After the induction period, low-valence Tc had been accumulated, there was a fast reaction period, the overall rate equation in fast reaction period was −d[Tc(VII)]/dt = kTc–U,f[Tc(VII)][UO22+]0.3[HNO3]−0.2, where kTc–U,f = 0.043 ± 0.002(mol/L)−0.1min−1 [12]. Although there was an induction period in the reaction between MMH and Tc(VII), low-valence Tc would accumulate in the flowsheet experiment performed in mixer-settlers (only 15–25% Tc existed as Tc(VII) in Pu production, low-valence Tc can be oxidized by potassiumdichromate and then be extracted by 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine in alkaline solution), thus the reaction between Tc(VII) and MMH would start from the fast reaction period. With the overall rate equation in fast reaction period, t1/2 was calculated to be 2.57 min under condition of flowsheet experiment. With residence time in a single mixer about 1 min, there is at least 10 min for the reaction between Tc(VII) and MMH in mixer-settlers, which mean more than 95% Tc(VII) could be reduced to low valence Tc. That was consistent with flowsheet experiment results, more than 99% Tc flowed to the Pu product. Another flowsheet experiment performed in tubes with the same process parameters showed that, since all aqueous solution was transferred to another tube, low-valence Tc was not accumulated, the reaction between Tc(VII) and MMH in strip solution would start from the reduction reaction period, thus only 48% Tc flowed to the Pu product.
In the case of DHU, kinetic study of the reaction between DHU and Tc(VII) in aqueous HNO3 medium showed that [13], the apparent reaction rate equation was r = −d[Tc(VII)]/dt = k·[Tc(VII)]1·[DHU]0.79·[H+]0.77. At 25 °C, k = 0.140 ± 0.022 (mol/l)−1.56min−1. t1/2 was calculated to be 69 min under condition of flowsheet experiment, therefore, less Tc(VII) was reduced compared with the case of DMHAN–MMH, about 75% Tc flowed to the Pu product when DHU was used as reducing agent.
In the case of AHA, study showed that, AHA was capable of reducing pertechnetate (TcO4−) in nitric acid to form the extremely hydrophilic and stable Tc(II) transaquo-nitrosyldiacetohydroxamate, [TcII(NO)(AHA)2(H2O)]+, which was not extracted into TBP/dodecane [14]. Nevertheless, kinetic study of the reaction between AHA and Tc(VII) in aqueous HNO3 medium showed that [15], the apparent reaction rate equation was r = −d[Tc(VII)]/dt = k’·[Tc(VII)]·[AHA]1.6. t1/2 was determined to be 16.5 h under condition of 18 °C, c(AHA) = 1.0 mol/L and c(HNO3) = 0.5 mol/L, therefore, less Tc flowed to the Pu product compared with the case of DHU.
Conclusions
The flowsheets had shown to efficiently separate U and Pu in the presence of Tc, with N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine and methylhydrazine, acetohydroxamic acid, dihydroxyurea as reducing agents, respectively, which mean, unlike U(IV)-hydrazine, using these organic reducing agents, Tc would not cause major malfunctions in the U/Pu partition operation.
The Tc fractions distributed in the products of the processes were compared, the difference was mainly attributed to Tc(VII) reduction kinetics with different reducing agents.
