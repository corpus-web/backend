Abstract
The presented work describes an effective method for 226Ra determination using laboratory- prepared MnO2-SiO2 composite resin. Samples were traced with 133Ba for radium radiochemical recoveries monitoring which were in the range of (77 – 100%). MnO2- SiO2 composite resin was used to collect for 226Ra from water samples (pH = 6.5–7.0). Radium was eluted from the column with 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3 at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min−1. Alpha-spectrometric counting of Ba(Ra)SO4 microprecipitate was used for 226Ra determination. The new developed method was used to the 226Ra determination in samples of natural mineral, mountain spring, drinking and natural healing waters from Slovakia and Czech Republic.

1. Introduction
The radium isotope of the greatest concern is 226Ra. 226Ra is one of the most toxic alpha-emitters in the environment (T1/2 = 1622 years) and is produced by the radioactive decay of 238U. It has always attracted special attention because of the health risks associated with drinking water. Although there is some metabolic discrimination of radium because of its high mass number, it tends to follow the same metabolic pathways as calcium (Marović et al., 1994).
The activity concentration of 226Ra in bottled mineral waters can vary and depends on the origin of the water (Palomo et al., 2007). 226Ra and its daughter nuclides in water are responsible for a major fraction of the internal dose received by the population from naturally occurring radionuclides (Moldovan et al., 2009). Thus, monitoring of 226Ra levels in mineral water is necessary for the purpose of protecting people from high radiation protection.
Concentration levels of 226Ra and natural uranium were analyzed in bottled mineral waters commercially available in Egypt. 226Ra was determined by applying a chemical procedure in which Ra was coprecipitated with Ba as a sulphate. The precipitate was dissolved with EDTA and then measured by liquid scintillation counting after mixing with a scintillation cocktail. The measured values of 226Ra concentration ranged from 5.8 to 39.2 mBq L−1 with an average value of 16.7 mBq L−1 (Higgy, 2000). The annual effective doses of 226Ra from spring water consumption ranged up to 86 microSv, while from mineral water the values were much higher. The highest 226Ra annual effective doses from mineral waters consumption were up to seven times higher than that recommended by WHO (100 microSv). The critical groups which consumed large amounts of mineral water were infants and teenagers (Bronzovic and Marovic, 2005). Therefore, the determination of the concentration of 226Ra in mineral water is important.
The 226Ra concentrations in bottled mineral waters commercially available in Romania were measured using the Lucas cell method. Samples with different bottling times (2006–2007) were investigated and 226Ra concentration higher than 100 mBq L–1 were determined (Moldovan et al., 2009).
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) freshly precipitated from large volumes of water up to 10 L effectively encloses a variety of dissolved radionuclides (e.g. radium, thorium, uranium, polonium, actinium and lead). Potassium permanganate and manganese dichloride were added to acidified water which had been previously spiked with an appropriate yield tracer and degassed to remove the CO2. Afterwards, the formation of MnO2 was initiated by raising the pH to 8–9 (Rodriguez-Alvarez and Sánchez, 1995). Rodriguez-Alvarez and Sánchez (1995) used KMnO4 and BaCl 2 + FeCl3 to collect of radium. This method was applied to different natural waters and soil samples. No differences were observed between the chemical yields obtained by the KMnO4 and BaCl2 + FeCl3 pre-concentration method. The Mn- or MnO2-fibre technique can concentrate Ra from a large volume of water, being especially effective for the enrichment of Ra from seawater with high salinity, and can make a method more sensitive. But individual cartridges have variable efficiences which range from 33% to 99% of Ra sorption (Colley and Thomson, 1994).
Manganese dioxide is widely used for the collection of radium from water samples. As demonstrated by Varga, 2007, a simple procedure was used for the preparation of MnO2 resin for 226Ra collection. To prepare MnO2 resin, 40 g of AG 1-X4 anion exchange resin (chloride form) and 40 mL of saturated KMnO4 solution was used. The formation of MnO2 was expected to be the result of the KMnO4 reacting with the chloride counter-ion adsorbed on the quaternary-amine of AG 1-X4 anion exchange resin (Varga, 2007).
A fast procedure for the determination of radium isotopes in aqueous samples based on radium sorption on MnO2 coated polyamide discs was presented by Eikenberg et al. (2001). The sample discs can be used directly for low-level alpha spectrometry without the need of further separation and preparation methods. MnO2-coated polyamide discs are suitable for the determination of radium isotopes at environmental levels.
Ďurecova described a new method for simultaneous determination of 226Ra and 228Ra in water by using 3 M's EMPORE TM Radium Rad Disks. This method is simple, quantitative and interferences-free, and eliminates the need for multiple precipitation steps or solvent extractions by conventional methods. They concluded that 133Ba can be used as a yield tracer of 226Ra. The method was not tested on water samples with a high soluble salts content, which may have exceeded the capacity of the disks. 226Ra was counted using conventional radon emanation techniques and 228Ra through its daughter nuclide 228Ac using a proportional counter. Different concentrations of di-ammonium hydrogen citrate were used for the elution of 228Ac and 226Ra from EMPORE TM Radium Rad Disks. The radium recovery was 99% using 40 mL of 0.2 mol L−1 diammonium hydrogen citrate pH 7.8 (Ďurecová, 1997).
A rapid method for 226Ra determination in water samples up to 10 L using MnO2–PAN (polyacrylonitrile) composite ion absorber was proposed and verified by Dulanská et al. (2015). Samples were traced with 133Ba to monitor radium radiochemical recoveries, which were in the range of (92−100) %. Radium was eluted with 20 mL of 6.5 mol L−1 and alpha-spectrometric counting of Ba(Ra)SO4 microprecipitate was used for 226Ra determination. The method developed was used for the 226Ra determination in 15 samples of natural mineral, mountain spring, drinking and natural waters from Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.
The aim of the work was to prepare an easy, cheap, quick and reproducible procedure for the 226Ra separation in mineral and drinking water using a composite resin based on silica gel and manganese dioxide. By combining the two different materials, a new type of sorbent with the advantages of both was prepared.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals, materials and radioactive standards
133Ba certified solution from the Czech Metrology Institute, No. 9031 – OL – 656/12 (LACOMED s.r.o., Řež), was added to every analyzed water sample as a chemical yield monitor. For the verification of the 226Ra method a certified solution (No. 9031 – OL – 653/11Slovenský metrologický ústav, Bratislava) was used. All other chemicals used were commonly-available, analytical grade acids and chemicals. The 25 mm Tuffryn®membrane filte 0.2 µm was used for the preparation of Ba(Ra)SO4 for α-specroscopy counting.
2.2. Instruments
133Ba was determined by counting on gamma spectrometer with high purity Ge detector EG&G ORTEC GEM 20190P, equipped with Gamma Vision-32bit, EG&G ORTEC software. The activity of the 226Ra was determined using alpha spectrometry. A two-chamber α - spectrometer 576A equipped with ULTRA™ ion-implanted silicon detectors and with a 600 mm2 active area was used for counting alpha radioactivity. The spectra were processed using the Alpha-Vision™ 32 –bit emulation software from the EG&G ORTEC company. The microstructures of the powders were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL 7600F machine equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX, Oxford Instruments X-Max 50 detector).
3. Experimental
3.1. Overview of methods and composite resin preparation
3.1.1. Preparation of the MnO2-SiO2 impregnated composite resin
For the preparation of the MnO2 – SiO2 composite resin, a sol-gel method was used. Solution no. 1 was prepared by mixing 19.7 g of KMnO4 with 1.2 L of HCl (37%) and 1.25 L−1 water glass. The solution no. 2 was prepared by mixing 1 L of 3% MnCl2·4H2O, 200 mL of HCl (37%), and 1.25 L water. Solutions no.1 and no.2 were mixed; the H2SiO3 gel and MnO2 suspension was stirred for 2 h and left to stand overnight. The precipitate which dispersed in the silica gel was filtered off, and washed with deionized water (4 L, pH 6.5–7) until a chloride test of the washed water come out negative. The filter cake was dried at 60 °C for 24 h. A chocolate-brown amorphous powder, about 195–200 g, was sieved (grain sizes < 0.15 mm; 0.5 mm; > 0.5 mm) and the 0.5 mm grains were analyzed. The Mn content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer 1100) as 3.5%.
3.1.2. Characterization of the composite resin
The determination of the surface area was calculated by adsorption of argon at 77 K, in accordance with to the method of Brunauer et al. (1938). The surface area of the 0.5 mm grains was 40 m2 g−1.
The prepared sorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the fast coincidence PALS spectrometer. The fast coincidence PALS spectrometer with a time resolution of about 350 ps was used for lifetime measurements at 298 K. The instrumental resolution function was measured by defect free Al samples. Corrections for the annihilation of positrons in the source was taken into account. The program for the evaluation of the lifetime spectra was MELT for lifetime distributions (Shukla et al., 1993). Calculating the free volume size from the measured o-Ps lifetime was made by EELViS routine (Zaleski, 2009). Positron lifetimes were measured for both samples in a vacuum (10−6 mbar).
3.2. Optimization of 133Ba (Ra) separation on the MnO2- SiO2 composite resin
3.2.1. Influence of pH on 133Ba(Ra) separation
133Ba was used as the radium tracer during the experiments. Fifty millilitre of deionized water was spiked with 133Ba (~ 70 Bq), and the pH (from 1 to 10) was adjusted with 1 mol L−1 HCl or 1 mol L−1 NaOH and checked with the pH meter CyberScan pH/Ion 510. The solution was put in a column (1 cm diameter, filled with 0.5 g impregnated MnO2- SiO2 composite resin BV = 1.5 mL) which had been preconditioned with 30 mL of deionized water at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The effluent was collected into a vial and counted on a gamma detector with an energy line of 133Ba 356 keV.
3.2.2. Optimization of 133Ba(Ra) elution from the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin
A column of 1 cm diameter and BV = 1.5 mL of MnO2–SiO2 composite resin (1 g) with a grain size of 0.5 mm was used. The MnO2– SiO2 column was washed with 25 mL of water at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. For the study of barium (radium) elution, a model solution was prepared. To 50 mL of deionized water, 133Ba tracer was added, and then the pH of the sample was adjusted to (6−7) with a diluted sodium hydroxide solution. This solution was loaded on the MnO2–SiO2 composite resin and the column was washed with 25 mL of deionized water. 133Ba was eluted with hydrochloric acid of different concentrations (from 2 mol L−1 to 4 mol L−1 at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min−1) and nitric acid of different concentrations (from 2 mol L−1 to 4 mol L−1) and with different volumes (from 10 to 50 mL). The effluent was counted on a gamma detector with an energy line of 133Ba 356 keV.
3.2.3. Influence of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ concentration on 133Ba(Ra) adsorption
The MnO2–SiO2 composite resin with a grain size of 0.5 mm was used, the column was conditioned with deionized water. Model samples were prepared. Into 500 mL of drinking water the 133Ba tracer was added and the concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were adjusted to (0.07 – 5.07) g L−1 and (1−400) g L−1 for K+ and Na+. The pH of the sample was adjusted with NaOH to 6–7. The first sample contained the natural Ca2+ concentration of drinking water, 70 mg L−1 (Kvalita vody, 2013). The sample was loaded on the column, washed with 25 mL of deionized water, and the 133Ba was eluted with 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3. The effluent was counted on a gamma detector with an energy line of 133Ba 356 keV.
3.2.4. Procedure for 226Ra determination using the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin
Before the separation of the radium, sample of sparkling water with a volume of 1.5 L was boiled in order to remove the CO2. 65 Bq of 133Ba was added to each analyzed sample as a radium tracer for the yield determination. The pH of the sample was adjusted with NaOH to 6–7. The column (diameter 1 cm) of MnO2–SiO2 composite resin (1 g) (BV= 1.5 mL, grain size = 0.5 mm) was conditioned with 10 mL deionized water at a flow rate of 5 mL min−1. The sample was loaded into a column of MnO2––SiO2 composite resin and washed with 25 mL of deionized water. The radium was eluted from the column with 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3 at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1.
Samples for alpha counting of the radium were prepared according to the procedure described by Maxwell and Culligan (2012). Prior to the alpha counting, the sample was measured on an HPGe detector (ORTEC, 20% of rel. efficiency) to determine the recovery of 133Ba.
The activity of the 226Ra was determined using alpha spectrometry. A two-chamber α - spectrometer 576A equipped with ULTRA™ ion-implanted silicon detectors and with a 600 mm2 active area was used for counting alpha radioactivity. The spectra were processed using the Alpha-Vision™ 32 –bit emulation software from the EG&G ORTEC company.
4. Results and discussions
4.1. Characterization of the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin
In the case of the MELT procedure, the number of lifetime components is selected by the program itself and the distribution of lifetimes is calculated. The mean values of the positron (Ps) lifetimes, as well as their relative intensities (also calculated by the MELT procedure) are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. They show us the o-Ps lifetime distribution in the time range of 1–100 ns in a vacuum for both pure silica gel (SG) and composite resin. For pure silica gel, the presence of 3 different groups of large hole size was recorded with average diameter sizes of 0.98, 1.56 and 3.8 in nm. In the case of the composite resin, we detected (by Ps) only one type of larger holes an average value of hole diameter of 0.72 nm. These values were estimated by the EELViS procedure. A simple spherical model of holes and parameter D = 0.166 nm was used.

Electron microscopy analysis supports well the results obtained by positron annihilation study. Even the resolution of the SEM technique does not allow the direct recognition of the holes detected by PALS. The differences in grain surface nature between SG and SG + MnO2 is evident (Fig. 2). For the SG sample, the grains apparently contain high amounts of free volume, while for the SG + MnO2 sample, the grains seem to be relatively much more compact, so their volume must be effectively filled by an MnO2 additive.

The basic porous silica gel matrix is very well filled by MnO2 molecules. The large pores inside the composite resin were not detected. A small amount of pores with an average of size 0.72 nm (2% of the total annihilation events on the lifetime spectrum) was detected. This contribution most likely comes from the partially filled smaller pores of the basic matrix, although the small contribution from the residual free spaces of filled larger pores (e.g free-volumes between the internal surfaces of matrix and the filler) is not excluded.
4.2. Influence of pH on 133Ba (Ra) sorption on the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin
The effect of pH on 133Ba(226Ra) sorption on the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin was studied (in the pH range of 1–10). The pH range was adjusted by adding either diluted NaOH or diluted HCl. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that the 133Ba(226Ra) sorption increases as the pH increases, with optimum being in the range 3–10. The uptake reduction at pH levels less than 3 can be explained by the mechanism involved in radium uptake. A previous investigation by Eikenberg et al. (2001), and by Karamanis et al. (2006), attributed this reduction to the nature of the manganese oxide surface. MnO2 behaves as a typical cation exchanger and the effect of hard-to-exchange hydrated ions in the interlayer spaces of MnO2 should be the main reason for the radium sorption reduction at lower pH.
Fig. 3. Sorption of 133Ba(226Ra) on the MnO2 - SiO2 composite resin as a function of pH.
Koulouris (1995), investigated the principal sorption characteristics of radium on manganese dioxide. In the pH range of 4–12 no changes in the radium recovery were observed and it maintained a constant level which declined dramatically below pH 4. Koulouris stated this is due to the positive surface charge at low pH and the existence of a zero-point charge corresponding to a certain pH value above which no variation of the adsorption takes place because the surface charge remains negative.
4.3. Optimization of the elution of 133Ba (Ra) from the MnO2–SiO2 composite resin
Elution of 133Ba (Ra) from the column with the MnO2 - SiO2 composite resin, with different volumes and concentration of HNO3, was tested. The results showed 68 ± 7% 133Ba recovery for 2 mol L−1 and 90 ± 8% for 3 mol L−1 HNO3. It was found that 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3 was enough for the elution of 133Ba (Ra) with recoveries higher than 98 ± 5%.
The 133Ba elution profile with 4 mol L−1 HNO3 is presented in Fig. 3. The solution (500 mL deionized water + 70 Bq 133Ba) was put into the MnO2 - SiO2 composite resin column. 133Ba was eluted with 4 mol L−1 HNO3 (60 mL) by 12 × 5 mL aliquots collected and measured separately. The aliquots were measured on the HPGe detector for the 133Ba activity and the elution profile was obtained. 94% of the 133Ba was detected in the first 25 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3. Secondly, elution of the 133Ba (Ra) from the MnO2 - SiO2 composite resin column with different volumes and concentration of HCl was tested. It was found that 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HCl was enough for the desorption of 133Ba (Ra), with recoveries higher than 97 ± 8%, but the elution with HCl caused a partial destruction of the MnO2- SiO2 active component and thus an elevated amount of Mn in the radium fraction compared with the HNO3. The most suitable agent for 133Ba elution was 50 mL of 4 mol L−1 HNO3.
4.4. Influence of stable Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ ions on 133Ba(Ra) recoveries
Common cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ with higher concentrations, could be potential competitor ions during radium separation. The influence of several typical matrix elements (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) on radium uptake onto the MnO2- SiO2 composite resin in water samples was studied.
Ca2+ and Mg2+ had similar behavior; our results showed higher than 98 ± 7% chemical recovery in a fully tested concentration range (from 0.07 to 5.07) g L−1 and 100 ± 7% recovery in a fully tested concentration range for Na+ and K+ (from 1 to 300) g L−1. High salt contents had no influence on 133Ba(Ra) uptake.
Triskem (2012) International provides MnO2 Resin and MnO2 –PAN (composite inorganic ion exchangers with polyacrylonitrile) which allows a fast concentration and separation of radium from large volume water samples in the presence of high amounts of calcium up to 2 g L−1. MnO2 – PAN consists of very fine MnO2 particles and modified polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a binding polymer which creates a very stable MnO2 resin with a very high surface area. The results from electron microscopy analysis confirmed that MnO2- SiO2 composite resin grains seem to be relatively much more compact, so their volume must be effectively filled with MnO2, as with MnO2 – PAN.
Bojanowski et al. (2005) investigated the influence of high salt concentrations on MnO2 coprecipitation efficiency and found that sodium chloride concentrations up to 100 g L−1 do not affect the recovery of barium and radium. The effects of calcium and magnesium ions, which were much stronger at concentrations from 0.2 g L−1 to 1 g L−1 or higher, made a second or third repetition of the precipitation procedure necessary in the filtrate of the foregone precipitation to obtain high recoveries. MnO2 incorporated in SiO2 results in a high surface area and a higher capacity of the MnO2- SiO2 composite resin in comparison to the MnO2 precipitation method.
4.5. Influence of the volume of drinking water on 133Ba(Ra) recoveries
For experiments with MnO2-SiO2 composite resin, different volumes of water samples (0.5 L, 1 L, 3 L, 5 L and 10 L) were used and equal conditions maintained. The approximate flow rates of loading and eluting solutions were 10 mL min−1. Effluent was collected into a vial and counted on an HPGe gamma detector at 133Ba with Eγ = 356 keV. It was found that the radiochemical yields of all the volume samples analyzed were higher than 90 ± 9%, which may be considered as a good separation with a high recovery.
The linearity of the new separation method with the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin was calculated based on the alpha measurement of 226Ra from five 500 mL aliquots of water samples spiked with different amounts of 226Ra standards. The spiked concentrations were selected in order to establish the method's linearity over a range from 0.045 to 0.120 Bq. As shown in Fig. 4, linearity was established over the selected range. In the results of the linear method, the coefficient of the determination, i.e. the regression rabat. shows that 99.9% of points correspond to a straight line and the data fulfill, with a 99.9% probability, a constant scatter. The demonstrated linear model clearly proves that the residua fulfill the Gaussian model, without any autocorrelation or trend. The Fisher-Snedecor F-test leads to the statistical criterion F = 1650 while the quantile  is lower and therefore the model proposed is statistically significant. Regression diagnostics procedures were used for examination of the regression triplet. The statistical methods applied confirmed the agreement for the separation of 226Ra on the new sorbent MnO2-SiO2.

The developed method for the determination of 226Ra using the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin was applied to various types of natural mineral waters from Slovakia and the Czech republic. To monitor the radium chemical yield, water samples were spiked with 133Ba. The recoveries and the activity concentrations of 226Ra in the analyzed water samples are presented in Table 2.

The 133Ba radiochemical yields of the samples analyzed were in the range of 77–96%. The separation of the 226Ra using the MnO2– SiO2 composite resin is a rapid and highly effective method. The total time of the analysis, including the radium separation on the MnO2– SiO2 composite resin and micro-precipitation, was approximately 6 h.
The 226Ra activity concentrations obtained in the analyzed samples were compared with the limit values set in Edict 528 of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic in 2007. The comparison showed that none of the analyzed samples exceeded these limit values. The maximum limit value of 226Ra activity concentration for natural mineral and natural healing water is 1.9 Bq L−1 and for spring and drinking water 0.6 Bq L−1.
The results of the mineral water samples analyzed using MnO2- SiO2 composite resin were compared with the results obtained using separation by the standard method with MnO2-PAN from Eichrom. The statistical comparison of an analytical method can be performed by the application of a rigorous approach to the linear regression using a regression triplet (program QC-EXPERT- Trilobyte, Pardubice, Czech Republic).
Examination of a regression models quality can be considered directly from the regression scatter plot of y vs. x (Meloun, Militký, 2006). Of the seven most efficient diagnostic plots (the Williams graph, graph of predicted residuals, Pregibon graph, Gray L–R graph, index graph of the Atkinson Measurement, index graph of diagonal elements of the matrix, and Rankit Q–Q graph of Jackknife residuals), the Williams graph was selected to give the most reliable detection of outliers. The results of the regression diagnostic and analysis are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 5. The results of the model tested for 226Ra separation show that the section β0 is equal to zero (its interval estimation contains zero). The slope is equal to one because its interval estimation contains the no. one. In the results of the method, the coefficient of determination, i.e. the regression rabat, shows that more than 99% of points correspond to a straight line and the data fulfill, with a 99% probability, a constant scatter. Fig. 5 shows a good correlation between the obtained results. The demonstrated linear model clearly proves that the residua fulfill the Gaussian model, without any autocorrelation or trend. The statistical methods used confirmed the suitability of applying the new MnO2-SiO2 composite for 226Ra separation in mineral water samples.

5. Conclusion
The capability of 226Ra separation and determination in water samples using the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin was demonstrated. The influence of the grain size, eluting agents, elution volumes and interfering ions on radium adsorption from water samples was investigated. The results of the waters analyzed using the MnO2-SiO2 composite resin were compared with the results obtained using separation by the standard Eichrom method with MnO2-PAN resin.
The proposed method was applied to the 226Ra determination in various types of natural mineral, mountain spring, drinking and natural healing waters from Slovakia and Czech Republic. The obtained 226Ra activity in the analyzed samples was compared with the limit values set in Edict 528 of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic in 2007 and no limit was exceeded. The proposed method could be a very cheap alternative to extraction chromatography methods using expensive resins.
