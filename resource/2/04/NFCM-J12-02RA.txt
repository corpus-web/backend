Abstract
Silver nanopowders with specific surface area up to 39.1 cm2/g, as well as alumina powders coated with silver consisting of nanoparticles with sizes of 50 and 80 nm, were produced by a radiation-chemical method. The influence of the number of OH groups of polyhydric alcohols on the specific surface area of obtained silver nanopowders is shown in the first time. The coating area of the oxide base can be varied from 2-3%–40%. Antibacterial properties of the composite have been studied on wine yeast, as well as E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. The results of the study of photocatalytic properties of the composite showed its potential.

1. Introduction
Weakly aggregated nanopowders (NP) are used in microelectronics, electrochemistry, synthesis of optical-electronic sensors, pigments, etc. (Egorova and Revina, 2002).
Particularly important are the bactericidal properties of silver ions, due to which NP can serve as a basis for the creation of new classes of bactericidal compounds, various kinds of substances in medicine and agriculture (Jain and Pradeep, 2005; Morones et al., 2005).
The use of silver nanoparticles in combination with other substances enables to obtain synergetic effect and silver saving, as well as the creation of plasmon mesostructures for photonics (Schuller et al., 2010).
The use of silver-based composites is promising in the treatment of angiogenic diseases, such as cancer (Yuan et al., 2017), in joint endoprosthesis (Hasan et al., 2018), in dental transplantology (Yang et al., 2018), for directed bone tissue regeneration (Jin et al., 2018), as a photocatalytic agent for water disinfection (Tanori et al., 2018; Mendez-Preiffer et al., 2019), as well as in targeted drug delivery (Brown et al., 2013).
Therefore, the development of new methods of producing silver and composites based on them is relevant both for the creation of new materials for the treatment of various diseases and pathologies, and for the development of biotechnologies.
Currently, the main methods for producing silver NP and their aqueous suspensions are chemical. Of these methods, reduction of silver particles from aqueous solutions of its salts in the presence of various stabilizers (Vegera and Zimon, 2006; Song et al., 2004; Chou et al., 2005) has become most common. The reducing agents used are hydrogen and hydrogen-containing compounds: tetrahydroborates (Vegera and Zimon, 2006) and alkali metal citrates (Lu et al., 2006a), hypophosphites, alcohols (Sondi et al., 2003), as well as organometallic compounds (Wand et al., 2006). Reduction of AgNPs can occur both on the surface of previously synthesized latex microspheres in the presence of a reducing agent (Yasnaya et al., 2007) and in the polymerization step of monomers (Pileni, 2000).
Physical methods for producing silver NP (AgNP) include spraying or mechanical grinding of bulk matter (Oates TMucklich A, 2005; Lu et al., 2006b), photo recovery of silver salts (Sudeep and Kamat, 2005) by laser ablation of solid bodies in liquids (Simakin et al., 2004), the use of electron beam of both microsecond (Bogle et al., 2006) and nanosecond duration (Sokovnin and Balezin, 2012; Balezin et al., 2011).
In recent years, biological (green) methods of NP synthesis have been increasingly used. These include using egg white (Lu et al., 2012), water extract of fruit seeds (Syzygiumcumini) (Das et al., 2019), outer peel of vegetables (food waste) - Korean red sweet potatoes and Korean pumpkin sweet potatoes (Habibipour et al., 2019), black pomegranate peel, curcumin derivative (Murugesan et al., 2019). Methods based on bacteria and algae (Ahmad et al., 2019), plants based on mangrove trees (Zhang et al., 2019) or using a specific fungus from traditional Chinese medicine (Wen et al., 2016).
The disadvantages of chemical and biological methods include the effect of the concentration of the initial components on the reaction, as well as the after-effect of particle coagulation in solution. In physical methods, coagulation can be suppressed by the addition of surfactants.
Of all the physical methods, the use of an electron beam is most interesting, since it has been found that with a relatively small electron fluence of microsecond duration (2 × 1013-3*1015 pcs/cm2) it is possible to produce AgNP of 10–60 nm (Bogle et al., 2006). At the same time, an increase in electron fluence leads to a decrease in the size of the AgNPs, unlike in chemical methods, where an increase in reaction time leads to an increase in particle size.
The use of nanosecond repetitive accelerators (Kotov et al., 2000) allows to easily control the effect on the reaction components by selecting the repetition rate of the accelerator operation. The conducted experiments revealed (Bogle et al., 2006) that it is possible to obtain weakly agglomerated silver NP of 3–5 nm size with nanosecond electron beam (NEB) irradiation of silver nitrate solution in toluene with ethylene glycol and of 30–50 nm size in water.
It has been determined that there is an optimal contribution of NEB energy to the solution, and it has also been found that an increase in the absorbed dose leads not to an increase in the reaction yield (AgNP), but to an increase in the degree of agglomeration of the produced powders by the formation of adhesions between the particles.
On this basis it was concluded that silver ions, after reduction to atoms by the products of alcohol radiolysis occurring during the period of exposure to the NEB pulse, are combined into clusters in pauses between pulses, which then grow in size to NPs (the mechanism is described in (Bogle et al., 2006)). In the process of further irradiation, the NPs are combined into agglomerates. The main difference between this process and that described in (Bogle et al., 2006) is that although the dose rates for irradiation are close (~MGy/s), the energy of the NEB is released over a time of ~ 50 ns, i.e. the times of electron irradiation processes differ by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, inhibition of the growth of NPs in pauses between pulses (~ 100 ms) by the OH* radicals, as described in (Bogle et al., 2006), does not occur - the life time of radicals (~ 100 ns) is clearly lacking.
Note that the presence of toluene and ethylene glycol precursor in the solution significantly complicates the release of nanopowders from the solution, due to both their oiliness and toxicity. Fundamentals of radiochemical technology of receiving AgNPs of 220–570 nm in size (SBET = 0.9 ÷ 2.6 of sq. m/g) from silver nitrate solutions in isopropyl alcohol were as a result developed at the energy consumption of 0.164 ÷ 2.5 W/g (Balezin et al., 2011).
The AgNPs obtained from solutions with polyhydric alcohol (ethylene glycol) were found to be smaller than those obtained from solutions with monohydric (isopropyl) alcohol. Further studies have shown the possibility of obtaining smaller powders, where the mechanism for inhibiting the growth of silver clusters was not based on OH* radicals, as in (Bogle et al., 2006), but on the OH groups of polyhydric alcohols.
Thus, the radiochemical technology on the basis the NEB shows potential to allow obtaining NPs ≤5 nm, including for receiving nanodimensional silver coverings on an oxidic basis.
The purpose of this work was to determine the conditions for the production of AgNPs, as well as to produce oxide-based nanoscale silver coating composites using radiation-chemical technology.
2. Experiment technique
2.1. Production of silver nanopowders in polyhydric alcohols
The composition of the solutions for irradiation is shown in Table 1, wherein the concentration of polyhydric alcohols was limited by their solubility in water at room temperature. The choice of the composition of the irradiated solution was related both to the presence of different numbers of OH groups and to their safety for humans.
Table 1. The composition of the solutions for irradiation.
Solvent	Number of OH group	Solution components
Isopropyl alcohol	1	5 ml distilled water
0.6 g AgNO3
Isopropyl alcohol to 100 ml solution
Glycerin	3	50 ml glycerin
100 ml distilled water
0.6 g AgNO3
Xylitol	5	50 g xylitol
100 ml distilled water
0.6 g AgNO3
Sorbitol	6	69 g sorbitol
100 ml distilled water
0.6 g AgNO3
Irradiation of NEB solutions was carried out on the URT-0.5 accelerator (0.5 MeV, 50 ns, 1 kW (Kotov et al., 2000)) at different repetition rates, in accordance with the experimental conditions (Balezin et al., 2011) (Table 2). The irradiation was carried out in Petri dishes, each filled with 25 ml of the solution, the thickness of the layer being about 1 mm, which ensured the complete absorption of the electron beam. The distance from the accelerator outlet was ~ 5 cm. The absorbed dose on the surface of the solution was measured by a film dosimeter CO PD (F) Р-5/50 (Abdulov et al., 2002).
Table 2. The conditions and results of the experiments for producing AgNP.
Accelerator repetition rate, pps	Absorbed dose D, kGy	Specific surface SBET, m2/g

20	15	0,99	5,29	13,7	6,76
50	37,4	0,83	–	7,05	2,99
After irradiation, the powder was sedimented for 24 h. The solution was then transferred into another container by a syringe for further irradiation, the concentration of AgNO3 adjusted to the original in the solution. The concentrated suspension precipitate was dried and the powder collected and the alcohol vapor was saved for reuse. The resulting powder was washed in distilled water (~ 1 g per 300 ml). After sedimentation for 24 h, the water was drained to a powder precipitate level (2–3 mm) and a new portion of water was added. The cycle was repeated 5 times, after which the settled powder was dried and collected [37].
The measurement of the specific surface area (SBET) of the produced powders was carried out by the BET method on a TriStar 3000 V6.03 analyzer. The elemental composition of the powders was determined by the energy dispersion analysis (EDX) method, and the structure and morphology of the samples were examined by scanning microscopy on LEO 982 microscopes equipped with Oxford instruments X-Max and TESCAN LYRA3. The conditions and results of the experiments are shown in Table 2.
From the data shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1, it can be seen that irradiation in xylitol solution results in a substantial increase (15 times) in SBET of the produced powders. For sorbitol, there is a more complex trend - there is an increase in SBET of the AgNPs at a small repetition rate of accelerator operation (3.3 and 20 pps), and when it increases to 50 pps there is a sharp decrease in surface area, although SBET remains many times more than for isopropyl alcohol.

In addition, the XRD analysis found that the powder obtained in isopropyl alcohol contains two different fractions of Ag and AgNO3, i.e. residues of precursor were found (Balezin et al., 2011).
2.2. Production of composite nanopowders
A suspension based on sorbitol solution was used to produce composite nanopowders (Table 1). The resulting suspension was irradiated in Petri dishes. The absorbed dose was 37.4 kGy on the surface of the suspension, 37 pulses were applied to dial the dose in a single accelerator mode of operation. The irradiated suspension was held for 15 and 96 h, the composites isolated (as described above for AgNPs) are hereinafter referred to as Al2O3Ag15 and Al2O3Ag96, respectively. SEM photos of the produced composites are given in Fig. 2, results of EDX analysis in Table 3.

According to the microscopic analysis, the size of the NPs was ~ 50 nm for Al2O3Ag15, ~ 80 nm for Al2O3Ag96. The particle size calculation was averaged over several dozen measurements. Moreover, the SEM photo of the NP allows to visually assess the degree of coating of alumina oxide with silver. From Fig. 1 can be seen that some areas of the substrate were tightly coated with silver covering almost the entire surface, and fragmentation of the coating was observed in other areas. In both cases, silver forms agglomerates on the alumina surface, which in turn are in two states: distributed by fragments and a thin layer or sealed and completely enveloping the alumina surface.
2.3. Specifying properties of composite nanopowders
The production of composites was complicated by the fact that the alumina was insoluble in water and distributed in the suspension non-uniformly. In order to obtain a more uniform coating, the suspension must be stable for 24 h in order to be able to separate the NP into different fractions. Suspension stability is characterized by sedimentation stability, which is directly proportional to optical density. Two kinds of stabilizers were used to increase the sedimentation stability of the suspension: electrostatic sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7) and steric polyethylene glycol (PEG, C2nH4n+2On+1).
The stability of the suspension was evaluated spectrophotometrically by the Ecros PE-5400UV spectrophotometer. Solutions without stabilizer and with the addition of a stabilizer at a concentration of 1:1 with silver contained in the silver nitrate were prepared for the study. Each suspension was sonicated at the PSB-Gals unit at a frequency of 22 kHz for 40 min, and sedimentation stability was evaluated 3 times, immediately after exposure to the ultrasound (US), 60 min and a day later.
The chemical composition of the suspension after exposure to the US was determined by rhodanometry (Korostelev, 1997). The suspension was previously centrifuged on a High-speed centrifuge CN-10001 for 15 min at 2000 rpm and a 2 ml aliquot was taken of each solution. To determine the Ag content, 1 ml of a saturated solution of iron-ammonium alum was added to all solutions as an indicator and titrated with a prepared solution of potassium rhodanide (KSCN, molar concentration 4.3 mmol) until an unchanging red dish color appeared.
Two methods were used to study antibacterial properties of composite NP: cell counting using the Goryaev chamber and the disco-diffusion method.
Wine yeast was used as cell cultures for the first method. The cell suspension consisted of 80 ml warm water (40–50 °C), 3.33 g sugar and 0.16 g yeast. After the suspension was prepared, it was incubated for 20 h to allow the yeast to enter the stationary growth phase. The cell culture was spread into 5 plates with a diameter of 40 mm, 10 ml of suspension in each.
In each series of experiments, one of the plates was a control group, and 1 mg and 2 mg of NPs Al2O3, Ag, Al2O3Ag96 and Al2O3Ag15 were added to each of the remaining plates in the first and second series of experiments, respectively. The amount of NPs at the bottom of each plate was 100 μg/cm2 for the first series of experiments and 200 μg/cm2 for the second series.
Antibacterial capacity was assessed by counting with the Goryaev chamber and light microscopy of live (unstained) and dead (stained) wine yeast cells 24, 48 and 72 h after the addition of NP.
The antibacterial properties of NP according to the second method were tested against Gram-negative bacteria - Escherichia coli and Gram-positive - Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus are markers of biological pollution in the environment, moreover, Staphylococcus belongs to a group of sanitary indicator microorganisms.
Seeding of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus strains was carried out on meat-peptone agar. Samples were applied to the surface of the medium at the center of each sector. In total there were 4 tests to which were added: 1 - alumina, 2 - silver, 3 - a composite (Al2O3Ag96) and 4 - control. The microorganisms were then thermostated according to the standard procedure at 37 °C for 48 h, the growth of the colonies of the microorganisms around the nanopowder samples was then visually evaluated.
The method of evaluating the photocatalytic properties of composite powders consisted in the following: methyl violet (MV) dye was dissolved in distilled water, after which the solution was irradiated with radiation in the range of 315–800 nm from the DRW UV lamp with and without the nanoparticles.
Six ml of MV solution was added into each of the 4 plates of 40 mm diameter, one of which was control, and the remaining two had 300 μl (1 series) or 500 μl (2 series) of pre-prepared suspensions of NP Al2O3, Ag and Al2O3Ag96 added to them. In the first series of experiments, the concentration of NPs in the plate was 100 μg/ml and in the second, 480 μg/ml. To measure optical density, a 4 ml aliquot of each solution was taken into a quartz cuvette and placed in an Ecros PE-5400UV spectrophotometer. In order to determine the discoloration rate of the solution, measurements were made before UV exposure and 4 more times every 5 min after irradiation.
2.4. Methodic of composite coating area calculation
For the resulting composites, the ratio of base (alumina) to silver (Fig. 3) was calculated based on EDX analysis data (Table 3). The calculation procedure is presented below, the results of calculations for different variants (particle diameters) are summarized in Table 4.

Based on known ratios.
(1)V1 =4/3*π *R13
(2)S1 = 4*π *R12
So it is possible to write:
(3)V1 = 1/3*π *S1*R1
(4)m1 =ρ1*V1 = 1/3*π *S1*R1*ρ1
Using the ratio of the area of Ag to the Al2O3, the ratio for the weight of the nanosilver expressed through the square of the alumina was obtained.
(5)m2 =ρ2*V2 = S2*R2*ρ2 =S1*k1*R2*ρ2
whereV1, R1, S1, m1, ρ1– volume, radius, square, mass and density of NPs alumina, V2, R2, S2, m2, ρ2 – volume, layer thickness, square, mass and density of AgNPs, k1 – square ratio Ag to Al2O3 (or surface covering degree of NPs base by silver):
(6)m1 =k2* m2
where k2 – mass ratio Al2O3 and Ag from EDX analysis.
By substituting (4) and (5) in (6), we obtain formulas for the ratio of silver and oxide masses:
(7)1/3*S1*R1* ρ1=k2 * S1*k1*R2*ρ2
(8)k1 =1/3* (R1*ρ1) / (k2 * R2*ρ2)
The results of the mass measurements of O, Al, and Ag from Table 3 were used to calculate the weight ratio of Al2O3/Ag, layer thickness, and the average particle size of silver and alumina (varying the particle diameter of the base and coating), using (5), (6), (7), (8).
The results of the calculation are shown in Table 5, from which it can be seen that the silver coating ratio for the Al2O3Ag96 powder was 16–40%, for the Al2O3Ag15 - 2–3%. The different proportion of silver coating was due to the different amount of silver deposited on the alumina and depended on the holding time of the suspension after irradiation.

The Ag layer thickness, nm	100–200	350–550
The proportion of the silver coating, %	16–40	2–3
3. Discussion of the results
3.1. Research of suspension stability
Measurements of the optical density of the suspensions (D) showed that the sedimentation rate of the NP was significantly reduced when the catalyst was added (Fig. 4). Thus, 15 min after US exposure, the D reduction was 8% for the control sample and for the suspensions with PEG and sodium citrate it was 1 and 0%, respectively. Furthermore, the study of optical density after 24 h showed that during the day the powder sedimentation was 99.9%, 76% and 86%, respectively.
Fig. 4. Sedimentation stability of suspensions.
Consequently, it is necessary to continue searching for a stabilizer for the suspension in order to be able to obtain a more uniform silver coating in a 4 day stand-up deposition mode.
In addition, when treated with ultrasound, each suspension changed color: the control sample and the suspension with the addition of PEG became grey-brown, and the suspension with sodium citrate - mustard color. Concentration of silver ions Ag+ was determined by rhodanometry (Korostelev, 1997), which is based on the following analytical chemical reaction:
KSCN + AgNO3 = ↓AgSCN + KNO3
After titration, each solution acquired a reddish tint. The titration results are summarized in Table 6.
Table 6. Chemical composition.
Suspension	Titrant volume, ml	Concentration of Ag ions, mol/l	Share of non-metallic Ag, at. %
Control probe without ultrasound	14.0	29.9	100.0
Control probe with ultrasound	13.2	28.2	94.3
Sodium citrate with ultrasound	5.8	12.4	41.4
PEG with ultrasound	12.8	27.4	91.5
From the data of Table 6, it can be seen that when a stabilizer such as sodium citrate was added, more than half of Ag+ precipitated in the form of metallic silver when treated with US. However, less than 6% and 10% of (atomic) metallized silver was formed in the control suspension and the PEG-added suspension respectively after exposure to ultrasound. These results indicate that of the selected stabilizers, sodium citrate interacts more actively with silver nitrate compared to PEG. The appearance of different colors can be explained by the different particle sizes produced during the reaction.
3.2. Research of antibacterial properties
From the obtained data (Table 7) it appears that antibacterial properties of composite NP tested with the help of Goryaev chamber on yeast exceed properties of Al2O3 base powder by 17 and 18%, AgNP by 24 and 40% at concentration of 100 and 200 μg/cm2, respectively. The larger composite (Al2O3Ag96) has greater biological activity compared to finer composite (Al2O3Ag15). Based on calculations, the suspension with the large living cell composition averaged 2.2 times less (48–61%) for all three days than the control sample; while in the fine composite suspension, the first two days of the cells averaged about 1.8 times less (~ 44%), and on the third day, the number of live cells was greater than in the control sample.

By examining composite Al2O3Ag96 (Table 7), it was found that antibacterial properties depend on concentration in a complex way: at a concentration of 100 μg/cm2, biological efficiency decreased with an increase in exposure time, and at the concentration of 200 μg/cm2, on the contrary, antibacterial effect increased with an increase in exposure duration. It should be noted that no studies were conducted for composite Al2O3Ag15 at the concentration of 200 μg/cm2 (Table 7).
The assessment of antibacterial ability of the NP based on the basis of disc diffusion method found that no bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects were detected for the sample No. 1 (Al2O3), while weak activity was recorded for the samples No. 2 (Ag) and No. 3 (Al2O3Ag96) in relation to the Escherichia coli bacterium and Staphylococcus. The result requires closer verification.
3.3. Examination of photocatalytic properties of composite NP
The results of experiments performed to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of powders that were carried out at different concentrations are shown in Table 8.

The photodegradation of the MV from the time of exposure to UV can be described by a linear equation: y = kx + b in which the coefficient k characterizes the rate of photodestruction of the solution.
From the experimental results, the threshold effect of powder concentration on the rate of the investigated reaction was established.
At the concentration of 100 μg/ml, the photodestruction rate of all the powder samples was less than that of the control sample (Table 8). Therefore, at this concentration, the NPs act as photoprotectors, with the composite (Al2O3Ag96) showing the smallest photoprotective properties.
At the concentration of 480 μg/ml, on the contrary, the photodestructionrate of all powder samples was greater than in the control sample (Table 8). Consequently, at the concentration of 480 μg/ml, the NP exhibited photocatalytic properties, with the composite (Al2O3Ag96) being most effective. Thus, the composite NP is promising for investigation as a photocatalytic material and requires further research.
4. Conclusion
AgNP with specific surface area up to 39.1 cm2/g were produced by the radiation-chemical method.
The significant influence of the number of hydroxyl groups in polyhydric alcohols of lysis solution on the specific surface area of obtained powders was established for the first time.
Innovative radiation-chemical technology of the application of silver nanocoating on oxide base was developed, its high efficiency was established. The possibility of controlling the deposition process and the degree of silver coating on the surface of NP alumina was shown to be achievable by changing the deposition time.
Composite NP of alumina coated with nano-sized layer of silver with thickness of 50 and 80 nm was obtained at the coating degree of 16–40% and 2–3%, respectively.
When examining the stabilization properties of the NP before irradiation, the use of stabilizers such as sodium citrate and PEG was limited, and it was necessary to further search for a stabilizing substance in order to be able to obtain a more uniform coating of the base with silver at a long deposition time.
Antibacterial ability of composite was studied on yeast, Escherichia coli bacterium and Staphylococcus, efficiency against these strains was shown.
Photocatalytic properties of Al2O3Ag96 powder were tested, which showed the prospects of using the composite as a photocatalyst.
The advantage of this method of producing silver-based composites is the possibility of their controlled production (with respect to the degree of coating) on the basis of other oxides and other compounds, which opens up a wide range of ways of obtaining the required materials for different applications in medicine and pharmaceuticals.
