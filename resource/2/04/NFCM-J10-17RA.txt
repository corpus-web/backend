Abstract
Sodium lauryl sulfate-loaded polyacrylonitrile (SLSLPAN) was synthesized in the present investigation using an in-situ one step process through gamma radiation-induced polymerization. The structure, composition, surface area and pore size and volume of the employed adsorbent were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. Adsorption of radioactive strontium(II) onto SLSLPAN was studied in the pH range 3–13. Batch kinetic data showed that the equilibrium was attained at 840 min and the pseudo-first-order was the best kinetic model for describing the kinetic data of the present adsorption process. The diffusion of strontium(II) into SLSLPAN was deeply studied using four diffusion models, namely, Bangham, Boyd, Weber-Morris and Mathewas-Weber models. Two-parameter (Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin) and three-parameter (Redlich-Peterson, Toth and Generalized) isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption equilibrium data of strontium(II) onto SLSLPAN. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the Generalized isotherm model is found to be 0.391 mmol strontium(II) per gram of SLSLPAN. The estimated mean free energy (E = 2.151 kJ/mol) indicated that strontium(II) radionuclides were physically adsorbed onto SLSLPAN. The value of enthalpy change (ΔHo = 35.325 kJ/mol) and those of free energy change (ΔGo = −15.278, −16.948, −18.619 and −20.288 at 303, 313, 323 and 333 K, respectively) confirmed that adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides on SLSLPAN was endothermic and spontaneous process.

1. Introduction
Radioactive strontium(II) isotopes, strontium-90 and strontium-89 with half-lives of 28.8 years and 50.5 days, respectively, are among the most hazardous and abundant radionuclides in radioactive liquid wastes in nuclear facilities. This is due to their relatively high yield during uranium fission, long half-lives, biological toxicity, high mobility in aqueous environments, high specific radioactivity and high water solubility. The two later ones are responsible for reaching of radioactive strontium isotopes to underground waters, seawaters and rivers. The intake of strontium-contaminated food or water leads to replacement of calcium in bones with strontium, because of their chemical similarity, which leading to various diseases to individuals (Xia et al., 2019; Mironyuk et al., 2019). Accordingly, it is of great significance to remove radioactive strontium(II) isotopes from radioactive liquid wastes before their release in to the environment.
For treatment of radioactive liquid wastes, several physicochemical techniques have been developed such as (co)precipitation (Tokunaga et al., 2018; Osmanlioglu, 2018), adsorption (Kim et al., 2019a,b; Li et al., 2019), fotation (Rashad et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), coagulation-flocculation (Kim et al., 2019a), membrane separation (Sinharoy et al., 2018) and solvent extraction (Sharma et al., 2019). It is recognized that these technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages, but adsorption process is considered one of the simple and appropriate methods for removal of radioactive isotopes from liquid wastes. For adsorption process, it is found that diverse materials such as clay minerals (Kautenburger et al., 2019), carbon-based materials (Deb et al., 2018), metal (hydr)oxides (Soliman et al., 2019), biomaterials (Mahindrakar and Rathod, 2018), ion-exchangers (Soliman et al., 2016) and industrial wastes (Jelic et al., 2017) have been utilized as solid-phase extractors for radioactive nuclides. Nevertheless, the development of safe, economic and effective materials for removal of radioactive nuclides from aqueous solution is still essential. Recently, a considerable attention has been paid for polyacrylonitrile, PAN, owing to its high chemical, thermal and mechanical stabilities (Mahmoud et al., 2015). But, this material could not be applied as adsorbent unless its nitrile groups are converted into other active functional groups such as carboxylic, amino and hydroxyl groups. This conversion is conducted by the reaction of PAN's nitrile groups with various reagents such as hydroxylamine (Horzum et al., 2012), sodium hydroxide (Bhunia et al., 2018), hydrazine (Saeed et al., 2011), thiosemicarbazide (Deng et al., 2016) and diethylenetriamine (Kampalanonwat and Supaphol, 2014; Kiani et al., 2011). This conventional conversion of PAN's nitrile groups has the disadvantages of high-cost, time consuming as well as difficulties and complexity of experimental procedures (Mahmoud et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2003). Therefore, the search for an alternative simple and effectiveness functionalization method is still in progress. Negatively charged PAN particles, owing to the occurrence of a sodium lauryl sulfate coat on them, were synthesized in the present study which is independent of PAN's nitrile groups.
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3Na, is an anionic surfactant that consists of a hydrophobic part (hydrocarbon chain) and a hydrophilic one (sulfonate group). This type of surfactant is used owing to its availability and low-cost. Generally, at concentrations higher than their critical micelle concentration surfactants tend to aggregate in aqueous solutions forming micelles. One of the important properties of surfactants that is directly related to micelle formation is solubilization (Rosen et al., 2004). The importance of this phenomenon, from the practical point of view, is that it makes possible the dissolving of substances in solvents in which they are normally insoluble. Based on this phenomenon the adsorbent employed in this study, sodium lauryl sulfate-loaded polyacrylonitrile (SLSLPAN), was synthesized. The solubilizate, acrylonitrile (AN) molecules, which are insoluble in aqueous media, are easily dissolved in the hydrophobic environment at the interior of SLS micelles whereas the outer of the micellar structure contains the sulfonate groups. Gamma radiation-induced polymerization of this micellar aqueous solution produced polyacrylonitrile particles loaded with SLS that created a negatively charged surface due to the occurrence of the surfactant's sulfonate groups.
The objective of the current investigation was to transform the non-adsorbent polyacrylonitrile particles into negatively charged particles, sodium lauryl sulfate-loaded polyacrylonitrile (SLSLPAN), for studying the adsorption behavior of radioactive strontium-89 isotope from aqueous solutions. The synthesis process of SLSLPAN was carried out by gamma ray induced polymerization of acrylonitrile molecules solubilized in micellar aqueous solution of SLS anionic surfactant. The effectiveness of the simply synthesized SLSLPAN particles for removal of strontium-89 was evaluated via conducting the adsorption experiments at different operating parameters. Several kinetic and isotherm models were applied for describing the kinetic and isotherm data, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Acrylonitrile (AN, 99% purity) was provided by Cambrian Chemicals. The surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS, 99% purity), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, was employed as a loading agent during synthesis of SLS-loaded PAN. Strontium chloride anhydrous (SrCl2, 99.99% purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The radioactive strontium-89 isotope, obtained by dissolving the irradiated strontium chloride at the Egypt Second Research Reactor in distilled water, was used as a radiotracer for strontium(II) solutions during the adsorption experiments. Sodium chloride (NaCl, Merck) was used for evaluating the influence of the ionic strength on the present adsorption process. The pH of the solutions was adjusted using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) purchased from Merck. All reagents were qualified as chemically pure and their working solutions utilized throughout the experimental work of this study were prepared in distilled water.
2.2. Synthesis of PAN and SLSLPAN
Sodium lauryl sulfate-loaded polyacrylonitrile, SLSLPAN, was synthesized by gamma radiation-induced polymerization process according the experimental procedures shown by the schematic illustration of Fig. 1. Briefly, 20 mL acrylonitrile (AN) were added to 80 mL sodium lauryl sulfate solution (SLS, 0.05 mol/L) in a 200 mL glass reagent bottle. The bottle was closed tightly and vigorously shaked at 300 rpm (using Stuart SBS40 orbital shaker, UK) for 120 min. The bottle was then exposed to a gamma-rays source, cobalt-60, at a constant dose rate of 3 kGy/h for 10 h. After irradiation, the obtained polymeric solid phase (denoted SLSLPAN) was collected and washed with acetone followed by ethanol and finally with distilled water to remove the residual components. Thereafter, the solid phase was dried in an oven overnight at 70 °C. The surfactant-free PAN was synthesized using the same procedures, but in absence of SLS.

Afterwards, the obtained materials were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The FT-IR spectra of PAN and SLSLPAN were obtained by a Nicolet iS10-FTIR spectrometer (USA) using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The XRD patterns of PAN and the SLS-loaded one were recorded on a Philips PW1830 diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source. The surface area, total pore volume and average pore radius of SLSLPAN was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption using a Nova StationA (Quantachrom instruments, USA).
2.3. Adsorption procedures
The effect of contact time on the removal efficiency of 0.25 mmol/L strontium(II) was investigated by mixing, in 25 mL glass bottles, 5 mL adsorbate solution spiked with strontium-89 radioisotope of pH 11.5 with 0.03 g SLSLPAN for different time intervals (10–1440 min). To test the effect of the solution pH on the present adsorption process, the strontium solutions spiked with its radioisotope (5 mL for each experiment, 0.25 mmol/L) were adjusted to different pH values in the range 3–13. An adsorbent dose of 0.03 g was utilized and the suspensions were equilibrated for 24 h. In order to determine the appropriate adsorbent dose for efficient removal of the concerned radionuclide, SLSLPAN at different doses (0.005–0.06 g) was added to strontium(II) solution (5 mL, 0.25 mmol/L, pH 11.5) and the suspensions were equilibrated for 24 h. The influence of temperature was investigated by contacting 5 mL strontium(II) solution (2.85 mmol/L, pH 11.5) with 0.03 g SLSPAN for 24 h at different temperatures (30–60 °C). Adsorption isotherm of the studied radionuclide was determined by immersing 0.03 g SLSPAN in 5 mL Strontium(II) solutions of varying concentrations (0.11–6.85 mmol/L), adjusted at pH 11.5, for 24 h at 30 °C. To evaluate the impact of ionic strength, SLSPAN was added to 0.25 mmol/L strontium(II) solutions of different NaCl concentrations (0.0001–0.5 mol/L). The pH of the solution, adsorbent dose and equilibrium time were kept constant at 11.5, 0.03 g and 24 h, respectively.
At the termination of each experiment, the solid phase was separated by centrifugation for radiometric measurement of the remaining strontium-89 radioactivity in the liquid phase. Based on the difference between its initial radioactivity (Ao) and the final one (Af), the adsorption results of strontium(II) radionuclides were presented as removal efficiency (%) which is calculated using the following relation:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
3.1.1. FT-TR
The FT-IR spectra of PAN and the loaded one, SLSLPAN, are represented in Fig. 2A. This figure indicates that SDS-loaded PAN had the same absorption bands of PAN with additional peaks at 1250 and 1069 cm−1. The presence of physically adsorbed water molecules is detected by the stretching vibration of OH observed at 3591 cm−1 and the bending vibration of HOH that appeared at 1638 cm−1 (Soliman et al., 2019). The strong absorption bands found at 2940 and 2867 cm−1 are ascribed to C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH2 groups (of PAN and SDS hydrocarbon chain), respectively. The C–H bending vibrations of these groups are found at 1448 and 1358 cm−1 (Mahmoud et al., 2015). The sharp absorption band at 2244 cm−1 is assigned to CN stretching vibration of PAN (Mahmoud et al., 2015). The additional peaks observed at 1250 and 1069 cm−1 for SLSLPAN are attributed to the stretching vibrations of Sdouble bondO of the surfactant SDS (Mahmoud et al., 2017). Based on these bands, it can be deduced that PAN is successfully loaded with the anionic surfactant.

3.1.2. XRD
The XRD patterns of PAN and SLSLPAN are shown in Fig. 2B. This figure clarifies that the XRD pattern of PAN agrees well with those previously reported in literature (Nilchi et al., 2011; Saberi et al., 2010). This pattern shows that PAN exhibited no diffraction peaks, suggesting that polyacrylonitrile had an amorphous structure. While, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 16.77° and 28.27° observed for SLSLPAN indicating its crystalline structure.
3.1.3. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption of SDS-loaded polyacrylonitrile and the obtained values of surface area, total pore volume and average pore radius are demonstrated in Fig. 2C. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, SLSLPAN's isotherm represented in this figure is of type II (Sing et al., 1985). This finding reveals that SLSLPAN is a macroporous material. The data given in Fig. 2C show that the employed material possesses surface area, total pore volume and average pore radius values of 163 m2/g, 0.29 cm3/g and 28.23 nm, respectively.
3.2. Effect of contact time, modeling of kinetic data and rate-limiting
The influence of contact time on the removal efficiency of 0.25 mmol/L strontium(II) by adsorption on 6 g/L SLS-loaded PAN is investigated at pH 11.5 and the data obtained are shown in Fig. 3. This figure indicates that the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides is increased by increasing the contact time and maximum value of about 98% is attained at 840 min. Further increase in the contact time had no measurable effect on the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides. To ensure equilibration, the suspensions (mixtures of SLSLPAN and strontium(II) solution) were contacted for 24h during performing the adsorption experiments of the current investigation.
Fig. 3. Variation of the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides using SLSLPAN with time.strontium(II) concentration = 0.25 mmol/L; SLSLPAN dose = 6 g/L; pH 11.5; temperature = 30 °C.
Four commonly adsorption kinetic models are used to analyze the kinetic data of Strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLS-loaded PAN. These models are pseudo-first-order (Eq. (4)), pseudo-second-order (Eq. (5)), modified-second-order (Eq. (6)) and Elovich (Eq. (7)), which are expressed by the following non-linear equations (Largitte and Pasquier, 2016; Tosun, 2012):
@(4)
@(5)

@(7)
where t is the contact time (min), qt is the amount of strontium(II) adsorbed onto the solid phase at contact time t (mmol/g) and qe is the amount of strontium(II) adsorbed onto the solid phase at equilibrium (mmol/g). The parameters K1 (min−1), K2 (g/mmol min), K3 (min−1) and α (mmol/g min) are the adsorption rate constants of the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, modified second-order and Elovich kinetic models, respectively, while the parameter β (g/mmol) is related to the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption. These kinetic parameters are determined by modeling the experimental adsorption kinetic data of strontium(II) radionuclides on SLSLPAN, using the non-linear analysis method using OriginPro 8.5 software, to the abovementioned kinetic models (Eq. (4)–7). The determination of kinetic parameters for adsorption process of an adsorbate onto an adsorbent is significant. This is because it permits to optimize the adsorption mechanism pathways and to design appropriate adsorption treatment plant (Ho and McKay, 1999). The obtained adsorption kinetic parameters for the present adsorption process are given in Table 1. The fitness of the studied models to the experimental data is evaluated by comparing the correlation coefficient (R2) values tabulated in this table. Regarding these values, it can be noticed that the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models fitted the experimental data (R2 > 0.98) better than the modified second-order (R2 = 0.8472) and the Elovich (R2 = 0.9741) models. Since the predicted qe value of the pseudo-first-order model (qe = 0.0423 mmol/g) is much closer to the experimental value (qe-Experimental = 0.0374 mmol/g) than that of the pseudo-second-order model (qe = 0.0581 mmol/g), it can be concluded that the pseudo-first order is the best kinetic model to represent the experimental adsorption kinetic data of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN.

qe (mmol/g) = 0.0423	qe (mmol/g) = 0.0581
R2 = 0.9863	R2 = 0.9804

B = 1.028	R2 = 0.9741
R2 = 0.8474
qe-Experimental (mmol/g) = 0.0374
3.2.1. Rate-limiting
It is well-recognized that solid-liquid adsorption process by the batch equilibration method proceeds via three steps: (i) the external mass transfer of the adsorbate from the bulk solution to the external surface of the adsorbent, (ii) the internal diffusion of the adsorbate to the adsorption sites, and (iii) the equilibrium adsorption (Largitte and Pasquier, 2016). To elucidate whether the external mass transfer (film diffusion) or the internal diffusion (pore diffusion) is the rate-limiting step during adsorption process of Strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN, two pore diffusion models, namely, Weber-Morris model (Eq. (8)) and Bangham model (Eq. (9)) and a film diffusion one (Mathews-Weber model, Eq. (10)) are studied. These models are written as (Mahmoud et al., 2014; Mellouk et al., 2011; Šljivić et al., 2011):
@(8)
@(9)
@(10)
where M and V are previously defined, Co is the initial concentration of Strontium(II) ion (mmol/L), Ct is the concentration of Strontium(II) ion in the liquid phase at time t (mmol/L) and C is the intercept that is related to the thickness of the boundary layer. KM-W (mmol/g min0.5), KBa (L2/g) and KM-W are the rate constants of Weber-Morris, Bangham and Mathews-Weber diffusion models, respectively. These kinetic parameters are determined from the slope and intercept values of the linear plots of qt versus t (Weber-Morris model, Eq. (8)), log[log(Co/(Co – qtM))] versus log t (Bangham model, Eq. (9)) and log(Ct/Co) versus t (Mathews-Weber model, Eq. (10)) as shown in Fig. 4. The calculated parameters along with the correlation coefficient value for each model are given in Table 2. The correlation coefficient values recorded in this table demonstrated that application of Bangham model resulted into a higher value (R2 = 0.9682) than Mathews-Weber model (R2 = 0.9234). This finding pointed out that intraparticle diffusion is the rate-limiting step during the present adsorption process. Fitting the experimental data to the Weber-Morris kinetic model (Eq. (8)) yields a straight line with high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9821) with an intercept very close to zero (C = −0.0039), which further confirmed that intraparticle diffusion is the rate-limiting step in adsorption process of strontium(II) radionuclides onto the synthesized SLS-loaded PAN.

3.3. Effect of SLSLPAN dose on adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides
From the economic and waste management points of view, it is important to determine the lowest adsorbent dose required for achieving efficient removal of the adsorbate. Herein, the influence of SLSLPAN dose on the removal efficiency of 0.25 mmol/L strontium(II) is investigated as demonstrated in Fig. 5. The data presented in this figure shows that SLSLPAN played a significant role in the present adsorption process, where the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides is markedly dependent on the adsorbent dose. By increasing the SLSLPAN dose from 1 g/L to 6 g/L, the removal efficiency is increased from 12.9% to 96.8%. Further increase in the adsorbent dose resulted in a slight increase in the removal percentage and a value of about 99% is obtained at 12 g/L. Increasing the number of adsorption sites at the surface of SLSLPAN can be considered the main reason for improvement of the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides with increasing the adsorbent dose. Since the removal efficiency is slightly increased at SLSLPAN doses higher than 6 g/L, an adsorbent dose of 6 g/L was utilized throughout the experimental work of this study.
Fig. 5. The relationship between SLSLPAN dose and the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides.strontium(II) concentration = 0.25 mmol/L; pH 11.5; temperature = 30 °C; contact time = 24 h.
3.4. Effect of the solution pH on adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides
Fig. 6A compares the removal efficiency percentages of strontium(II) radionuclides using PAN and SLSLPAN adsorbents in the pH range 3–13 at constant adsorbent dose of 6 g/L and 24 h equilibration time. This figure shows that PAN had no affinity toward strontium(II) radionuclides over the studied pH range. This finding is found to agree well with those reported for other species in literature (Mahmoud et al., 2014, 2015). Regarding the data obtained by SLSLPAN, it can be markedly noted that the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides is gradually increased with increasing the solution pH in the range 3–8. Afterwards, the removal efficiency percentage is sharply increased and reached to 94.2% at pH 10. At pHs ≥11, removal percentage more than 97% is achieved.
Fig. 6. Effect of the solution pH on the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides by adsorption on SLSLPAN (A) and aqueous species of strontium (B). Strontium(II) concentration = 0.25 mmol/L; SLSLPAN dose = 6 g/L; contact time = 24 h; temperature = 30 °C.
During synthesis of SLSLPAN adsorbent, sodium lauryl sulfate anionic surfactant was used at concentration of 0.05 mol/L, which is higher than its critical micelle concentration (Rosen et al., 2004). This implies that sodium lauryl sulfate molecules are aggregated in the aqueous solution forming micelles, where the hydrophobic part (hydrocarbon chain) of the surfactant is directed toward the interior of the micelle whilst its hydrophilic part (sulfonate, –OSO3Na, group) is oriented to aqueous solution. Therefore, the addition of acrylonitrile monomers, a water insoluble material, to the sodium lauryl sulfate solution resulted into solubilization of these monomers in the interior of the surfactant micelle, which is one of the important characteristics of surfactants at concentrations ≥ the critical micelle concentration (Rosen et al., 2004). The exposure of this system to gamma-rays giving rise to polymerization of acrylonitrile monomers in the interior of SLS micelles and particles of polyacrylonitrile loaded with SLS, CH3(CH2)11OSO3Na, molecules are formed with negatively charged surface (Fig. 1).
The calculated aqueous species of strontium(II) ion, using PHREEQC Interactive 2.18 software, at different pH values (Fig. 6B) revealed that Sr2+ ion is the predominant species at pH values below 11.5. At higher values, both Sr2+ and SrOH+ species are coexisted in the aqueous solution. Based on these data, the results depicted in Fig. 6A can be interpreted in the following lines.
At low pH values (pH < 5), the low removal percentages (R% < 15%) can be attributed to the increase in the positive charge density at the SLSLPAN surface according to the following reaction:

Accordingly, electrostatic repulsion occurs between Sr2+ ion, the predominant species at these pHs (Fig. 6B), and the positively charged groups at the adsorbent which decreased the removal efficiency at the lower studied pH values. Further increase in the solution pH resulted into the formation of negatively charged adsorption sites on the adsorbent:

Although negatively charged active sites are formed on SLSLPAN surface, the removal percentage is still undesirable (R% < 50%) particularly at pH < 10. This low adsorption is attributed to the requirement of two adsorption sites for electrostatic attraction of Sr2+ with the adsorbent:

At higher pH values, one adsorption site, –OSO3-, is involved in the adsorption process due to the formation of SrOH+ in aqueous solution:

Consequently, the removal efficiency of strontium(II) reached its maximum value (R% ≃ 98%) at the higher studied pH values and the pH range 11–13 is considered the optimum.
3.5. Effect of temperature and estimation of thermodynamic parameters
The relationship between temperature and the distribution coefficient (Kd, mL/g) for adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN at pH 11.5 is represented in Fig. 7. This figure shows that elevating the temperature had a positive effect on the present adsorption process. by increasing temperature from 30 °C to 60 °C, the Kd value is increased from 458 mL/g to 1615 mL/g this increment in the Kd value with temperature suggested that adsorption of Strontium(II) radionuclides on SLSLPAN was an endothermic process.

Based on the data given in Fig. 7, the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy change ΔHo, entropy change ΔSo and free energy change ΔGo) for adsorption process of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN are determined using the following equations (Liu et al., 2019):
@(11)
@(12)
The plot of LnKd against 1/T for adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN (figure not shown) resulted in a straight line with high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9962). The slope (−4248.6) and the intercept (20.118) of this straight line are employed for estimation of ΔHo and ΔSo according to Eq. (11), respectively, and their values are tabulated in Table 3. The positive value of enthalpy change (ΔHo = 35.323 kJ/mol) confirmed the endothermic nature of strontium(II) adsorption onto SLSLPAN. On the other hand, the positive entropy change (ΔSo = 0.167 kJ/mol K) indicated the decrease of randomness at the solid/liquid interface during adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN. By substitution of ΔHo and ΔSo in Eq. (12) with their corresponding values recorded in Table 3, the free energy change at the studied temperatures (303–333 K) could be calculated and the obtained values are given in Table 3. This table shows that adsorption process of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN was spontaneous and feasible, where negative values of ΔGo are obtained. The decrease of ΔGo values with temperature increase from 303 to 333 K revealed that higher temperatures facilitate the adsorption process of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN.

Fig. 8 shows the effect of initial concentration of strontium(II) ion, in the range 0.11–6.85 mmol/L, on its removal efficiency percentage (represented at the left y-axis) and its adsorbed amount (the right y-axis) using SLSLPAN. The pH of the solution, SLSLPAN dose, equilibrium time and temperature were remained constant at 11.5, 6 g/L, 24 h and 30 °C, respectively. The data depicted in this figure demonstrate that the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides and its amount adsorbed are obviously dependent on the initial concentration of the adsorbate. The removal efficiency of strontium(II) (>99% at 0.11 mmol/L) is decreased with increasing its initial concentration and reached to 34.5% at 6.85 mmol/L, which is attributed to saturation of the adsorption sites at SLSLPAN's surface. On the other hand, increasing the initial concentration from 0.11 mmol/L to 6.85 mmol/L increased the amount of strontium(II) adsorbed onto the synthesized material from 0.019 mmol/g to 0.395 mmol/g. The increase in the mass driving force of strontium(II) ions toward the adsorption sites at SLSLPAN's surface can be considered the main reason for the significant enhancement in the adsorbed amount at high initial concentration (Zhang et al., 2016a, Zhang et al., 2016b).

To determine the appropriate adsorption isotherm model for describing the equilibrium isotherm data (the relationship between the equilibrium concentration of strontium(II) ion and its adsorbed amount per gram of SLSLPAN, figure not shown), several two-parameter isotherm models (Freundlich (Eq. (13)), Langmuir (Eq. (14)) and Tempkin (Eq. (15)) and three-parameter isotherm ones (Redlich-Peterson (Eq. (16)), Toth (Eq. (17)) and Generalized (Eq. (18)) are tested in the current study for the concerned adsorption process. Non-linear forms of these models are expressed as follow (Soliman et al., 2019; Foo and Hameed, 2010; Gimbert et al., 2008):
@(13)
@(14)
@(15)
@(16)
@(17)
@(18)
where qe is the amount of Strontium(II) adsorbed at equilibrium (mmol/g), qm is the maximum adsorption capacity of SLSLPAN toward Strontium(II) ion (mmol/g) and Ce is the equilibrium concentration of Strontium(II) ion (mmol/L). By fitting the experimental adsorption isotherm data of Strontium(II) ion onto SLSLPAN to the aforementioned isotherm models (Eq. (13)–18) by the non-linear analysis method using OriginPro 8.5 software, the isotherm parameters of Freundlich (KF and NF), Langmuir (KL and qm), Tempkin (A and X), Redlich-Peterson (KR, bR and g), Toth (KT, bT and NT) and Generalized (KG, qm and NG) are obtained, which are tabulated in Table 4 together with the corresponding correlation coefficients (R2). Commonly, the fitness of isotherm models to the experimental data is evaluated based on the value of R2. By comparing the values of R2 given in Table 4, it can be markedly seen that Freundlich (R2 = 0.8793) and Tempkin (R2 = 0.9412) exhibited lower values than Langmuir (R2 = 0.9879), Redlich-Peterson (R2 = 0.9886), Toth (R2 = 0.9889) and Generalized model (R2 = 0.9896), and thus had not the ability to well-represent the present experimental isotherm data. While, the other four isotherm models show good fitness to the experimental isotherm data of strontium(II) onto SLSLPAN. In order to find out the most convenient isotherm model to describe the obtained data, two error functions, namely, residual sum of square (RSS) and Chi-square (χ2) are used which are written by the following equations (Hararah et al., 2012; Afkhami et al., 2010):
@(19)
@(20)
where Nd is the number of experimental data points. The lower the values of these two error functions the better the ability of the model to fit the experimental data. The values of RSS and χ2 obtained for the studied adsorption isotherm models are given in Table 4. By comparing these values, it can be observed that the Generalized isotherm model had the lowest values. Accordingly, it is concluded that the Generalized model is the best one to describe the adsorption isotherm data of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN. The obtained value of NG (0 < NG = 0.858 < 1) suggesting that adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLS-loaded PAN is favorable process. Based on the Generalized isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of SLSLPAN for strontium(II) is found to be 0.391 mmol/g.

The adsorption isotherm data of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN if further analyzed by Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model in order to estimate the mean free energy of the adsorption process. Its value is useful to discriminate between physical and chemical adsorption of an adsorbate onto an adsorbent. This model is more general than Langmuir model where it does not assume a homogeneous surface or constant adsorption potential (Mahmoud et al., 2014). The non-linear form of the D-R isotherm model is represented by the following equation (Dubinin and Radushkevich, 1947):
@(21)
where qe and qm (mmol/g) are previously defined, KDR is the activity coefficient related to the adsorption energy (mol2/kJ2) and ε is the Polanyi potential (kJ/mol) which is calculated as follow:
@(22)
where R is the universal gas constant (R = 0.008314 kJ/mol) and T is the absolute temperature (K). The values of qm and KDR, determined from non-linear fitting of the equilibrium isotherm data of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN, are found to be 0.365 mmol/g and 0.108 mol2/kJ2, respectively (Fig. 9). Based on the value of KDR, the mean free energy (E, kJ/mol) of the present adsorption process is calculated by using the following relation:
@(23)
Fig. 9. Dubinin-Radushkevich (D–R) plot for equilibrium data of strontium(II) ion onto SLSLPAN.
If the magnitude of E lies between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, the adsorbate adsorbs on adsorbent via ion-exchange or chemisorption. Whereas, physisorption is the removal mechanism for E values below 8 kJ/mol (Mahmoud et al., 2014). Regarding the calculated value of mean free energy (E = 2.151 kJ/mol) recorded in Fig. 9, it can be deduced that strontium(II) radionuclides are physically adsorbed onto SLSLPAN. Previous studies also reported that removal of samarium(III) by sulfonate-functionalized adsorbent is governed by physisorption (Mahmoud et al., 2015). Furthermore, physisorptin process was responsible for removal of strontium(II) by various functionalized adsorbents (Xia et al., 2019; Mahindrakar and Rathod, 2018; Ma et al., 2011; Chegrouche et al., 2009).
3.7. Comparison with various adsorbents
To evaluate its potentiality, the maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of SLSLPAN achieved in the present work for strontium(II) is compared with those previously reported for various adsorbents (Table 5). This table shows that the employed adsorbent exhibited adsorption capacity higher than most of other ones given in this table. This implies that it compares well with other adsorbents and hence it can be concluded that SLSLPAN can be considered as a good adsorbent and a promising one for removal of strontium(II) from aqueous solutions.

3.8. Effect of ionic strength on adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides
The influence of NaCl concentration on the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides using 6 g/L SLS-loaded PAN at pH 11.5 is illustrated in Fig. 10. As shown by this figure, the removal efficiency of strontium(II) is strongly affected by the electrolyte concentration. By increasing the electrolyte concentration, the removal efficiency is deleteriously affected and reached to 26.9% at 0.5 mol/L NaCl. Aqueous speciation of strontium(II) ion at pH 11.5 in presence of 0.5 mol/L NaCl, calculated using PHREEQC software, showed that it presents in the aqueous solution as 94.11% Sr2+, 5.77% SrCl+ and 0.12% SrOH+. Comparing these values with those obtained in Fig. 6B (99.53% Sr2+, 0.46 SrCl+ and 0.01% SrOH+), it can be seen that there is no significant change in strontium(II) speciation. Therefore, the reduction in the removal efficiency shown in Fig. 10 cannot be attributed to alteration of strontium(II) speciation. By increasing the ionic strength, the concentration of Na+ ion is increased in the aqueous solution which deleteriously influenced the dissociation of the surfactant's sulfonate group where its counter ion is Na+ cation. This process resulted into the formation of SLS-SO3Na at PAN's particles rather than formation of anionic sites (SLS-SO3-) capable of binding with strontium(II). Thus, the removal efficiency of strontium(II) radionuclides is reduced with increasing the ionic strength of the solution.

4. Conclusions
Loading of SLS onto PAN produced an efficient adsorbent for strontium(II) radionuclides. The equilibrium was attained within 14 h with removal percentage of about 98% and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model was the best one for describing the kinetic data. Based on the diffusion study, the intraparticle diffusion was the rate-limiting step during the present adsorption process. Results of the solution pH effect clarified that strontium(II) radionuclides were efficiently removed by SLSLPAN at pH values ≥ 10. Thermodynamic investigations revealed that adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN was endothermic (ΔHo = 35.323 kJ/mol) and spontaneous (ΔGo had a negative sign at the studied temperatures) with the decrease of randomness at the solid/liquid interface (ΔSo = 0.167 kJ/mol) during the adsorption process. The adsorption isotherm data of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN were fitted well by the Generalized isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 0.391 mmol/g. The estimated mean free energy for adsorption of strontium(II) radionuclides onto SLSLPAN was found to be 2.151 kJ/mol, which suggested a physical interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent.
