Abstract
The removal of U(VI) by biochar fibers from aqueous solutions has been investigated prior and after MnO2 surface-deposition. The removal efficiency has been studied as a function of pH, U(VI) concentration, ionic strength, temperature and contact time. The fibers morphology and surface complexes were analyzed by SEM–EDX and FTIR, respectively. Evaluation of the experimental data indicates that the composite presents extraordinary adsorption capacity (qmax = 3.8 mmol g−1, 904 mg g−1), which is attributed to the formation of inner-sphere surface complexes, and that the adsorption reaction is a relatively fast, endothermic and entropy-driven process.
Introduction
Uranium removal and recovery from industrial process solutions and (waste)waters is of particular interest with respect to environmental protection and sustainable development. In this context, cost effective remediation technologies are of particular interest. Recently, biosorption was presented as an alternative method for the removal of uranium from industrial process solutions and wastewaters [1]. Because of various advantages (e.g. easy disposal, environment-friendly) technologies based on biomass often replace conventional processes in (waste)water treatment processes for the accumulation and removal of (radio)toxic metals from aqueous solutions. Biomass by-products and particularly plant tissues are attractive for the development of inexpensive adsorbent materials because these materials are very abundant, non-hazardous, low cost, and can be easily disposed by incineration [1, 2].
Adsorption of U(VI) on biomass by-products [1,2,3,4] is extensively investigated, and there are several studies dealing with U(VI) adsorption on biomass by-products prior and after chemical modification [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Those modifications include surface oxidation and modification with chelating ligands, as well as surface coating with metal oxides to enhance selectivity towards U(VI) cations [3, 5,6,7,8,9,10]. In addition, carbon-based composite materials are of particular interested because such materials may present besides their increased adsorption capacity and selectivity for U(VI), magnetic properties, which could be very attractive for the adsorbent separation. [11]. Regarding the adsorption of U(VI) by carbon-based materials coated with MnO2 or carbon–MnO2 composites, the number of relevant studies is limited. These studies include U(VI) adsorption from aqueous solution by MnO2-loaded microorganism-derived carbon [7], graphene oxide-manganese dioxide composites [8], MnO2-modified honeycomb-like porous carbon materials [9], as well as MnO2-coated plant fibers [3] and resins [10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies related to uranium adsorption by MnO2-modified biochar fibers.
The present study deals with the adsorption of U(VI) by biochar fibers derived from Luffa cylindrica after MnO2 deposition. MnO2 deposition on the biochar fibers is expected to enhance their separation efficiency and affinity towards U(VI) cations [7,8,9, 12]. This study aims to investigate the effect of various parameters (e.g. pH, U(VI) concentration, ionic strength, temperature and contact time) on the adsorption performance and determine thermodynamic parameters (e.g. Kd, ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS°), which are of fundamental importance for both the assessment of the chemical behavior of U(VI) cations in aquatic environments and the development of water treatment technologies. Moreover, FTIR and SEM measurements have been performed to elucidate the type of the formed surface species and the morphology of the MnO2–biochar fiber composites, respectively.
Materials and methods
The experiments, except those related to the temperature effect, were performed at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) under ambient conditions in aqueous solutions. The preparation of the uranium stock solution was prepared by dissolution of UO2(NO3)2·6H2O in de-ionized water, and the U(VI) concentration in solution was determined by spectrophotometry using arsenazo-III [13]. pH measurements were performed by a commercial glass electrode, which was calibrated using a series of buffer solutions (pH 2, 4, 7 and 10). The adsorbents used in this study were biochar fibers prepared from Luffa cylindrica fibers as described elsewhere [6, 14].
Biochar fibers
The plant fibers were washed thoroughly by distilled water and dehydrated at 110 °C for 15 h. Following the fibers were carbonized under N2-atmosphere and oxidized (OCF) by means of 8 M HNO3, as described elsewhere [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. The carbonized product was sieved and the particle fraction between 200 and 500 μm was selected for the adsorption experiments. The preparation of the MnO2–biochar fiber composites was carried out using KMnO4 solutions as described elsewhere [3, 15]. The determination of the morphology of the fibers and EDX measurements were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Vega TS5136LS- Tescan), specific surface area measurements were based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory and were determined by means of N2-adsorption (ASAP 2000, micromeritics). FTIR spectroscopic measurements were performed by means of prepared translucent KBr disks using an FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu), prior and after U(VI) adsorption. Formation of solid phases has been investigated also by means of powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer.
Adsorption measurements
In order to investigate the effect of various parameters (e.g. pH, U(VI) concentration, ionic strength, temperature and contact time) on the U(VI) adsorption on the oxidized biochar fibers (OCF) and the MnO2–biochar composites (OCF-MnO2), different classes of experiments were conducted. In these experiments the parameter under investigation was varied, while other experimental parameters were kept constant. The effect of pH was studied in an adsorption system (0.01 g adsorbent and 30 mL of the test solution [U(VI)] = 5 × 10−4 M) in which pH was varied between 1 and 8 by addition of 0.1 M HClO4 or 0.1 M NaOH. The other parameters for both materials (e.g. OCF and OCF-MnO2) were studied at pH 3 in order to avoid hydrolysis and precipitation of U(VI) [5, 6]. The effect of the ionic strength (salinity) was studied by addition of NaClO4 salt to prepare solutions of various concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 M) at constant adsorbent amount (0.01 g) and total U(VI) concentration (5 × 10−4 M). For studying the effect of initial U(VI) concentration, the latter was varied between 1 × 10−5 M and 9 × 10−3 M, at a prefixed amount of adsorbent (adsorbent dosage = 0.01 g) and pH 3. The effect of temperature was studied between 10 and 70 °C at the same conditions that are described above. After an equilibration time of 24 h the metal concentration was determined by spectrophotometry [13] after separation of the solution using membrane filters. For each test solution, a corresponding reference solution was prepared and was similar to the test solution except that it didn’t contain the composite adsorbent. For kinetic studies a certain amount of the biomasses (0.01 g) was mixed with 30 mL of U(VI) solution (5 × 10−4 M) at pH 3. Generally, the experiments were performed in duplicate and the mean values have been used for data evaluation, which has been performed as described elsewhere [5, 6].
The relative amount of U(VI) adsorbed was determined using the following equations:
Rel.adsorption%=100×([U(VI)]o−[U(VI)]aq)[U(VI)]o
(1)
Kd=([U(VI)]0−[U(VI)]aq)[U(VI)]aq⋅Vm(lkg−1)
(2)
where [U(VI)]o = the total uranium concentration (mol L−1) in the system or in the reference solution, [U(VI)]aq = uranium concentration (mol L−1) in the test solution, V (L) is the volume of the test solution and m (kg) is the mass of the adsorbent.
Results and discussion
Fiber characterization
In order to prove the formation of the biochar fiber MnO2-composites (OCF-MnO2), the products were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and a representative XRD diffractogram is shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.4, 36.5, 41.5 and 65.9 of the (b) biochar fiber MnO2–composites, which correspond to the XRD pattern of the manganese oxide (JCPDS 80-1098), indicate successful deposition of MnO2 on the biochar surface [16, 17]. On the other hand, the broad peak at 2θ = 24° is characteristic for graphite-type materials [5, 14].

In addition, Fig. 2 presents SEM images of biochars fibers (a) prior and (b) after MnO2 deposition, which clearly show distinct MnO2 crystallites formed on the biochar surface (white spots) and that chemical modification did not affect the texture of the fibers. In addition, the corresponding SEM–EDX spectra (Fig. 1S, Supplementary Information) prove the presence of Mn on the biochar fiber surface. Even after chemical modification the fibers keep their laminated texture, which is responsible for their increased external surface. According to BET measurements there is no internal mesoporous surface (BET surface < 5 m2 g−1), which is expected because the plant fibers were carbonized at temperatures below 650 °C [18].

Moreover, the FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) of biochar fibers prior and after MnO2 deposition differ significantly indicating successful modification of the biochar surface. Generally, the broad band at ~ 3450 cm−1 is attributed to –OH groups, and the peaks at 2927 and 2856 cm−1 correspond to CH2 deformation vibrations. The bands in the region between 1730 and 1450 cm−1 are ascribed to aliphatic or aromatic groups (e.g. C=C) and/or carbonyl C=O stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1627 cm−1 and 1360 cm−1 could be associated also to O–H bending vibrations of absorbed water [18]. After MnO2 deposition, the carbonyl band at 1700 cm−1 becomes a weak sideband and new peaks at 1389 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 appear, which are associated with the the coordination of Mn by the O–H group and the coupling mode between Mn–O stretching modes, respectively [19, 20]. The broad peak in the low-frequency region around 600 cm−1 is a characteristic absorption band corresponding to Mn–O stretching modes of MnO2 [19, 20], which is consistent with the previous XRD result.

pH effect
The relative adsorption depends on both the chemical behavior of U(VI) ions in solution and the surface charge of the adsorbent. Hence, the solution pH is an important parameter affecting U(VI) adsorption on surfaces, because pH governs both speciation of U(VI) in solution and the surface charge of an adsorbent. Moreover, pH is related to the H+ concentration in solution, that may compete with the metal ions by interacting with the surface active groups (e.g. carboxylic- and hydroxy-groups). To study the effect of pH on the U(VI) adsorption, samples of the two different biochar products were conducted with U(VI) solutions at different pH values (1 < pH < 8).
The effect of pH on the relative adsorption of U(VI) by the two different biochar materials is shown in Fig. 4. In the case of the oxidized biochar fibers (OCF) the relative adsorption increases with increasing pH and reaches a maximum value (∼ 100%) for pH > 5. For pH values below 5 the relative adsorption decreases with pH due to the protonation of the surface carboxylic and/or hydroxy groups, which are present at the surface of the oxidized biochar fibers and their MnO2 composites, respectively, and bind the U(VI) ions as described schematically for instance by Eqs. 3 and 4. The extensive desorption of U(VI) from the materials at pH < 2 assumes that the materials could be recycled and reused after treatment with dilute acids.

The effect of pH on the relative adsorption of U(VI) by biochar fibers prior and after MnO2 surface deposition
The adsorption of U(VI) by the oxidized biochar fibers after MnO2 surface modification is indicated also by SEM–EDX spectra (Fig. 2S, Supplementary Information), which include besides manganese (Mn) also the characteristic bands of uranium (U). The carbon (C–Ka) and oxygen (O–Ka) bands correspond to the oxidized biochar fibers, whereas the potassium (K–Ka) band in the SEM–EDX spectra originates from the potassium permanganate (KMnO4), which was used as precursor agent for the MnO2 deposition. Specifically, the manganese peaks around 0.6 keV and 5.9 keV correspond to Mn–La and Mn–Ka, respectively, whereas the small peak around 3.1 keV is attributed to U–Ma.
Effect of the U(VI) concentration
In order to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) adsorption experiments with varying U(VI) concentrations have been performed at the optimum pH 3. The corresponding isotherms, which have been well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model, are graphically shown in Fig. 5. A magnification of the low concentration region is shown in Fig. 3S (Supplementary Information). The Langmuir isotherm model is based on the assumption that all surface sites are similar and independent of their neighbouring sites occupancy. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacity qmax is expected to coincide with the maximum number of surface sites available for adsorption [5, 6]. The Langmuir isotherm model can be described by Eq. 5:
qmax=qmax⋅KL⋅Ce1+KL⋅Ce
(5)
where qmax is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (mg g−1) and KL is the Langmuir isotherm constant (L mg−1) related to adsorption energy.

The data evaluation reveals that the biochar fiber MnO2-composites (qmax = 3.8 ± 0.1 mmol g−1, 904 ± 24 mg g−1, R = 0.99) present higher adsorption capacity for U(VI) than the non-modified biochar fibers (qmax = 0.4 ± 0.3 mmol g−1, 95 ± 71 mg g−1, R = 0.97). Moreover, this value is significantly higher than corresponding values obtained for the U(VI) adsorption by MnO2 deposited on graphene oxide (qmax = 0.78 mmol g−1, 186.6 mg g−1) [21], MnO2-loaded microorganism-derived carbon (qmax = 0.87 mmol g−1, 207 mg g−1) [22] and MnO2-modified honeycomb-like porous carbon material [23]. This extraordinary high value obtained for the biochar fiber MnO2-composite could be ascribed to the MnO2 colloidal particles formed on the biochar surface. These small particles, which are stabilized on the biochar surface, offer an enormous large surface and amount of hydroxyl groups available for metal-ion adsorption. The qmax value of the composite material shows that chemical modification of the material improves its adsorption attributes, and that biochar fiber MnO2–composites can be used as an alternative for MnO2 resins [15].
After U(VI) adsorption the modified biochar fibers have been investigated by means of XRD and the corresponding data (Fig. 6) clearly indicated, that within the investigated concentration range and pH 3 no formation of U(VI) solid phase (e.g. UO2(OH)2) is observed, indicating pure adsorption processes and no surface precipitation [5]. At pH 3, no surface precipitation is expected due to the increased solubility of UO2(OH)2. However, in weak acidic and near neutral solutions (4 < pH < 8) surface precipitation of UO2(OH)2 occurs (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Information) and has to be taken in consideration to avoid overestimation of adsorption capacity values [5, 6].

The effect of ionic strength/salinity on the adsorption efficiency
The effect of ionic strength 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 M NaClO4 on the relative adsorption of U(VI) was investigated, in order to understand the interaction mechanisms on which U(VI) binding on the two different types of biochar materials is based. The experimental data obtained from the corresponding experiments are graphically summarized in Fig. 7 and show that the relative adsorption of the oxidized (OCF) and the biochar fiber MnO2-composites (OCF-MnO2) is almost not affected by increasing salinity and indicates specific interactions between U(VI) and the active surface groups (carboxylic and hydroxy groups) of the respective adsorbents. Hence, the adsorption can be attributed to the formation of inner-sphere complexes, which are only little affected by salinity changes [24].

Moreover, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded to identify the functional groups and elucidate the adsorption mechanism corresponding to the U(VI) adsorption by the biochar adsorbents prior and after modification. The FTIR spectra of oxidized biochar fibers (OCF) and the corresponding MnO2-composites (OCF-MnO2) after successive U(VI) adsorption are shown in Fig. 8. After U(VI) adsorption and depending on the U(VI) concentration the relative intensity of the bands in the range between 1700 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 changes dramatically, indicating the formation of inner-sphere complexes between U(VI) and the surface active species (e.g. carboxylic groups) [5, 6]. This is in agreement with the results obtained from the experiments related to the effect of salinity, which also indicated formation of inner-sphere complexes.

FTIR spectra of the oxidized biochar fibers (OCF) after successive U(VI) adsorption at pH 3
Regarding the FTIR spectra of the biochar MnO2-composites after successive U(VI) adsorption (Fig. 9), the relative intensity of the characteristic bands at 1580, 1360 and 511 cm−1 changes significantly indicating that mainly the hydroxyl groups of the MnO2 phase bind the U(VI) ions to form stable inner-sphere complexes (e.g. Mn–O–U(VI)) [23] and are in agreement with the results obtained from the experiments related to the effect of salinity. Moreover, the characteristic band of the asymmetric O=U=O vibration is shifted to lower wavenumbers (from 921 to 912 cm−1), indicating the formation of a more stable surface complex. The more stable complexes on the surface of the modified material could be attributed to the formation of a bidentate surface complex [25].

The effect of temperature on the adsorption efficiency
The effect of temperature on U(VI) adsorption biochar fibers prior and after MnO2 surface deposition was investigated to estimate the corresponding thermodynamic data (ΔH° and ΔS°) [5, 6]. The Kd values together with the linear form of the van’t Hoff Eq. (6) and the Gibbs free energy isotherm Eq. (7) have been used to estimate the corresponding thermodynamic data [5, 6]

Evaluation of the data (Fig. 10) shows that adsorption of U(VI) on the biochar fibers (OCF) and composites (OCF- MnO2) is an endothermic and entropy-driven spontaneous process. Specifically, the values of the thermodynamic parameters are for the adsorption of U(VI) on OCF: ΔH° = 28 kJ mol−1 and ΔS° = 139 J mol−1 K−1 (R = 0.93), and on OCF-MnO2: ΔH° = − 20 kJ mol−1 and ΔS° = 161 J mol−1 K−1 (R = 0.96). Generally, the values of the thermodynamic parameters evaluated are similar to corresponding values reported in the literature for MnO2 composite materials [3, 5, 6, 21,22,23].

Kinetic measurements
According to Fig. 11, which shows the relative amount of adsorbed U(VI) as a function of time, the adsorption of U(VI) by the two different biochar materials is a relatively fast, which reaches equilibrium within the first 50 min.

The experimental adsorption kinetic data have been evaluated by two different kinetic models, the pseudo-first order [26] and the pseudo-second order kinetic model [27]. The corresponding equations which have been used for the calculation of the kinetic constants (k1 and k2) are given by Eqs. (8 and 9):
ln(qe−qt)=lnqe−k1t
(8)
where qe is the adsorbed amount of the metal ion in equilibrium (mol kg−1), qt is the adsorbed amount of the metal ion at time t (mol kg−1), k1 is the kinetic constant of the pseudo-first order kinetic model (min−1) and t is the time (min).
tq(t)=tqe+1k2q2e
(9)
where k2 is the kinetic constant of the pseudo-second kinetic model (mol kg−1 min−1).
Figure 12a, b show the experimental data fitted by the two different models and indicate that the U(VI) adsorption on the two fibers types are better described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model model (R = 0.999). The values of the kinetic constants are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions
In this study oxidized and MnO2-modified biochar fibers prepared from fibres were used to adsorb U(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. SEM and XRD measurements indicate the successful preparation of the OCF-MnO2 composites and the experimental data indicate increased affinity of both materials for U(VI), which is dramatically improved by chemical modification and the formation of MnO2 microparticles on the biochar surface. The equilibrium data were described well by a Langmuir isotherm, indicating that the U(VI) adsorption on biochar materials is based on specific chemical interactions, which is corroborated by experiments of varying ionic strength/salinity and FTIR studies after U(VI) adsorption. The thermodynamic and kinetic measurements indicate that the U(VI) adsorption on the non- and MnO2-modified biochar fibers is a relatively fast and entropy-driven process.
