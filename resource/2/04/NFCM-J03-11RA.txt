ABSTRACT
The isothermal and cyclic corrosion behavior of yttria (Y2O3)-stabilized zirconia (ZrO2) in a LiCl-Li2O molten salt were investigated at 650 °C in an argon atmosphere. During isothermal and cyclic corrosion tests in the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O for 168 h and 7 thermal cycles, the corrosion rate was very low, whereas under the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O-Li for 168 h, the corrosion rate was almost 10 times higher than that in the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O. No corrosion product was detected until 168 h for the isothermal corrosion test, however, after 7 thermal cycles, a very-low-intensity Li2ZrO3 peak was detected at the beginning stage of the chemical reaction between ZrO2 and Li2O. Additionally, in the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O-Li for 168 h, a large amount of Li2ZrO3 was formed, with evidence of marked cracks, pores, and spallations on the corroded surface. The introduction of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 was beneficial in increasing the hot corrosion resistance of the structural materials used to handle molten salts containing Li2O at elevated temperature without forming a lithium at the cathode during the electrolytic reduction process.

1. Introduction
In recent years, electroreduction of metal oxide in molten salt has become quite popular. Since the process was demonstrated for a variety of metals for general industries, its application has been extended to one of the emerging nuclear fuel cycle technology. Pyroprocessing, which is based on electrolysis using high-temperature molten salts as the reaction medium, is one of the key technologies for reducing the amount of spent nuclear fuel and destroying toxic waste products, such as long-life fission products [1,2]. The electrolytic reduction process which is one unit of pyroprocessing system involves electrolytically reducing spent oxide fuel to its metallic form [3–5]. However, molten salts can corrode container materials and various components of electrolysis equipment. Corrosion resistance has long been one of the important parameters used to determine the suitability of a given material in structural applications requiring continued exposure to molten salt at elevated temperature. Hence, studies on the corrosion of the equipment and structural materials used for handling molten salts at elevated temperature have been continuously performed. Consequently, superalloys have been developed for high-temperature application [6–14]. However, the corrosion resistance of these alloys mainly relies on the thermodynamic properties of a formed oxide layer against the corrosive environment. Both the composition and physical properties of the oxide layer determine the corrosion resistance of the base metal. Hence, ceramic structural materials are known to be more effective than metallic materials for long-term chemical stability in molten salt environments at elevated temperature [15,16]. However, there are few reports in the literature that describe the effects of lithium chloride molten salts containing Li2O on the corrosion resistance of ceramic structural materials.
In the present study, we selected a ceramic material, Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), which is known to be mechanically and chemically stable in elevated-temperature corrosive environments, and investigated its elevated-temperature corrosion behavior under simulated electrolytic reduction conditions.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Material and preparation
The YSZ used identically in this study had a nominal composition (wt.%) (SiO2: 0.02, Al2O3: 0.60, CaO: 0.05, Fe2O3: 0.05, ZrO2: 93.57, Y2O3: 5.30, Mirae Co., Ltd. Korea). Specimens were prepared with dimensions of 70 mm (l) × 15 mm (w) × 3 mm (t). The specimens were ground with SiC paper, polished with diamond paste, and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone before being subjected to the elevated temperature corrosion test.
2.2. Processing
The experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 1. An as-purchased LiCl (Rare Metallic Co., Ltd., Japan, 99.9%) and Li2O (Cerac, USA, −100 mesh, 99.5%) powder mixture was introduced into a high-density MgO crucible and then heated at 300 °C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere to remove any possible moisture. After heating to the desired temperature (650 °C), the specimens were immersed in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt. The isothermal corrosion exposures consisted of exposure for 72 h to 168 h at 650 °C in an argon atmosphere in a glove box. The cyclic corrosion exposures consisted of 7 cycles at 650 °C in an argon atmosphere in a glove box. Each cycle involved exposure at 650 °C for 24 h in a LiCl-Li2O molten salt and for 48 h at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. The Li2O concentration was 1 wt.%, which is in the general concentration for electrolytic reduction processes. The Li concentration was 1 wt.% for the consideration of lithium formation at the cathode during the electrolytic reduction process. Following the isothermal and cyclic corrosion tests, the specimens were removed from the salt and kept in a reactor under an argon atmosphere while the furnace was cooled to room temperature.

2.3. Characterization
After the reactor was opened, the specimens were removed and examined visually. They were then ultrasonically cleaned in acetone/ethanol and then deionized water to prevent the damage of corrosion surface and dried for more than 24 h in a drying oven. The initial and final weights of the specimens exposed to the molten salt were measured to assess the extent of corrosion. The corroded specimens were then cut using a diamond cutter and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for characterization. The microstructures, morphologies, and chemical compositions of the corroded surface were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6300) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, DMAX/1200) was employed to analyze the phase evolution of the corroded specimen surface.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Corrosion rate
The weight changes of the YSZ specimens after the isothermal and cyclic corrosion tests at 650 °C in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt for 72 h, 168 h, and 7 thermal cycles and in the LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt for 168 h are presented in Figure 2. The corrosion rate during the isothermal test was slightly lower than that of the cyclic corrosion test. However, under the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O-Li for 168 h, the corrosion rate was about 10 times higher than those of the isothermal and cyclic corrosion tests in the molten salt of LiCl-Li2O. If lithium is generated during the electrolytic reduction process, the concentration of Li2O can be increased by the reduction of ZrO2. Under the high-temperature molten salt including a little high concentration of Li2O, a chemically aggressive environment is created, which is excessively corrosive; Li2ZrO3 is formed by the reaction between ZrO2 and Li2O and continuous elimination of the corrosion product occurs. In this study, YSZ is chemically attacked by Li2O as well as Li in the molten salt and the main corrosion product is Li2ZrO3. Due to density difference between YSZ (density: ∼5.8 g/cm3) and Li2ZrO3 (density: ∼4.16 g/cm3). It causes a spallation owing to volume change on the YSZ and disintegration of the stabilized crystal structure of YSZ. Some weight gain due to the formation of Li2ZrO3 could occur; however, we believe it to be negligible compared to the weight loss because the corroded surface layer was removed during cleaning of the specimens after the corrosion experiments. The corrosion rate is greatly affected by forming a lithium metal at the cathode during the electrolytic reduction process. Both the morphological features and composition of the corroded surface specimen are presented in Section 3.3. The weight loss of the YSZ is about 1/80 less value compared to that of nickel-base alloy at 650 °C in a LiCl-Li2O molten salt for 168 h [17].

3.2. Phase determination of the corroded surface
Figure 3 presents XRD patterns of the surface of YSZ corroded at 650 °C in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt for 72 and 168 h compared with that of the as-received specimen. No evidence of chemical interaction between the Li2O in the molten LiCl and YSZ is observed. This finding indicates that Li2O did not have a chemical effect on the YSZ at 650 °C until 168 h for the isothermal corrosion test.

XRD patterns of the surface of YSZ corroded at 650 °C in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt for 7 thermal cycles compared with that of the as-received specimen are presented in Figure 4. The XRD analysis reveals the almost same pattern as that for the isothermal corrosion test (Figure 3) except for the low intensity of the Li2ZrO3 peak, which indicates the early stage of the reaction between Li2O and YSZ for the 7 thermal cycles.

Figure 5 presents an XRD pattern of the surface of YSZ corroded at 650 °C in the LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt for 168 h compared with that of the as-received specimen, which is shown in the inset. The corrosion product of m/t-Li2ZrO3 (m: monoclinic, t: tetragonal) was formed on the specimen surface, most likely from the reaction between Li2O and ZrO2. The formation of Li2ZrO3 is thermodynamically favorable according to Equation (1) [18,19]:
Zr O2+Li2O=Li2 Zr O3,G650∘C=−65.88 kJ / mol .(1)

In addition, the aforementioned corrosion product is thermodynamically stable, and the formation of this product agrees well with the results of theoretical calculations (based on ZrO2: 94.7 wt.%, Y2O3: 5.3 wt.%, LiCl: 100 wt.%, Li2O: 1 wt.%, Li: 1 wt.%) obtained using HSC Chemistry software [18], which calculates the amounts of products at equilibrium in the isothermal and isobaric conditions based on the Gibbs energy minimization of components under the consideration, as shown in Figure 6. The corrosion test time may not be sufficient to reach the equilibrium condition, but the interpretation is valid because the phases obtained by XRD, in particular Li2ZrO3 and thermodynamic calculations, are the same. It should be noted that Zr metal is formed when Li is considered in this calculation. There is significant volume and crystal structural changes after the reduction of YSZ by Li, and hence acceleration of corrosion could be predicted compared to the LiCl-Li2O molten salt system without formation of Li.

3.3. Hot corrosion behavior
Figure 7 presents SEM images of the morphologies of the surface of as-received YSZ (Figure 7(a)) and corroded at 650 °C for 72 h (Figure 7(b)), 168 h (Figure 7(c)), and 7 cycles (Figure 7(d)) in LiCl-Li2O molten salt and for 168 h in LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt (Figure 7(e-1,e-2)). With continued exposure, the surfaces became rough without significant changes. However, the microstructure drastically changed to flower shape-like structures with the presence of some cracks and pores in LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt as shown in Figure 7(e-1,e-2). It is anticipated that the flower shape-like structures are related to the reduction reaction of ZrO2 by Li as confirmed by calculation result in Figure 6. The existence of metallic Zr was not confirmed by XRD. This is probably due to post oxidation by high oxygen affinity of Zr. The surface corroded at 650 °C for 168 h in LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt could become susceptible to surface corrosion kinetics [20,21]. This finding is consistent with the corrosion rate results presented in Figure 2. Consequently, the presence of more cracks and pores during the hot corrosion tests is expected to further accelerate the kinetics of surface corrosion [22].
Figure 7. Surface morphologies of YSZ: as-received specimen (a) and corroded at 650 °C for 72 h in LiCl-Li2O (b), 168 h in LiCl-Li2O (c), 7 thermal cycles in LiCl-Li2O (d), and 168 h in LiCl-Li2O-Li (e-1 and e-2).
Figure 8 presents a surface SEM image and EDS analysis results of the YSZ specimen corroded at 650 °C for 72 h in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt. The surface morphology appears to be slightly coarse compared to that of the as-received specimen. The localized EDS analysis results confirm that the corroded surface contains almost the same amount of Zr, Y, and O as the as-received specimen (O: 18.05 wt.%, Y: 3.81 wt.%, Zr: 78.14 wt.%), with weight percentages of 76.63–79.98% Zr, 3.81–4.76% Y, and 16.79–18.05% O. Additionally, the XRD analysis (Figure 3) also shows that any reaction product on the surface could not be detected after the hot corrosion tests.

Figure 9 presents a surface SEM image and the EDS analysis results of the YSZ specimen corroded at 650 °C for 168 h in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt. The surface morphology appears to be slightly coarser than that after 72 h. The localized EDS analysis confirmed that the corroded surface (S2, S5) contained slightly lower Zr content (64.11–64.76 wt.%) and slightly higher O content (32.82–33.78 wt.%) than the as-received specimen. This indicates that an early stage of chemical reaction between Li2O and ZrO2, such as the production of Li2ZrO3 may have occurred on the limited surface of the coarse region (S2, S5). Consequently, the Li2ZrO3 peak was not detected in the XRD pattern in Figure 3. Additionally, with continued exposure, the partially coarse region would extend, and then, this corrosion product of Li2ZrO3 might agree well with the results of theoretical calculations (based on ZrO2: 94.7 wt.%, Y2O3: 5.3 wt.%, LiCl: 100 wt.%, Li2O: 1 wt.%) obtained using HSC Chemistry software [18] presented in Figure 10.

Figure 11 presents a surface SEM image and the EDS analysis results of the YSZ specimen corroded at 650 °C for 7 thermal cycles in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt. The surface morphology appears to be much coarser than that after 168 h. The localized EDS analysis results confirm that the highly corroded surface (S2, S3, and S4) contains much lower Zr (36.42–36.76 wt.%) and much higher O (63.18–63.26 wt.%) than the as-received specimen. From this result, it could be deduced that the highly corroded region is composed of Li2ZrO3 considering the XRD patterns in Figure 4, which is slightly modified compared with that of the as-received specimen with differences observed in the intensity and pattern of the ZrO2 peak.

Figure 12 presents a surface SEM image and the EDS analysis results of the YSZ specimen corroded at 650 °C for 168 h in the LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt. Some spallations appear on the corroded surface. The localized EDS analysis results obtained from the spalled regions (S2, S3, S5, and S6) confirm that the corroded surface contains much higher O (54.79–57.51 wt.%) and much lower Zr (42.19–45.21 wt.%) than the as-received specimen. Combining the XRD (Figure 5) and EDS (Figure 12) analyses, it can be deduced that the surface is Li2ZrO3, which also agrees well with the results of theoretical calculations obtained using HSC Chemistry software [18] presented in Figure 6. In addition, obvious cracks and spalls are observed on the surface (Figure 7(e-1,e-2)) and numerous flower shape-like particles (S4) are observed in the remainder. Specifically, a corroded surface spalled partially around the spalled area with a slightly higher O and slightly lower Zr content as that of the as-received specimen. When viewed at low magnifications of Figure 7(e-2) (Figure 13), large differences were observed in the elemental content of the corroded surface. The localized EDS analysis of the black regions (S1, S2, S3, and S4) and white regions (S5, S6, and S7) confirmed that the content of the black region is almost the same as that after 168 h for the isothermal process, whereas the white region contains much higher Zr (89.45–91.00 wt.%) and much lower O (5.52–7.09 wt.%) than the as-received specimen. It can be deduced that the reduction of ZrO2 occurred in the white region, which agrees well with the results of the theoretical calculations obtained using HSC Chemistry software [18] shown in Figure 6. In the LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt, ZrO2 is reduced by Li [19], thereby increasing the concentration of Li2O. This resulted in the formation of Li2ZrO3, as described in Section 3.1.

4. Conclusion
The isothermal and cyclic corrosion behavior of YSZ were investigated in an elevated-temperature corrosion environment, and the following conclusions were drawn:
(1) The corrosion rate during the isothermal test was slightly lower than that of the thermal cycling test. However, the corrosion rate in a molten salt of LiCl-Li2O-Li for 168 h was almost 10 times higher than those in a molten salt of LiCl-Li2O for 168 h and 7 thermal cycles.
(2) Due to its negligible amount, the corrosion product Li2ZrO3 was not detected by XRD until 168 h of the isothermal process was completed. However, this detection was clearly confirmed after 7 cycles of the thermal cycling process. Li2ZrO3 was also detected in the LiCl-Li2O-Li molten salt for 168 h.
(3) No evidence of marked cracks, pores, or spallations was observed on the corroded surface under any conditions, except when lithium was produced during the hot corrosion tests. The introduction of YSZ was observed to be beneficial for increasing the hot corrosion resistance of the structural materials used to handle the high-temperature molten salts containing Li2O conditions that are not favorable for forming lithium.
