Abstract
Palladium membranes have been used for hydrogen purification for a long time due to their infinite selectivity and excellent permeation performance. However, a coexisting impurity gas, like CO, will inhibit the hydrogen permeation flux that results from the concentration polarization (CP) and competitive adsorption inhibition effects. This work aims to investigate the two inhibition effects separately and quantitatively under different temperatures and pressures. Therefore, permeation experiments of H2 (90%)/N2 (10% to 5%)/CO (0% to 5%) mixtures have been carried out at temperatures ranging from 623 to 698 K and H2 partial pressure drops from 30 to 100 kPa. The permeation of H2/N2 is used to study CP because the competitive adsorption of N2 can be ignored. Then, the further H2 flux reduction of xH2/(1-x-z)N2/zCO permeation relative to that of xH2/(1-x)N2 permeation can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of CO. The experimental results show that the CP effect would be enhanced by increasing temperature and pressure, while the CO competitive adsorption effect would be depressed. Meanwhile, the CO inhibition effect generally becomes smaller when the membrane thickness becomes thicker. Based on the results in this work, operation conditions are suggested to be at a higher temperature and higher pressure for a thicker Pd membrane in consideration of increasing the H2 permeation flux and reducing the CO adsorption effect. The experimental and calculation methods used in this work can provide a new way for investigating the inhibition effect on hydrogen permeation caused by other nonpermeable gases like CO2, Ar, or H2O.

I. INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen energy has attracted more attention in recent years due to its environmentally friendly characteristics.1–8 In fact, hydrogen with high purity is needed for fuel cells9 and the nuclear fusion field.10 So, hydrogen should be deeply purified before its further application. For this purpose, technologies like cryogenic cooling, pressure swing adsorption, and a hydrogen-selective membrane can be used. Because of continuous operation and almost infinite selectivity, H2 separation with Pd membrane technology has already been widely used in the chemical industry and fusion field.11–15
For a fusion reactor, the plasma exhaust contains impurities such as CQ4, COx, N2, Ar, He, or NQ3 in hydrogen isotopes. In order to recover the hydrogen isotopes, the impurities should be eliminated. In these impurities, the inhibition extent of CO on hydrogen permeation through the Pd membrane is the most serious. The existing CO can inhibit H2 permeation significantly by two factors.16 First, it is generally believed that CO inhibits H2 permeation across Pd membranes by adsorbing on the surface and then covering the H2 dissociation sites, which is called the competitive adsorption effect. Second, the concentration polarization (CP) effect caused by nonpermeable gas accumulated at the upstream membrane surface can also inhibit H2 permeation. The extent of the inhibition effect depends on the gas composition, pressure, and temperature. In order to optimize the operation conditions for hydrogen purification with CO, the relationship between the inhibition effect extent of CO on H2 permeation and the operating temperature/pressure has been studied by many researchers. Kurokawa et al.17 investigated the inhibition effect of CO (1% and 5%) on H2 permeation between 623 and 773 K and calculated the inhibition effect extent by using normalized relative hydrogen flux. The inhibition effect extents were about 21.9% and 21.5% for 5% CO at 623 K when feed/permeate pressures were 200/100 and 600/500 kPa, respectively, while the inhibition effect was not obvious at higher temperatures. Pérez et al.18 studied the surface effects and CO/CO2 influence in H2 permeation through a Pd-Ag membrane. For 5% CO contained in H2 with a feed pressure of 500 kPa, the inhibition effect extents ranged from 75% to 10% with temperature increasing from 523 to 723 K. Miguel et al.19 found that the inhibition effect extents were from 80% to 50% when hydrogen permeation was carried out with 5% CO at a feed pressure of 210 kPa and temperature increasing from 498 to 573 K. Mejdell et al.20 investigated the inhibition effect of 5% CO on H2 permeation at temperatures from 548 to 623 K with a feed pressure of 300 kPa, and the inhibition effect extent even reached more than 90%, then decreased to 60% with increasing temperature.
Although so many works about the inhibition effect of CO on H2 permeation of the Pd membrane have been reported, the inhibition effect extent is always described ambiguously without distinguishing the CP effect and competitive adsorption effect, which is not good for optimization of operation conditions for H2 permeation. In order to study CP and competitive adsorption effects quantitatively, a comprehensive investigation has been performed on the inhibition effect of CO on hydrogen permeation though a 5-μm Pd/Al2O3 composite membrane. The Sieverts-Langmuir (SL) equation is used to account for the adsorption inhibition effect (AIE) on the membrane permeance toward H2 due to the presence of CO. Based on the results obtained in this work, suitable operation conditions for H2 permeation with CO can be provided.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
II.A. Experimental Device
A Pd/Al2O3 tubular composite membrane was prepared by using the chemical-plating method. First, a one-end-closed porous ceramic tube was washed by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and then by water in an ultrasonic bath, which is used as the substrate. Second, the substrate surface was modified by aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] gel to obtain a Al2O3 substrate. Third, the Al2O3 substrate was immersed into acidic stannous chloride (SnCl2) and palladium chloride (PdCl2) solutions successively to seed Pd nuclei on the outer surface of the substrate. Then, the Pd seeds on the outer surface of the substrate were reduced by hydrazine (N2H4) and stabilized by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Last, the Pd/Al2O3 system was calcined at 773 K for 3 h in an inert gas. Finally, the Pd was deposited on the outer surface of porous Al2O3 tubes with an outer diameter of 12.5 mm, a Pd membrane thickness of 5 μm, and an area of 56.5 cm2. The experimental device for the H2 permeation tests is shown in Fig. 1. It was composed of the Pd membrane, heating system, and pipeline. Pure hydrogen was fed from inlet A, and the impurity gases (CO/N2) were fed from inlet B. The permeate gas was transported to outlet C for gas analysis or to outlet D for H2 storage. The retentate gas was discharged through outlet E. Various gas compositions could be introduced into the device by regulating the mass flow controller. The pressures of the feed and permeate sides were controlled by a pressure controller and measured by a pressure transducer. The uncertainty in the pressure measurements was 1 kPa, including uncertainty in the calibration with a standard accurate pressure gauge. The uncertainty of the temperature was 1 K, including uncertainty in the calibration with a mercury thermometer. The relative uncertainty of the flow rate measurements was 0.1%, including uncertainty in the calibration with a soap bubble flowmeter.

II.B. Experimental Procedure
II.B.1. Activation Process
Before the H2 permeation experiment, the Pd membrane was activated by the following steps:
As the temperature increased from room temperature to 623 K, N2 was fed into both the feed side and permeate side.
After the temperature reached the target value, H2 was introduced to the feed side.
When the maximum H2 permeate flux was obtained and stable for a period of time, the activation process was stopped.
II.B.2. Pure Hydrogen Permeation
Pure H2 permeation experiments were carried out at feed pressures ranging from 130 to 200 kPa and temperatures ranging from 623 to 698 K with a constant feed-flow rate of 1000 mL · min−1. The permeate-side pressure was set at 100 kPa in each experiment by the pressure controller.
II.B.3. Mixtures of H2/N2/CO Permeation
Mixtures of H2/N2/CO permeation experiments were performed at feed pressures from 144 to 222 kPa and temperatures from 623 to 698 K with different gas compositions. The feed-flow rates were kept constant at 1000 mL·min−1, and the H2 permeate pressure was set at 100 kPa. Detailed information for the mixtures permeation experiments is listed in Table I. In order to assess the inhibition effect of CO on the H2 permeation, pure H2 permeation experiments were carried out before the mixtures of H2/N2/CO permeation experiments. For the pure H2 permeation experiments, the feed pressures ranged from 130 to 200 kPa at intervals of 10 kPa. For the mixtures permeation experiments, the feed pressures ranged from 144 to 222 kPa at intervals of about 11 kPa to ensure the same H2 partial pressure with that of the pure H2 permeation experiments.

II.C. Theoretical Analysis
II.C.1. Pure Hydrogen Permeation Kinetics Analysis
The H2 permeability follows a solution-diffusion mechanism (Sieverts Law), and the permeate flux JH2 (mol·m−2·s−1) can be calculated by the following equation:
JH 2=Ped(pnH2,feed−pnH2,permeate),(1)
where
Pe = permeability of membrane (mol· m−1·s−1·Pa−n)
d = membrane thickness (m)
pH2,feed, pH2,permeate = H2 partial pressure (Pa) in the feed and permeate side, respectively
n = pressure exponent between 0.5 and 1.
In most cases, n is estimated to be 0.5 due to the limiting step of hydrogen atom diffusion through the Pd lattice of the bulk membrane. Since permeability is a temperature-dependent parameter that follows an Arrhenius equation, the apparent activation energy Ea of permeation can be determined by using the equation
lnPe=lnP0−EaRT,(2)
where
P0 = maximum permeability at infinitely high temperatures
T = temperature
R = gas constant.
II.C.2. The CO Inhibition Effect Analysis
A recent work indicates that the H2 flux through the Pd membrane is not inhibited by the competition adsorption of N2 (Ref. 21). So, the H2 flux reduction by the addition of N2 to H2 can only be attributed to the CP effect. The inhibition effect extent caused by the CP effect can be described quantitatively as
CP=1−JH2/N 2JH2,(3)
where JH2/N2 is the permeated H2 flux in the presence of N2 and JH2 is that of pure H2 permeation under the same conditions. Then a certain amount of N2 was replaced with an equal amount of CO to characterize the inhibition effect of CO. The total inhibition effect (TIE) extent of CO can be calculated as
TIE=1−JH2/N 2/COJH2,(4)
where JH2/N2/CO is the permeated H2 flux in the presence of N2 and CO. Since the binary diffusion coefficient of H2/N2 is similar to that of H2/CO (Ref. 22), replacing N2 with an equal amount of CO would not lead to a significant change in the CP effect. So, the further H2 flux reduction of H2/N2/CO relative to that of H2/N2 was caused by the competitive adsorption of CO. Therefore, the competitive AIE can be calculated by the following equation:
AIE=TIE−CP.(5)
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
III.A. The H2/N2 Selectivity
Before all the experiments, the H2/N2 selectivity was determined by passing the H2/N2 gas mixtures (1:1) to the Pd membrane. The ratio of H2 permeation flux to N2 permeation flux was calculated. At 623 K, the H2/N2 selectivities were 37640, 18347, and 7935 for H2 pressure drops of 50, 200, and 350 kPa, respectively. This means that the Pd membrane prepared in this work is dense and nearly defect free.
III.B. Pure Hydrogen Permeation
The plots of JH2 versus Δp for pure H2 permeation at temperatures ranging from 623 to 698 K are shown in Fig. 2. The data display a good linear relation with R2 higher than 0.99. The permeability Pe of H2 through the membrane is 4.99 × 10−9, 5.61 × 10−9, 6.30 × 10−9, and 6.81 × 10−9 mol· m−1·s−1·Pa−0.5 for 623, 648, 673, and 698 K, respectively, which is compared with other works23–28 in Table II. For the pure Pd membrane, the permeability ranges from about 3 × 10−9 to 13 × 10−9 mol·m−1·s−1·Pa−0.5. According to the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy Ea is determined to be 15.16 kJ/mol from the linear fitting between lnPe and 1/T, which is shown in Fig. 3. The value of Ea is within the ranges reported in the literature.29

III.C. Mixtures of H2/N2/CO Permeation
III.C.1. Inhibition Effect Analysis
In order to study the influence of pressure on the inhibition effect of CO, mixtures of H2/N2/CO permeation experiments were carried out at a fixed temperature of 623 K and different H2 partial pressure drops (Δp = 30 to 100 kPa). As shown in Fig. 4a, the inhibition extents resulting from CP at 0% CO increase with increasing feed pressures. This phenomenon is consistent with the results in the literature.30 First, the higher the pressure (higher driving force) the higher the permeate flux. It leads to a higher hydrogen composition gradient. Second, a higher pressure means a lower diffusion coefficient, leading to a lower mass transfer coefficient. The two factors result in a thicker boundary layer, which causes the CP extent increasing.31 After replacing a certain amount of N2 with an equal amount of CO, the values of the TIE increase with increasing the additional amount of CO (see Fig. 4a). However, the values of the TIE for 5% CO decrease with increasing feed pressure, which is not consistent with those of 1% and 3% CO. So, the AIE extents are calculated by Eq. (5) and displayed in Fig. 4b. For 1% CO, the values of the AIE are small and almost the same under different feed pressures. For 3% and 5% CO, the values of the AIE are larger than those of 1% CO and decrease with increasing feed pressure. The reduction of the AIE at higher pressures can be ascribed to the catalytic ability of the Pd membrane. The conversion of CO to CH4 (CO + 3H2 = CH4 + H2O) over Pd is well known,32 and this reaction is governed by higher pressure.33 In our experiments, CH4 was indeed detected in the retentate gas. So the higher the pressure is, the smaller the competitive AIE is. The proportion of CP and the AIE in the TIE is shown in Fig. 5. As Δp increases from 40 to 100 kPa, the contribution of the AIE for inhibition becomes from 43.4% to 19.8%.

The impact of temperature on the inhibition effect of CO has been studied at fixed H2 partial pressure drops (Δp = 100 kPa) and different temperatures from 623 to 698 K. As shown in Fig. 6a, the inhibition extent caused by CP at 0% CO increases with increasing temperatures. The reason for the influence of temperature on CP should be considered from two points.31 First, a higher temperature can increase the diffusion coefficient to improve mass transfer behavior, which can weaken the CP effect. Second, increasing the temperature leads to enhancing the permeation of H2 and thus the CP effect will become more serious. The two opposite effects together make the inhibition extent increase by increasing temperatures. After adding CO into the gases by replacing an equal amount of N2, the variation trends of the TIE versus temperature are not the same as those with only the CP effect versus temperature. In order to understand what happened, the values of the AIE are shown in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that the adsorption effect of CO becomes weaker obviously at higher temperatures, which causes the TIE to decrease with increasing temperatures. This temperature dependence of the adsorption effect results from the shift of the CO adsorption equilibrium to a higher value at a lower temperature.16 So, increasing the temperature would increase the CP and decrease the CO adsorption effect contradictorily, and finally weaken the TIE of CO in this work. The proportion of CP and the AIE in the TIE is shown in Fig. 7. As temperatures increase from 623 to 698 K, the contribution of the AIE for inhibition becomes from 22.2% to 8.2%.

By the way, a small amount of coke, which may be produced by methane decomposition or reverse Boudouard reaction, was observed after a lot of experiments. It can be eliminated by oxidization, so the inhibition of coke produced on the surface for H2 permeation can be neglected.
III.C.2. Sieverts-Langmuir Model
The presence of surface-adsorbed species like CO lead to deviations in the Sieverts mode. In order to predict the hydrogen flux on the basis of the Sieverts Law, Barbieri et al.34 proposed a new model that couples the Sieverts Law and Langmuir isotherm together to simulate H2 permeation behavior in the presence of CO. The SL model takes into account the proportion of membrane surface inactive for hydrogen permeation caused by CO adsorption. The SL equation can be expressed as
JH2/CO=(1−αKCOpCO1+KCOpCO)JH2,(6)
where
JH2 =
permeated H2 flux neglect with the influence of CO [calculated using Eq. (1)]
pCO =
CO partial pressure
KCO =
adsorption equilibrium constant
α =
additional effects of the adsorbed gas.
To obtain the parameters KCO and α, additional permeation experiments for H2/CO(1%, 3%, 5%) at H2 partial pressure drops of 100 kPa were performed at temperatures from 623 to 698 K; the results are shown in Fig. 8. The relative H2 flux corresponds to the flux in the presence of CO normalized by the pure H2 permeate flux. The experimental data show good agreement with the SL model (solid line is the fitting data), and the SL model parameters are listed in Table III. This means that the CO adsorption on the Pd membrane follows the Langmuir isotherm. The parameter KCOpCO/(1 + KCOpCO) is obtained from the Langmuir isotherm, which stands for the fraction of the membrane surface covered by CO. The parameter α is a reduction factor caused by the linear correlation assumed between the H2 flux decrease and the surface coverage. By using the two parameters and Eqs. (1) and (6), we can calculate the H2 flux for the H2/CO mixtures permeation through the Pd membrane when the amount of CO in H2 is known. If pCO is large enough to reach saturation adsorption, KCOpCO/(1 + KCOpCO) approximately equals 1. If pCO is too small, KCOpCO/(1 + KCOpCO) equals 0.

III.D. Comparison of Data from Different Works
Although the CO inhibition effects on hydrogen permeation have been investigated by many groups,17–20 the results vary widely for different works. Figure 9 shows a comparison of the data of this work with other reported results. It can be clearly seen that the data have been divided into two regions. The inhibition effects are always larger at temperatures lower than 600 K, while they are smaller at temperatures higher than 623 K. Meanwhile, an interesting phenomenon has appeared. In general, the CO inhibition effect becomes smaller when the membrane thickness becomes thicker. The H2 permeation of a thinner membrane depends more on the surface hydrogen dissociation process, which is easily inhibited by adsorption of CO. On the contrary, the H2 permeation of a thicker membrane depends more on hydrogen diffusion in the bulk phase.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Permeation experiments of pure H2 and gas mixtures containing H2/N2/CO have been performed at temperatures ranging from 623 to 698 K and H2 partial pressure drops from 30 to 100 kPa on a Pd/Al2O3 composite membrane. On the basis of the Sieverts Law and Arrhenius equation, the permeability of H2 through the Pd membrane is 4.99 × 10−9, 5.61 × 10−9, 6.30 × 10−9, and 6.81 × 10−9 mol·m−1·s−1·Pa−0.5 for 623, 648, 673, and 698 K, respectively, and the activation energy Ea is determined to be 15.16 kJ/mol. Temperature and pressure influence the diffusion coefficients and hydrogen composition gradients in the boundary layer (altering the permeation flux by changing the permeability and driving force), and the CP appeared to be enhanced by increasing temperature and pressure in this work. Moreover, the CO competitive adsorption effect would be depressed by higher temperatures and higher pressures due to the CO adsorption equilibrium and methanation reaction, respectively. The opposite variation trend of CP and the competitive adsorption effect against temperature or pressure leads to the impacts of pressure and temperature on the inhibition effects of CO for H2 permeation complicatedly. Additionally, the SL model is used to simulate H2 permeation behavior to predict the hydrogen flux in the presence of CO. On the basis of results obtained in this work, a thicker Pd membrane is preferred to be used, and the operation conditions are generally suggested to be at a higher temperature and a higher pressure when CO is contained in the hydrogen to be purified.
