<Section>Abstract</Section>
In this paper, coupled governing equations were proposed to simulate three-dimensional heat conduction and moisture transport in the nuclear waste repository. Because there will be a large temperature gradient near inner and outer boundaries of the bentonite buffer layer, and the heat driven moisture transport is introduced in the governing equation of moisture transport. By applying the Fourier and Laplace transforms, the governing equations were converted to the Bessel equations, and the Laplace-domain solutions to temperature and moisture distributions were derived through the inverse Fourier transform. The reliability of the proposed solutions was verified through comparative analysis with the line heat source model. These analytical solutions were applied to obtain the evolutions of temperature field and moisture distribution near the waste canister. Finally, a sensitivity study was performed to analyze the effects of relevant parameters on the heat driven moisture transport.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
With the long-term operation of nuclear power plants in many countries around the world, more and more high-level radioactive wastes need to be disposed safely. At present, the deeply geological disposal repository is the most appropriate method (Ye et al., 2009). Construction of deeply geological repository consists of natural and engineered barrier systems. The bentonite buffer layer, which is an important part of the engineered barrier system for the nuclear waste repository, conducts the heat released from the nuclear waste toward the host rock and protects the waste canisters from the intrusion of groundwater (Kim et al., 2011). The host rock serves as a natural barrier system and provides carriers for storing the nuclear waste. The multi-barriers system operates under complex conditions because of the coupling of heat released from the waste canister, the groundwater infiltrated from the host rock, the stress generated by overburden pressures and expansion of the bentonite barrier layer. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical (T-H-M) analysis in the bentonite buffer layer.
The T-H-M processes are coupled with each other strongly, and are difficult to analyze (Lee et al., 2014). Some computer simulation programs have been developed (Cho et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2009, Gens et al., 2009), and the validation of the developed programs was carried out by comparing with laboratory or in situ test results (Lee et al., 2008, SKB, 2012, Nagra, 2011, Yao and Zhou, 2013). However, the analytical methods based on the T-M/T-H/T-H-M models are rare. Some linear assumptions, for instance, the thermal parameters of the buffer materials and host rock and the density and viscosity of water are constant, can provide useful approximations for coupled problems firstly. The complex coupling problem can be studied by analytical methods under these assumptions, and the effect of various parameters can be easily assessed without conducting extensive numerical works (Hökmark and Claesson, 2005). In addition, analytical solutions are also usually used to verify numerical solutions (Kim et al., 2018, Ikonen, 2003, Ikonen, 2005). Therefore, simplified analytical solutions of coupled T-M/T-H/T-H-M problems in the bentonite buffer layer are valuable. As the groundwater infiltrates the thermal conductivity of bentonite increases gradually, and a coupled T-H problem is introduced through this correlation in many numerical works. This nonlinear coupling makes it difficult to obtain the analytical solutions and this type of coupling is not considered here. The bentonite buffer layer has an extremely low permeability coefficient (10−10–10−14 m/s) because of the high dry density and the thermal conductivity of the bentonite buffer layer is significantly lower than those of the waste canister and host rock (Ye et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019). There will be a large temperature gradient near inner and outer boundaries of the bentonite buffer layer. Therefore, the moisture transport driven by the heat conduction may become significant, and this type of coupling is analyzed here. To simplify the coupling problem, only the T-H coupled process is taken into account in this work. Furthermore, the moisture transport in the host rock is not considered. The heat conduction exists in the bentonite buffer layer and host rock, while the moisture transport is only limited in the bentonite buffer layer.
In this paper, a mathematical model is established to simulate the heat conduction and moisture transport at the repository site. The governing equations are converted to the Bessel equations through applying the Fourier and Laplace transforms. The Laplace-domain solutions to temperature and moisture distributions are derived by using the inverse Fourier transform. The temperature and moisture distributions near the waste canister are presented. Finally, the influences of relevant parameters on the heat driven moisture transport are analyzed.
<Section>2. Analytical model</Section>
2.1. Governing equations
Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the thermal–hydraulic analysis model. The following assumptions are made for establishing the governing equations. (1) The thermal and hydraulic parameters of buffer material and host rock are constant. (2) Due to the low permeability of the buffer materials and host rock, the heat transfer caused by the radiation and convection can be negligible (Thunvik and Braester, 1991, Hartley et al., 2006). Heat conduction is the main way of heat transfer. (3) The bentonite buffer layer and host rock are homogeneous and isotropic. The previous numerical simulation results show that the peak temperature of the bentonite buffer layer is about 0.6 °C higher than that if the difference in thermal conductivity between backfill material and rock is not considered, when that the thermal conductivities of host rock and backfill material are 2.72 and 1.0 W/(K·m) (Kristensson and Hökmark, 2007). In order to simplify the mathematical model, the difference in thermal conductivity between the backfill material and rock is ignored.

where, θ is volumetric moisture content, DθT is the thermal moisture diffusivity (m2/(s·°C)), and Dθ is the moisture diffusivity (m2/s).
2.2. Boundary and initial conditions
2.2.1. Thermal boundary and initial conditions
The initial temperature is set to t0 on the ground surface of the repository in Beishan in China. The temperature gradient of 0.024°C/m used in the following analysis comes from in situ tests (Wang, 2007). The initial conditions are written as
@(4)
The heat flux on the upper and lower surfaces of the waste canister only accounts for 0.09 of the total heat fluxes on the outer surface of the waste canister (Zhou et al., 2020) and is neglected in order to obtain the analytical solution to temperature distribution. The condition at the inner boundary of bentonite buffer layer is given by

2.2.2. Hydraulic boundary and initial conditions
It is assumed that the initial moisture distribution θ0 in the buffer layer is uniform. Then the initial distribution of moisture content in the buffer layer is given by
@(12)
The moisture contents at the top and bottom boundaries in the z-coordinate direction are given by
@(13)
The hydraulic boundary condition at the rock wall is simulated by exponential growth function.
@(14)
where θs is saturated volumetric moisture content of the buffer layer, θ0 is an initial volumetric moisture content of the buffer layer and α is a parameter depending on the saturation time of the bentonite buffer layer at the outer radius. The saturation time is assumed as 10 years here (corresponding to α of 2.559 × 10−8).
Another auxiliary condition is that the increase of the moisture in the buffer layer is equal to the moisture injected into it at the rock wall. The condition takes the form as
@(15)
where γ is the radian.
2.3. Laplace-domain solutions
The governing Eqs. (1), (2), (3) of heat conduction and moisture transport are transformed to the Bessel equations by using the Fourier and Laplace transforms, and the Laplace-domain solutions to the temperature and moisture distributions are derived through the inverse Fourier transform. These solutions to temperature distributions in the bentonite buffer layer and host rock are, respectively, given by

The detailed derivations of Eqs. (16), (17), (18) are shown in Appendix A, and the concrete forms of the relevant parameters in Eqs. (16), (17), and (18) are listed in Nomenclature.
2.4. Determination of relevant parameters
2.4.1. Geometric parameters
The repository depth is set as 500 m. When the rock thickness of the model area (L in the Fig. 1) is too small, there may be boundary effects. Because there is no effect of the boundary when the top and bottom of the model area extends to more than 200 m from the repository location (Cho et al., 2014, JNC, 1999), the rock thickness of the model area is selected as 1000 m to eliminate this effect. The buffer layer thickness is set as 0.3 m. The detailed geometric parameters are determined according to the conceptual design of the repository in Olkiluoto in Finland (Ikonen, 2003, Ikonen, 2005), and are shown in Table 1.
Table 1. The geometric parameter values.
2.4.2. Thermal parameters
The initial density of Gaomiaozi (GMZ) bentonite, which is planned to be used as a buffer material in China, at the deposition stage is set to ρ1 = 1770 kg/m3 (corresponding to the dry density of 1600 kg/m3 and moisture content of 10.7%). The thermal conductivity of 0.68 W/(K·m) and the specific heat of 1014 J/(K·kg) are adopted from the data obtained by Xu et al. (2019). The thermal conductivity of rock in Olkiluoto has been studied by Kukkonen (2000). The thermal conductivity of 2.50 W/(K·m) and the specific heat of 832 J/(K·kg) are selected. The rock density is ρ2 = 2630 kg/m3. The initial temperature on the ground surface is 10 °C. The detailed thermal parameters are presented in Table 2.
Table 2. The thermal parameter values.
2.4.3. Hydraulic parameters
The water retention behavior of GMZ bentonite has been studied by Ye et al. (2012), as present in Fig. 2. It can be seen from the figure that the water retention behavior of GMZ bentonite is less affected by temperature. The initial volumetric moisture content of GMZ bentonite can be calculated by Equation (19).
@(19)
where θ0, θr, and θs are the initial, residual and saturated volumetric moisture contents, φc is the air entry value, φ0 is the initial suction. The saturated and residual gravimetric moisture contents of the bentonite are 25% and 5%, respectively. The initial dry density of the bentonite buffer ρd is selected as 1600 kg/m3 and the corresponding saturated and residual volumetric moisture contents of the bentonite are 40% and 8%, respectively. The air entry value is about 10 MPa and the initial suction is determined as 100 MPa by assuming that the bentonite blocks are compacted under the natural water content of 10.7%. Therefore, the initial volumetric moisture content of the bentonite buffer layer can be calculated as 8%.
Fig. 2. Water retention curves of GMZ bentonite at different temperatures (Ye et al., 2012).
The moisture diffusivity in the buffer layer can be determined by the Equation (20).
@(20)
where Ks (m/s) is the hydraulic conductivity of GMZ bentonite at saturation and γw is a unit weight of water. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of GMZ bentonite has been studied by Wen (2006), as listed in Table 3. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is selected as 3.61 × 10−13 m/s at a density of 1600 kg/m3 and temperature of 60 °C. Then, the moisture diffusivity in the buffer layer is calculated as 1.128 × 10−9 m2/s and the thermal moisture diffusivity in the buffer layer is assumed as 2.256 × 10−11 m2/(s·°C) (corresponding to δ (=DθT/Dθ) of 0.02). The detailed hydraulic parameters are listed in Table 4.
Table 3. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of GMZ bentonite.
Table 4. The hydraulic parameter values.
2.4.4. Decay power parameters of nuclear waste
The nuclear waste to be disposed is assumed as SVEA 96 type. The nuclear waste content stored in each waste canister is 2.12 tons. The burnup value of nuclear waste is 38 MWd/kgU and the cooling time is 40 years. The initial heat flux is 1545 W. t1 = 20, t2 = 50, t3 = 200, t4 = 500, t5 = 2000, t6 = 5000, t7 = 20000 and a1 = 0.049, a2 = 0.696, a3 = −0.059, a4 = 0.271, a5 = 0.027, a6 = −0.010, a7 = 0.026 (SKB, 1999a, SKB, 1999b). The detailed parameters of nuclear waste are shown in Table 5.
Table 5. The values of decay power parameters.
2.5. Verification of the present model
The thermal analysis of the repositories in Finnish and Swedish have been carried out by using the line heat source model (Hökmark and Fälth, 2003, Ikonen, 2003, Ikonen, 2005, Hökmark et al., 2009). The waste canister is simplified as a line heat source with a finite length. At the same time, the effect of the difference in the thermal diffusivity between the buffer layer and host rock was not considered. Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram of the line heat source model. The temperature in the host rock is given by
@(21)
where z0 is the vertical distance from the center point (ó) of the line heat source (z0 is selected as 0 m in the later verification), and erf(·) is the error function.
Fig. 3. Schematic diagram of the line heat source model.
The Crump algorithm (1976) is used to calculate the time-domain results. The parameters used in the comparative analysis are presented in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. Fig. 4 shows the temperature increment at the outer radius of bentonite buffer layer for different models. The peak temperature increments are 30.34 °C calculated by the present model in this paper and 28.11 °C calculated by the line heat source model. Because the waste canister with specific dimensions is simplified as a line heat source and the difference in the thermal diffusivity between the bentonite block and host rock was not considered, the calculated temperatures in line heat source model is lower than that of the present model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the result of temperature distribution calculated by the present model are reliable and the present model can simulate the temperature field in the repository more accurately.
Fig. 4. Comparison of the temperature at the outer radius of buffer layer.
To analyze the moisture distribution in the bentonite buffer layer, the first issue that needs to be clarified is the time to reach saturation for the bentonite buffer layer (Ye et al., 2009). The saturation process of the bentonite buffer layer is complicated and mainly depends on the hydro-geochemical parameters of buffer materials and near-field rock (Posiva, 2006). However, the hydraulic-mechanical mechanism of bentonite buffer layer to reach saturation is not clear according to the current research results. The predicted saturation time ranges from several years to several hundred years (Börgesson et al. 2006). Therefore, the verification of the analytical solution of moisture distribution is not considered.
<Section>3. Temperature and moisture distributions near the waste canister</Section>
3.1. Temperature distribution
Fig. 5 presents the temperature distribution near the waste canister. Fig. 5(a) indicates that the temperatures at different radii have a similar pattern, that is, the temperature increases quickly in the early stage of deposition, and reaches the maximum temperature at about 10 years, then decreases slowly with time. The closer the observation point is to the waste canister, the higher the temperature is. The temperature is highest at the middle of the waste canister, and lower at the top and bottom locations, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Fig. 5(c) shows that the temperature at the center line of adjacent waste canister is the lowest and reaches the highest temperature on the canister surface.
Fig. 5. Evolution of temperature near the waste canister.
3.2. Moisture distribution
Fig. 6 shows the moisture distribution near the waste canister. Fig. 6(a) shows that the closer the location near the canister, the slower the volumetric moisture content increases. At the early time of the deposition, the volumetric moisture content near the waste canister becomes lower compared with the initial state because of the release of heat from the canister. In other word, there is the “drying effect” near the canister comparing with the location near the rock wall. The volumetric moisture content is the lowest at the canister middle, and the moisture distributions at the vertical direction along the waste canister are almost symmetrical, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Fig. 6(c) shows that the moisture gradient within the radius of 0.525–0.675 m is 20.21%/m and that within the radius of 0.675 m to 0.825 m is 60.61%/m at the 365 days. There is a large moisture gradient near the rock wall compared with it at locations near the canister.
Fig. 6. Evolution of volumetric moisture content near the waste canister.
<Section>4. Parametric study</Section>
The coupling of moisture transport driven by heat conduction is introduced in the governing equation of moisture transport. In order to understand this type of coupling in depth, the influences of relevant parameters, especially thermal parameters, on the heat driven moisture transport were analyzed.
4.1. Thickness of buffer layer
Fig. 7 presents the effect of the buffer layer thickness (dp = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m) on the moisture distributions at the inner radius of buffer layer. The figure indicates that the thinner the buffer layer is, the smaller the drying effect is in the buffer near the canister, and the faster the groundwater transport to the canister, i.e., the shorter the time it takes for the buffer layer to reach saturation. This is mainly because that the permeability coefficient of the bentonite buffer layer is relatively low and the increase of the buffer layer thickness will cause the saturation time to become longer at the inner radius of buffer layer.
Fig. 7. Evolution of volumetric moisture content for different thickness of the buffer layer.
4.2. Thermal conductivity of bentonite
Fig. 8(a) represents the evolution of moisture distribution for different bentonite’s thermal conductivities caused by changes in water content (0.37, 0.52, 0.68, 0.95, and 1.12 W/(K·m), corresponding to water contents of 0.8%, 5.4%, 10.7%, 14.5%, and 19.4% at the temperature of 60 °C (Xu et al., 2019)). Fig. 8(a) shows that the thermal conductivity of bentonite has great effect on moisture transport at the early stage. As the thermal conductivity of bentonite decreases, the more obvious the drying effect is. This is mainly because the smaller the thermal conductivity is, the more slowly the heat releases outward and the higher the temperature is in the buffer layer, resulting in a lower volumetric moisture content of buffer layer near the canister. Fig. 8(b) represents the evolution of moisture distribution for different bentonite’s thermal conductivities caused by changes in temperature (0.66, 0.67, 0.68, 0.77, and 0.84 W/(K·m), corresponding to temperatures of 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C, and 90 °C at the water content of 10.7% (Xu et al., 2019)). Fig. 8(b) shows that the thermal conductivity of bentonite changes little when the temperature is lower than 60 °C, which has no significant effect on the distribution of volumetric moisture content. However, when the temperature is higher than 60 °C, the thermal conductivity of bentonite increases greatly with increasing the temperature, resulting in smaller drying effect near the canister.
Fig. 8. Evolution of volumetric moisture content for different thermal conductivities of bentonite.
4.3. Thermal conductivity of rock
Fig. 9 presents the effects of the rock thermal conductivities (2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9 W/(K·m)) on moisture evolution. The figure shows that as the thermal conductivity λ2 of the rock decreases, the drying effect becomes obviously in the buffer layer. This is because a smaller λ2 in the rock results in a higher temperature, and thus results in a lower volumetric moisture content in the buffer layer near the canister, but such drying effect is not so significant from Fig. 9.
Fig. 9. Evolution of volumetric moisture content for different thermal conductivities of rock.
4.4. Moisture and thermal moisture diffusivities of buffer material
Fig. 10 investigates the effect of moisture diffusivity of buffer material on the moisture distribution. The buffer material with parameter Dθ = 6.01 × 10−10 m2/s, 1.12 × 10−9 m2/s, 1.78 × 10−9 m2/s (corresponding to saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1.94 × 10−13 m/s at 25°C, 3.61 × 10−13 m/s at 60 °C, 5.75 × 10−13 m/s at 90 °C, respectively, as shown in Table 3) is considered. As seen in the figure, the larger moisture diffusivity has greater drying effect at the early stage. The reason is that the moisture transports toward the rock wall driven by the heat released from the canister and the larger Dθ of buffer material is, the faster the moisture transports outward. However, the buffer layer with a larger Dθ is saturated faster as the intrusion of groundwater from the surrounding rock. The moisture diffusivity of buffer material is affected not only by its saturated hydraulic conductivity, but also by its water retention capacity and initial state according to Eq. (20). Therefore, the accurate determinations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity of buffer material under different conditions (temperature, dry density, etc.) is the key to understand the moisture transport in the buffer layer. Fig. 11 presents the moisture performance respectively for the thermal moisture diffusivities of 2.256 × 10−11, 4.512 × 10−11 and 6.768 × 10−11 m2/(s·°C) (corresponding to δ (=DθT/Dθ) of 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06 respectively) for the buffer material. The figure shows that when the buffer material has larger thermal moisture diffusivity (i.e., the greater the effect of temperature on the moisture transport is), the drying is obvious in the buffer layer near the heat source compared with smaller thermal moisture diffusivity (Li et al., 2003).

<Section>5. Conclusions</Section>
A mathematical model was established to predict the temperature distribution and moisture transport when all the nuclear waste canisters are disposed at the repository site. By applying the Fourier and Laplace transforms, the governing equations were converted to the Bessel equations. These analytical solutions to temperature and moisture distributions were derived by using the inverse Fourier transform. The validity of the present model was verified through comparative analysis with existing line heat source model. Several important conclusions can be drawn from obtained solutions. The closer the observation point is to the waste canister, the higher the temperature is. The temperature is highest at the middle of the waste canister, and lower at the top and bottom locations. The moisture distributions at the vertical direction along the waste canister are almost symmetrical. There is the “drying effect” near the canister comparing with the locations near the rock wall. As the thermal conductivities of bentonite and rock decrease, the more obvious the drying effect is. In addition, the thickness of bentonite buffer layer, and moisture and thermal moisture diffusivities of bentonite also have a significant effect on the moisture transport. The heat driven moisture transport is important and should not be neglected.
