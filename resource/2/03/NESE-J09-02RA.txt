Attached bubble and detached bubble regimes were observed in vertical downward jet.
•
The pressure oscillation amplitude of attached bubble regime was less than 1 kPa.
•
Two correlations of pressure oscillation frequency were presented considering buoyancy.
<Section>Abstract</Section>
The influence of buoyancy on pressure oscillation amplitude and frequency was studied with two steam jet directions in the range of steam mass flux 8.34–50.13 kg/(m2·s) and water temperature 40–85 °C. At small steam mass flux, the steam bubble pattern of vertical downward jet is attached bubble regime because the direction of steam momentum and buoyancy are opposite. The pressure oscillation frequency is less than 20 Hz, and the pressure oscillation amplitude is less than 1 kPa, which is much smaller than that for a vertical upward jet. It is conducive to the safety of relevant equipment. For the rough grown detached bubble regime, due to the influence of buoyancy, on the pressure oscillation frequency of vertical downward jet is smaller than that of vertical upward jet. Two dimensionless correlations of the pressure oscillation frequency were presented considering the influence of buoyancy. The prediction errors are within ±11%.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Phase change heat transfer is widely used in all kinds of industrial equipment, such as air conditioning system [1], [2], solar power plant [3] and so on. The steam-water direct contact condensation is widely used in nuclear reactor safety systems [4]. For example, when the coolant loss accident occurs, lots of steams with high pressure and temperature are injected into the subcooled water through sparger to release heat and pressure. At the end stage of pressure relief process with low mass flux, the Bubbling and Chugging regimes will occur. However, in Bubbling and Chugging regimes, the pressure oscillations are characterized by low frequency and high amplitude, which may resonate and destroy relevant equipment. Therefore, the study on the pressure oscillation characteristics in Chugging and Bubbling regimes is really helpful to the safety of relevant equipment.
In recent decades, many studies were conducted on the steam-water condensation flow patterns and pressure oscillation. For the vertical downward steam jet, Chen and Lee [5], Gregu et al. [6], and Aya et al. [7], [8] developed 2D condensation regime map. Chun et al. [9], Cho et al. [10] and Chong et al. [11] developed 2D condensation regime map for the horizontal steam jet. Yang et al. [12] and Tang et al. [13] developed 2D condensation regime map for vertical upward steam jet. Petrovic de With et al. [14] developed a 3D condensation regime map taking the nozzle diameter into consideration. The steam-water interface was used to identify flow patterns, namely, Chugging, Bubbling and Jetting. Then, Wu et al. [15] studied the steam plume shape with five nozzle diameters. Xu et al. [16] developed a 3D condensation regime map in a vertical pipe, the velocity of water was taken into account for the condensation regime. Recently, Zhao et al. [4] reviewed the existing regime map and found that the flow patterns were quite different under low steam mass flux in different injection directions.
For the Jetting regime, the pressure oscillation has small amplitude and high frequency. Hong et al. [17] indicated that steam plume length periodic variations could induce pressure oscillations. Qiu et al. [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] and Chong et al. [24] studied the heat transfer coefficient and pressure oscillation characteristics systematically. They found the steam heat transfer coefficient was related with the first dominant frequency. In addition, the second dominant frequency was observed under some conditions. For the Chugging and Bubbling regime, the pressure oscillation has low frequency and large amplitude. Youn et al. [25] and Tang et al. [26] exposed the mechanism of pressure oscillation experimentally. Youn et al. [25] found the pressure pulse was occurred at the moment of bubble detached. However, Tang et al. [26] found the pressure pulse was generated when the bubble collapse. Additionally, Song et al. [27] investigated steam bubble condensation process by numerical simulation and found the pressure pulse was generated when the bubble collapse. Chong et al. [11], Youn et al. [25], Damasio et al. [28], and Simpson et al. [29] studied the pressure oscillation frequency in the Chugging and Bubbling regime. In our previous study [12], the pressure oscillation frequency under upward steam jet was compared with those results of Chan and Lee [5]. It was speculated that buoyancy affects the pressure oscillation frequency. However, the extent of the influence of buoyancy on the pressure oscillation frequency is not yet clear due to the limited experimental data.
In summary, there is rarely experimental study about the buoyancy influence on pressure oscillation characteristics in Bubbling and Chugging regimes. Therefore, in order to quantitative analyze the influence of buoyancy on the pressure oscillation characteristics and find the key technology to regulate the condensation pressure oscillation in low steam mass flux, a series of experimental studies at low steam mass flux (8.34–50.13 kg/(m2·s)) have been conducted in two jet directions. According to the results, the pressure oscillation frequency of vertical downward jet decreases obviously due to the influence of buoyancy, and the pressure oscillation amplitude is less than 1 kPa, which is more beneficial to the safe and stable operation of the equipment.
<Section>2. Experimental system and data processing</Section>
2.1. Experimental system
The experimental system schematic is shown in Fig. 1. The power of the electric boiler was 12 kW. A surge tank was used to stabilize the steam pressure. In the experiment, two flowmeters (range of 0.336–3.36 kg/h and 3–10 kg/h, respectively) were used to measure the steam flow. The accuracy of two flowmeters was 1.5% full span. The visual tank sizes were 400 × 400 × 500 mm. A T-type thermocouple (±0.5 K) was applied to measure the steam temperature before nozzle inlet. A pressure transducer (range of 0–200 kPa and accuracy of 0.2% full span) was applied to measure the steam pressure before nozzle inlet. Four T-type thermocouples were equipped on the probes at l = 40 mm and h = 60, 100, 140, 180 mm, respectively, where, l was the length from the central axis of the tank and h was the height from the bottom of the tank. In the experiment, the water temperature was defined as the average temperature of the four thermocouples. A copper cooler and an electric heater were applied to control and maintain water temperature. The water temperature deviation was lower than 0.3 K during sample time. A high speed video camera was applied to record the steam bubble shape. The photo sample rate was 10,000 frames per seconds. During the shooting process, the camera was shooting perpendicular to the water tank plane, so the influence of the visual window on the shooting can be ignored.
Fig. 1. Schematic of the experimental system.
For vertical downward jet, the nozzle outlet was 100 mm away from the bottom of the visual tank. The water pressure oscillation signals were collected by a dynamic pressure sensor (range of −60–60 kPa and accuracy of 0.2% full span). The dynamic pressure sensor (P1) was installed in the visual tank on the axial distance of 40 mm and radial distance of 40 mm from the nozzle outlet. The water static pressures of nozzle outlet were the same both for the vertical upward and downward steam jet. The experimental parameters are listed in Table 1.
2.2. Image data processing and uncertainty
2.2.1. Image data processing
The obtained images were processed by MATLAB. Detailed image processing was introduced in previous study [12]. The bubble edge features were obtained by using winner filter, intensity filter, dilate filter and erode filter. The binary images were obtained by the Otsu’s [30] method. The bubbles were filled completely by the regional calibration method and the “imfill” function of MATLAB. All bubble cross-sections were assumed as circular. Therefore, the obtained 2D binary images were used to calculate the bubble volumes, which could be expressed as follows:
@(1)
The equivalent radius of a sphere with the same volume was regarded as the bubble radius, and it could be expressed as follows:
@(2)
where Vb is the volume of the bubble, K is a scale factor, Ω is the aggregation of all rows of the bubble and di is the pixels contained in the row i of the bubble.
2.2.2. Repeatability and uncertainty
In order to test the repeatability of experimental results, the experiments at subcooling degree ΔTsub = 25 K were conducted twice, as shown in Fig. 2. It indicated that the experimental results had a good repeatability.
Fig. 2. Repeatability of experiment.
The uncertainties of the experimental date were evaluated by the uncertainty propagation analysis [31]. If , then the uncertainty of uf was  The temperature recording accuracy of the data acquisition system was less than 0.25 K, and the accuracy of the T–type thermocouple was 0.5 K. Therefore, the temperature measuring accuracy was less than 0.56 K. The minimum subcooling degree was 15 K, so the uncertainty in calculating the subcooling degree was 3.73%. The uncertainty of steam mass flux was 4.85%. The uncertainty of pressure oscillation frequency was 4.07%. The bubble volume measuring error was mostly relevant to image measurement (1 pixel) and the bubble horizontal cross-sections were circular [13]. The error of the image measurement was less than 3.09%. The error of the assumption that each row was cylinder was less than 5%. Therefore, the bubble volume measuring error was less than 5.88%. Thus, the bubble volume radius error was less than 1.96%. According to the expression of dimensionless number, the uncertainty of Re, Ja, St and Eo were 4.85%, 3.73%, 6.45% and 3.92%, respectively.
<Section>3. Experimental results and discussion</Section>
3.1. The influence of buoyancy on bubble behavior
3.1.1. Chugging
Chugging regime is defined as subcooled water enters the nozzle intermittently. Fig. 3 shows the condensation behavior of Chugging in two steam jet directions. The bubble behavior in two jet directions are basically the same, including water discharging from the nozzle, bubble formation, bubble collapse, and water backflow. The influence of buoyancy on bubble behavior in Chugging regime is really small.

3.1.2. Bubbling
For the vertical upward steam jet, according to whether the bubble surface is smooth or not in bubble grown stage [33] (before necking process), the bubbling regime is divided into smooth grown detached bubble regime and rough grown detached bubble regime. At small steam mass flux, the steam momentum force is small, the steam-water velocity difference on the interface is small, and the bubble surface is smooth during bubble grown stage, as shown in Fig. 4(a). At large steam mass flux, the steam momentum force is large, the steam-water velocity difference on the interface is large, the interface starts to unstable, and the bubble surface is rough during bubble grown stage, as shown in Fig. 4(b).

Figs. 5 and 6 show the condensation behavior of attached bubble and detached bubble regimes according to whether the bubble can detaches from the nozzle. Fig. 7 shows these forces on the steam bubble. The expressions for these forces are as follows:
1)
Fp is the pressure force, and its expression is:
(3)
where ps is the steam pressure at nozzle exit.
2)
Fm is the vapor momentum force, and its expression is:
@(4)
3)
Fs is the surface tension force, and its expression is:
@(5)
4)
Fd is the drag force, and its expression is:
@(6)
where v is bubble velocity, Cd is the drag coefficient. Hibiki and Ishii [32] proposed a formula for calculating the drag coefficient:
@(7)
5)
Fcon is the condensation force, and its expression is:
@(8)
where h is the bubble heat transfer coefficient.

Fb is the buoyancy force, and its expression is:

Fig. 7. Forces on the steam bubble.
The bubble’s resultant force:
@(10)
For the vertical downward steam jet, the buoyancy force and steam momentum force are in the opposite direction. The buoyancy force hinders the bubble’s detachment. Thus, it is noteworthy that there will be a phenomenon that the bubble cannot detach from the nozzle at small steam mass flux for the vertical downward steam jet. For example, when the experimental condition is Gs = 33.17 kg/(m2·s) and ΔTsub = 25 K, the maximum bubble diameter is 33.12 mm. When the bubble grows to the maximum bubble size, it is in the quasi-steady stage, and the drag force can be ignored. The magnitude of each force is calculated based on the experimental results, Fp = 4.61 × 10−2 N, Fm = 9.21 × 10−2 N, Fb = 1.70 × 10−1 N, Fs = 2.44 × 10−3 N, Fcon = 4.91 × 10−4 N. The resultant force Fres < 0, it means that the bubble cannot detach from the nozzle. The flow pattern is attached bubble regime, as shown in Fig. 5(c).
As subcooling degree increases, the maximum bubble diameter decreases, the buoyancy force decrease. For example, when the experimental condition is Gs = 33.17 kg/(m2·s) and ΔTsub = 30 K, the maximum bubble diameter is 27.41 mm. The buoyancy force decrease from 1.70 × 10−1 N to 1.06 × 10−1 N. The resultant force Fres > 0, it means that the bubble can detach from the nozzle, as shown in Fig. 6(a). With the increase of steam mass flux, the steam momentum force increases. The buoyancy force cannot hinder the bubble’s detachment at the higher steam mass flux the flow pattern is the detached bubble regime, as shown in Fig. 6(b). From the Fig. 6, it can also be found that the bubble surface is rough in bubble grown stage (before necking process), the detached bubble regime of the vertical downward steam jet is rough grown detached bubble regime.
For the vertical downward steam jet, the buoyancy direction is opposite to the steam momentum force direction, the steam bubble grows slowly and the bubble is extruded and the vapor–liquid cross-section is larger than that for the vertical upward steam jet. For example, when the steam mass flux is 44.23 kg/(m2·s) and subcooling degree is 25 K, for the vertical downward steam jet, the maximum bubble diameter is 26.96 mm, while, for the vertical upward jet, the maximum bubble radius is 23.86 mm.
According to the characteristics of the above several flow patterns, the entire flow pattern of the vertical downward jet is divided into three regions, which are chugging, attached bubble, and detached bubble (rough growth detached bubble), as shown in Fig. 8. When the subcooling degree is lower than 45 K and the steam mass flux is small, the condensation pattern of vertical downward jet is attached bubble. When the steam mass flux is higher than 25 kg/(m2·s), the flow pattern changes to the detached bubble regime. In our previous study [33], it was found that the decrease of subcooling degree would reduce the heat flux at the vapor-liquid interface, requiring a larger heat transfer area to achieve the balance of condensation capacity at the phase interface, and increase the maximum diameter of the steam bubble. As a result, the bubble buoyancy force increases, and a greater steam momentum is required to make the resultant vertical downward force greater than the vertical upward resultant force, so as to realize the bubble detached from the nozzle. Therefore, the steam flux at the transition point (from attached bubble to detached bubble) increases as the subcooling degree decreases.

3.2. The influence of buoyancy on pressure oscillation amplitude
Fig. 9 shows the original pressure signals with two jet direction. For the vertical upward jet, the steam bubble can detach from the nozzle at ΔTsub = 25 K and Gs = 27.65 kg/(m2·s). The detached bubble condenses rapidly in subcooled water. Therefore, there are significant pressure pulse occur at the moment of bubble collapse, as shown in Fig. 9(a). However, for the vertical downward jet, the bubble cannot detach from the nozzle in the attached bubble regime due to the buoyancy force. Fig. 9(b) and (c) present the original signals of the attached bubble regime. The steam bubble grows at the nozzle and condenses slowly. No significant pressure pulse occurs due to the slow change in bubble volume. Fig. 9(d) shows the original signals of the detached bubble regime for the downward jet at ΔTsub = 25 K and Gs = 50.13 kg/(m2·s). The pressure oscillation amplitude increases significantly when the condensation pattern changes from the attached bubble regime to the detached bubble regime.
Fig. 9. Original pressure signals in two jet directions (ΔTsub = 25 K). (a) Vertical upward (Gs = 27.65 kg/(m2·s)). (b) Vertical downward (Gs = 27.65 kg/(m2·s)). (c) Vertical downward (Gs = 33.17 kg/(m2·s)). (d) Vertical downward (Gs = 50.13 kg/(m2·s)).
In order to estimate pressure oscillation amplitude, the average pressure oscillation amplitude is adopted, which can be expressed as follows:
@(11)
where N — periods number, and T — pressure oscillation period.
The average pressure oscillation amplitudes in different steam jet directions and different bubble regimes are shown in Fig. 10. When the steam jet direction is vertically upward, the condensation pattern is detached bubble regime (smooth grown detached bubble and rough grown detached bubble regimes), the average pressure oscillation amplitude generally increases with increasing steam mass flux. When the steam jet direction is vertically downward, in the case of low steam mass flux and high water temperature, the condensation pattern is attached bubble regime, and the average pressure oscillation amplitude is less than 1 kPa, which is far lower than that of the smooth grown detached bubble regime at the same experimental parameter. Therefore, for the attached bubble regime, the pressure oscillation amplitude is small, which is conducive to the safe and stable operation of the equipment. Thus, the vertical downward steam jet is beneficial to the stable operation of the equipment.
Fig. 10. Average pressure oscillation amplitude in different steam jet directions. (a) Vertical upward. (b) Vertical downward.
From Fig. 10(b), when the condensation pattern changes to the detached bubble regime, it is found that the average pressure oscillation amplitude increases significantly, about 10 times bigger than the attached bubble regime, it is also an important criterion for the flow pattern from the pressure oscillation signal.
3.3. The influence of buoyancy on pressure oscillation frequency
The pressure oscillation frequencies in two jet directions under the bubbling regime are shown in Fig. 11. For the vertical upward jet, the frequency increases rapidly when the condensation pattern changes from the smooth grown detached bubble regime to the rough grown detached bubble regime. For the attached bubble regime of the vertical downward jet, the pressure oscillation frequencies are little affected by the steam mass flux and water temperature, which are all less than 20 Hz. When the condensation pattern changes to the detached bubble regime (rough grown detached bubble regime), the pressure oscillation frequency increases rapidly. The experimental data of Damasio et al. [28] is also shown in the Fig. 11(b), which are agree well with our experimental data.
Fig. 11. Pressure oscillation frequency (Bubbling regime). (a) Vertical upward. (b) Vertical downward.
Fig. 12 presents the influence of buoyance force on pressure oscillation frequencies of Chugging and Bubbling regimes. For the Chugging regime, the pressure oscillation frequencies with two jet directions increase with the increasing steam mass flux, as shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b). There is no obvious difference in the pressure oscillation frequencies of two jet directions, because most of the steam condenses in the tube, and the buoyancy effect is not obvious.
Fig. 12. Comparison of pressure oscillation frequency of two jet directions (a) ΔTsub = 60 K. (b) ΔTsub = 50 K. (c) ΔTsub = 40 K. (d) ΔTsub = 30 K.
At large steam mass flux (Gs ≥ 22.12 kg/(m2·s)) and low subcooling degree (ΔTsub ≤ 45 K), the condensation pattern is rough grown detached bubble regime. For the vertical upward steam jet, the buoyancy force and steam momentum force are in the same direction. Thus, the buoyancy force contributes to the bubble’s detachment. For the vertical downward steam jet, the buoyancy force and steam momentum force are in the opposite direction. The buoyancy force hinders the bubble’s detachment. Besides, when the buoyancy direction is opposite to the bubble motion direction, such as the vertical downward steam jet, the bubble move velocity is slower, the relative velocity of the vapor-liquid interface is smaller, the convective heat transfer between the bubble and the subcooling water is weaker and the bubble condensation rate is lower. Therefore, the vertical upward jet frequency is larger than that of the vertical downward jet under same experimental parameter, as shown in Fig. 12(c) and (d).
In previous researches [12], [28], [29], the steam mass flux was represented by Reynolds number and the frequency was usually represented by Strouhal number. The pressure oscillation frequencies of two jet directions were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 13. In our previous study [12], the pressure oscillation frequency of the smooth grown detached bubble regime with vertical upward jet was analyzed, and it was found that the value of St decreases with increasing Re. Moreover, a formula was presented to calculate the pressure frequency for smooth grown detached bubble regime. However, the Strouhal number increases with increasing Reynolds number in the rough grown detached bubble regime, which is different with that in smooth grown detached bubble regime.
Fig.13. Strouhal number under different condensation patterns (a) Vertical upward (b) Vertical downward.
Damasio et al. [28] and Simpson et al. [29] gave a frequency prediction correlation for the Chugging regime based on their experiment data in different steam mass flux range, respectively. The previous correlations [12], [28], [29] are used to predict the experimental data in rough grown detached bubble regime, and the comparisons are shown in Fig. 14. These frequency correlations are not applicable for the rough grown detached bubble regime.
Fig. 14. Pressure oscillation frequency in rough grown detached bubble regime predicted by the previous correlations.
From our experimental results, it is found that buoyancy has a considerable effect on the frequency of pressure oscillation. Therefore, the influence of buoyancy is considered in this paper, and the influence of buoyancy is represented by Eo number. Two correlations could be suggested for the rough grown detached bubble regime:
Vertical upward:
@(12)
Vertical downward:
@(13)
where St is Strouhal number (@), Re is Reynolds number (@), Eo is Eotvos number (@) and Ja is water Jacob number (@). The applicable range of Eq. (12) is 22.12 ≤ Gs ≤ 50.13 kg/(m2·s) and 15 K ≤ ΔTsub ≤ 45 K. The applicable range of Eq. (13) is 27.65 ≤ Gs ≤ 50.13 kg/(m2·s) and 15 K < ΔTsub ≤ 45 K.
The predicted results using Eqs. (12) and (13) are shown in Fig. 15. The maximum errors are ±11%.

<Section>4. Conclusions</Section>
The influence of buoyancy on pressure oscillation amplitude and frequency is studied at steam mass flux of 8.34–50.13 kg/(m2·s) and water subcooling degree of 15–60 K. The main conclusions are as follows:
(1)
For the vertical downward jet, a flow regime map is given based on whether the steam bubble can detach from the nozzle. For the attached bubble regime, the pressure oscillation amplitude is less than 1 kPa, which is much smaller than that of the vertical upward jet at the same experimental parameter. Thus, the vertical downward jet is safer than the vertical upward jet at low steam mass flux, which is significant for the relevant equipment design in nuclear power plant.
(2)
For the attached bubble regime, the pressure oscillation frequency is less than 20 Hz. For the rough grown detached bubble regime, due to the influence of buoyancy, the pressure oscillation frequency of vertical downward jet is smaller than that of vertical upward jet.
(3)
Two dimensionless correlations of pressure oscillation frequency are presented for rough grown detached bubble regime considering the influence of buoyancy. The predicted errors are within ±11%.
