<Section>Abstract</Section>
In this work, various non-linear characteristics of the Density-Wave Oscillations and Ledinegg Instability, in a heated channel under supercritical pressure, are explored. Unlike the existing studies which only present the linear stability, this study delineates the vivid bifurcation characteristics of the system, which are still uncharted. It explores the interaction between the Density Wave Oscillations (DWO) and the Ledinegg instability represented by the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. In the obtained stability boundary, three regions display different dynamic behaviors. The first and third region exhibit the characteristics of the DWOs, while the second region shows the Ledinegg instability, which is also confirmed by the negative slope of hydrodynamic characteristic curves. The detailed bifurcation analysis has been carried out in Ledinegg instability region through interaction between internal and external characteristic curve. A comprehensive investigation of the above-said characteristics is also carried-out, in contrast to the conventional identification of stable and unstable operating parameters.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The supercritical fluid shows a peculiar behavior in its thermodynamic properties as its temperature crosses the critical temperature (also known as pseudo-critical temperature) threshold. The heat conduction coefficient and the heat capacity, at constant pressure tends to increase dramatically, while the thermal diffusivity, density and viscosity tend to decrease significantly (Pucciarelli, 2017). Owing to this spectacular change in the fluid properties, high and low density fluid flow waves move across a heated channel and affect the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of the system. This can eventually cause flow and power oscillations (instability), which leads to mechanical vibrations and control problems in the system (Boure et al., 1973; Strogatz, 1994; Zhao, 2005). The real dynamics of fluid flow systems are complex, therefore, several researchers have developed reduced order, simplified lumped parameter models to study the stability characteristics (Dokhane, 2004; Durga Prasad and Pandey, 2008; Paul, 2015; Wahi and Kumawat, 2011). The abundant amount of literature in this area is evidence to the fact that it is essential to study the flow instability phenomena, in order to predict the dynamical behavior of two-phase and supercritical fluid flow systems (Ambrosini, 2007; Mishra and Singh, 2016a; Paul, 2019; Rahman and Singh, 2019; Rizwan-Uddin and Dorning, 1986, Sharma, 2014; Zhao, 2005). Most of these studies are limited to the linear stability analysis, which is valid only for small perturbations. According to bifurcation theory, the change in the system characteristics with smooth changes in the operating parameter values, lead to the appearance of the limit cycle or sudden change in the system dynamics (Strogatz, 1994; Wiggins, 2003). These characteristics form the non-linear phenomena and, hence, are a necessary components in forecasting complete stability behavior of the system. These limit cycles have been observed during stability tests, theoretically as well as, in numerical calculations (Dokhane, 2004; Dutta et al., 2015; Karve, 1998; Mishra and Singh, 2016a; Paul and Singh, 2014a; Rizwan-Uddin and Dorning, 1986; Ruspini, 2013). Earlier such non-linear analysis had been largely carried out for a low-dimensional model as the analysis is computationally expensive. Numerous authors have proposed several reduced order models (ROMs) to qualitatively study the dynamical systems. The developed ROM model reduces the system complexity using certain approximations and assumptions while capturing the essential dynamical characteristics of the systems. In this context, for the reduction of geometry; several authors have modeled complex flow systems (such as reactors) as single and parallel heated channels under uniform and non-uniform heat flux distribution conditions (Dokhane et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2019; Mishra and Singh, 2016b; Paul and Singh, 2017, 2014b; Shitsi et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019, Singh and Singh, 2019). In these systems, the prediction and analysis of Ledinegg excursions flow instability and density-wave oscillations (DWOs) are of paramount interest to researchers, for the last few decades (Debrah et al., 2013; Pandey and Singh, 2017; Rahman and Singh, 2019; Ruspini, 2013).
Recently, several papers have reported detailed discussions of these characteristics for heated channels under supercritical fluid flow conditions. The relevant analogies and dynamical behavior of these systems in context of boiling (two-phase flow) channels were also pointed out (Ambrosini, 2007; Paul, 2019; Rao et al., 2016; Singh and Singh, 2019, Singh, 2020). Ebrahimnia et al. (2016) and Pucciarelli (2017) reported numerical stability characteristics through RANS models using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Ambrosini (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011) and his team (Ampomah-Amoako et al., 2013; Debrah et al., 2013; Sharabi et al., 2008) have reported numerous studies on the stability characteristics of the single heated channel with different fluids at supercritical pressure conditions. They have reported the dynamic and Ledinegg instability, but non-linear dynamics (appearance of limit cycles) in the context of bifurcation characteristics are missing. Therefore with an aim to suffuse the mentioned research-gap, the present work is focused to study the bifurcation characteristics of the heated channel system with supercritical fluid (water) flow conditions.
Following the previous study; the ROM model, which was developed using a straightforward translation concept from a two-phase flow (boiling) channel is used in the present study (Singh et al., 2019) with the same geometry and flow condition. In this model, the nodalization scheme is adopted in such a way that each node position in the heated channel varies automatically during the system evolution. Similar approach was used by Paul and Singh (2015) for channels with two-phase flows. The developed scheme helps to reduce the computational effort while maintaining reasonable accuracy. A numerical continuation bifurcation package MATCONT (Dhooge et al., 2003), which works on a MATLAB environment has been used to study the excursive (or Ledinegg) instability and the density wave oscillations (DWOs). The bifurcation maps in the parametric space have been obtained to indicate the interaction of the excursive instability (Ledinegg instability) with the dynamic instability (DWOs) and vice versa. Paul (2019) also, adopt similar methodology to couple thermal hydraulics with neutron kinetics and reported several non-linear dynamics through bifurcation characteristic.
In the present work, detailed co-dimension analyses have been carried out to capture non-linear (bifurcation) phenomena in a wide range of parametric space, which is not reported in earlier works. In this context, with an aim to suffuse the mentioned research-gap, co-dimensions (1 and 2) analysis has been carried out to capture the oscillatory, as well as, non-oscillatory behavior of the system. The bifurcation (non-linear) analysis with the aid of numerical simulations and the hydrodynamic characteristic curves has led to identification of multiple equilibrium points. The interplay of these equilibrium points has been seen through saddle-node bifurcation. The interaction of various type of instabilities is identified by different type of bifurcations. With the use of MATCONT, the parametric space is divided into different parts showing different physical characteristics of the system. Such details are difficult to identify by numerical simulations alone or linear stability analysis. Since the nonlinear behavior is highly influenced by the size of perturbation in the system, as during real operating conditions, the size of perturbations cannot be controlled precisely. Therefore the present work also focuses on the study of the effect of different sizes of perturbations and captures the corresponding bifurcation characteristics. In addition, a parametric study is done to demonstrate the change of these bifurcation characteristics with the variations of the corresponding operating parameters. Thus rich, peculiar nonlinear dynamic behavior of the various bifurcation phenomena for a supercritical fluid flow system is reported in this paper.
<Section>2. Mathematical background</Section>
The present analysis has been performed using an earlier developed model (called as NROM). In NROM, a single heated channel has been used, and the schematic view of the physical system is shown in Fig. 1. The system design and operating parameters, corresponding to Fig. 1, are defined in Table A.1 (Appendix A). In the earlier work (Singh et al., 2019), a node independence analysis has been carried out and it was seen that six nodes were appropriate for the subsequent analysis. The SCW flow is driven by an applied external pressure drop across the channel. The physical system is mathematically represented by a set of 1-D conservation (mass, energy and momentum balance) PDEs. These dimensional conservation equations are non-dimensionalized by using the appropriate parameters (Ambrosini and Sharabi, 2008) given in Appendix A.

The equation of mass balance in non-dimensional form is written as:

The equation of momentum balance in non-dimensional form is written as:

The non-dimensional energy conservation equation is:

The equation of the state, in a non-dimensional form, is:

In the previous study (Singh et al., 2019), the enthalpy and specific volume are explicitly approximated in consecutive nodes, before applying the weighted residual method in the heated channel as,
@(5)
@(6)
It should be noted that approximation of the specific volume finally leads to an approximation for the density. Since the density variation with the spatial position is known (Eq. (6)), mass balance equation (Eq. (1)) is used at the steady state to get the velocity profile as follow;
(7)
In Eq. (7),  are the approximate phase constants and are defined as follows;
The above mentioned approximate expressions (Eqs. (5), (6), (7)) are substituted in the conservation PDEs (Eqs. (1), (2), (3)). It should be noted that as these are approximate functions, therefore, these result in residual errors. The weighted residual method, which minimizes the residual error, is applied in each consecutive node. Thus, the PDEs (Eqs. (1), (2), (3)) are transformed into time dependent non-linear coupled ODEs. The detailed procedure of converting PDEs into ODEs has been shown in a previous work (Singh et al., 2019).
From the energy balance equation, ODE for enthalpy approximation  constant is obtained as,

In order to obtain ODE for density approximation constant ( the mass balance equation is used which yields,

In order to obtain the final ODE for the inlet velocity, all the pressure drop components for each node are calculated from the momentum equation. These components are added and equated to the applied external pressure drop.

Further rearranging of the terms leads to the ODE for inlet velocity as follows;

Here, the right side of the equations are too complicated with large mathematical expressions, therefore, for convenience of the readers, these values are defined in Appendix B.
<Section>3. Results and discussion</Section>
As discussed earlier, the non-linear stability analysis is important to capture oscillatory behavior as well as sudden change in equilibrium of the system. Therefore, the present analysis is predominantly focused on capturing the non-linear phenomenon in a wide range of parametric space.
3.1. Linear stability analysis
The linear stability of the system is examined by linearizing the non-linear time dependent ODEs (Eqs. (8), (9), (10)) around the steady state in presence of a small perturbation, the linearization is carried out by truncating the Taylor series at first order. Thereby, the Jacobian matrix is obtained and its eigenvalues are evaluated. If all the eigenvalues have negative real parts the system is stable, whereas even one eigenvalue with positive real part makes the system unstable. Based on the behavior of the eigenvalues, the stability threshold has been drawn in a  parametric space as shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2
Fig. 2. Bifurcation stability boundary in parametric  space.
In the unstable region, small perturbations grow with time, and the system does not return to its normal operating condition. However on the stable side, it returns back into its normal operating condition, as any initial perturbation decays with time. To verify the obtained stability boundary (Fig. 2), the time evolution of the system are obtained using ODE45 (inbuilt in MATLAB) in the presence of an initial small perturbation. The points P4, P5, and P6 in Fig. 2 indicate different locations near the stability boundary where the time evolution of inlet velocity has been studied.
The points P4 and P5 being on the unstable and stable side of the stability boundary, respectively, represent expected diverging (growth of perturbation) and damping nature of oscillations, as indicated by the (Fig. 3(a & c)) with time. Similarly, point P6 being on the stability boundary (Fig. 3(b)) shows constant amplitude oscillations. This time evolution behavior analysis confirms the linear stability map shown in Fig. 2.

3.2. Non-linear analysis
As discussed in the previous section, linear stability analysis is not adequate as truncation of higher order term lead to loss of some important information (Dokhane, 2004; Paul and Singh, 2017; Strogatz, 1994; Zhao, 2005). Therefore, non-linear analysis (which includes effect of higher order terms), should be performed for a correct assessment of the system stability. Therefore, for detailed understanding, let us observe the variation of the eigenvalues along the linear stability boundary (Fig. 2). As ROM consists of 2N + 1 (Number of nodes = 6) ODEs, therefore Jacobian has total 13 eigenvalues. The 11 of these eigenvalues are real and negative, and rest of the two eigenvalues can be either real or complex conjugate pair. The plots in Fig. 4, can be seen as consisting of three regions. These region indicate transition from dynamic to Ledinegg characteristics or vice-versa as follows:
•
First region (Hopf bifurcation boundary): For smaller values of Nspc the real part of the eigenvalues is zero i.e. eigenvalues are purely imaginary, as can be seen from Fig. 4(a). Whereas, the imaginary parts of these eigenvalues keep on shifting towards zero along the stability boundary, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This indicates the presence of the Hopf characteristic in the system.
•
Second region (Ledinegg instability): These eigenvalues become real with opposite sign, with same magnitude as one moves along the stability boundary. The real eigenvalues indicate the presence of static (Ledinegg) instability. Furthermore, these pair of eigenvalues first increase and then decrease towards zero.
•
Third region (Hopf bifurcation boundary): These eigenvalues again turn into a pair of complex conjugates which indicates reoccurrence of the Hopf bifurcation boundary.
Fig. 4
Fig. 4. Variation of the eigenvalues along the stability threshold.
The nature of the eigenvalues gives an initial indication that both dynamic and static instability occurs in the system. In this system, the Ledinegg instability regions lies as a sandwich between the first and third region of dynamic instability. Therefore, the next few sub-sections are devoted to a detailed non-linear (bifurcation) analysis on a wide range of parametric space around the density wave oscillations and Ledinegg instability regions.
3.2.1. Dynamic instability analysis
Based on the behavior of eigenvalues; the following sub-section discusses different co-dimension analyses where periodic oscillations (Hopf Bifurcation characteristic) appear in the system. These oscillations are well-known as density wave oscillations.
3.2.1.1. Co-dimension-1 bifurcation
The co-dimension-1 bifurcation analysis has been performed by varying pseudo phase-change number () as a single free parameter and other parameters are kept fixed (defined in Table 1). Herein, the Hopf bifurcation point is observed as the eigenvalue with the largest real part  transitions from negative to positive or vice-versa. The behavior of the complex conjugate eigenvalues are plotted on a complex plane in Fig. 5.
Table 1. Parametric value corresponding to Fig. 5.
Fig. 5
Fig. 5. Behavior of the eigenvalue while varying one free parameter ().
The Hopf bifurcation appears in the system when the stable and unstable periodic solutions co-exist (Strogatz, 1994). This phenomena guarantees existence of periodic solutions in non-linear dynamical systems.
3.2.1.2. Co-dimension-2 bifurcation
Subsequently, the co-dimension-2 analysis has been carried out to by varying two parameters simultaneously to obtain the stability boundary. The collection of the Hopf points is called as the Hopf bifurcation boundary, which not only bifurcates the stable and unstable regions, but also has some additional bifurcation characteristics, as shown in Fig. 2. These characteristics are discussed in this section.
3.2.1.2.1. Generalized hopf bifurcation
The first Lyapunov coefficient is the most critical parameter corresponding to the Hopf bifurcation analysis. The sign of this coefficient decides the type of Hopf bifurcations and the nature of limit cycles. In the present analysis, this coefficient changed its sign four times from positive to negative, or vice versa with variation of the pseudo-subcooling number () as shown in Fig. 6.
Fig. 6
Fig. 6. The variation in first Lyapunov Coefficient along the stability boundary (as shown in Fig. 2).
The point at which this coefficient is zero is known as the generalized Hopf (GH) bifurcation point. Hereby, Fig. 2 shows four GH bifurcation points (parametric values defined in Table 2) which are observed on bifurcation boundary in  plane. The GH bifurcation is one of the co-dimension-2 bifurcation (varying two independent system parameters), which is observed when the nature of Hopf bifurcation (subcritical to supercritical or vice-versa) is changed. It is also known as Bautin bifurcation. The GH point indicates the origin or collision of the branches of sub and supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. At parameter values near to the GH point, stable and unstable limit cycles separate. Therefore, this phenomena is peculiar in comparison to the usual growing and decaying oscillations in the system and has not been discussed in the present analysis. The present analysis is limited only to the detection of the GH points. In bifurcation theory, the dynamics of the stable and unstable limit cycle is well known as supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcation.
Table 2. Parametric values analogous to different bifurcation phenomenon observed in Fig. 2.
3.2.1.2.2. Sub- and super-critical hopf bifurcation
The first Lyapunov coefficient with positive sign corresponds to the supercritical Hopf region, whereas negative sign represents the subcritical Hopf region. The supercritical Hopf bifurcation corresponds to the stable limit cycle, which exists around an unstable fixed point (unstable focus). These stable limit cycles act as an attractor and attract all trajectories (irrespective of the size of the perturbations) of the unstable focus.
On the other hand in case of subcritical Hopf bifurcation, on the stable side the system is locally or linearly stable for small perturbation. However, for relatively large perturbation all trajectories are repelled away due to the presence of unstable limit cycle around the stable focus.
Corresponding to the aforementioned phenomena, bifurcation characteristic of the system changes five times (identifying two sub- and three super-critical Hopf regions). Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the existence of limit cycles near the bifurcation boundary at different parameter values (defined in Table 3).
Table 3. Parametric values corresponding to Figs. 7 and 8.
As shown in Fig. 7, growing oscillations are observed for the small, as well as, relatively large perturbation on the unstable side of the boundary and these oscillations settle to large constant amplitude oscillations. This indicates the existence of stable limit cycles between  and . On the other hand, before  i.e. between , and beyond  (points P1, P3 and P7 respectively) the oscillations decay for a small perturbation. However, for relatively large perturbation, growing oscillations are observed due to presence of unstable limit cycle, as shown in Fig. 8. These numerical simulations confirm the existence of sub- and super-critical Hopf bifurcation characteristics.
3.2.2. Ledinegg Instability
When the system dynamics experiences a sudden change or when the operating point moves from one unstable equilibrium to another new stable equilibrium state, it is known as static instability. Ledinegg instability (or flow excursion) is one such well-known static instability. For a better understanding, several researchers (Ambrosini, 2007; Liu et al., 2019; Pandey and Singh, 2017; Rahman and Singh, 2019; Ruspini, 2013) have explained flow excursion instability through multi-valued hydrodynamic characteristic curves (a typical curve is shown in Fig. 9). The system operating points are at the intersection of internal (pressure drop) and external (pump) characteristics curves as discussed in several notable works (Liu et al., 2019; Pandey and Singh, 2017; Rahman and Singh, 2019; Ruspini, 2013).

Ledinegg instability occurs when the following condition is satisfied,
@(12)
As derivative of the external curve in present case is zero, therefore, the negative slope of the internal characteristic curve indicates unstable operating conditions, as also specified by the eigenvalues (Fig. 4). Therefore, the system experiences sudden change and moves into another equilibrium state (which is at positive slope region).
The flow characteristic curve has been plotted (Fig. 10) between steady state pressure drop and inlet velocity at a fixed heat flux for three values of sub-cooling numbers (. From the figure it can be observed that for , the internal characteristic curve intersects the driving head (applied external pressure drop ) curve only once, hence, there is only one equilibrium. Moreover, from the slope of the internal characteristics it is inferred that this equilibrium is stable. However, for  there are three equilibriums, an unstable equilibrium point between two stable operating points. Therefore, a perturbation at the unstable equilibrium leads the system to one of the stable equilibriums. The transition of the system from one stable equilibrium to three (one unstable and two stable) equilibriums characterizes Ledinegg instability. From the figure it can be seen that the Ledinegg instability threshold is at a value of .
Fig. 10
Fig. 10. Characteristic diagram of steady state pressure vs mass flow in heated channel.
In the bifurcation theory, Ledinegg instability curve intersects with DWO curve at a point represented by the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation point (BT). In the next section, this bifurcation has been discussed in detail.
3.2.2.1. Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation
As shown in Fig. 2, two BT points ( and ) are observed, which indicate that Ledinegg instability lies between DWOs regions. This is a co-dimension-2 bifurcation, the Hopf bifurcation originates or terminates at the BT point At the BT point critical equilibrium of a set of autonomous ODEs has at least two zero eigenvalues. The corresponding parametric values of  and  are given in Table 2.
In order to capture other bifurcation phenomena, similar analysis has been carried out for Ledinegg instability (between  and .
3.2.2.1.1. Co-dimension-1 bifurcation
The equilibrium curve, while varying one free parameter ( number), has been drawn between the two BT points, as shown in Fig. 11. Two branch points (BP) are observed on both sides of the neutral saddle-node (H) point. According to bifurcation theory, branch points originate or terminate at limit point (saddle-node bifurcation) curve and is a co-dimension-2 type bifurcation. To further analyze the system near the branch point, co-dimension 2 bifurcation is carried out.
Fig. 11
Fig. 11. Equilibrium curve while varying one free parameter ().
3.2.2.1.2. Co-dimension-2 bifurcation
The co-dimension-2 bifurcation analysis has been carried out originating from the branch point. In this context, the limit point curve (Fig. 12) has been obtained by varying two free parameters (. In this curve, two saddle node branches (limit point curves); passing through BT points, surround the Ledinegg instability region. On the limit point curve (shown in Fig. 12 using green dotted line) all eigenvalues are negative except one (which is zero). It should be noted that, some part of the curve is not in the physically feasible region as  number is greater than  (represented using diamond pointer line in Fig. 12). This region is infeasible due to the fact that the whole channel is filled by a subcooled liquid (heavy fluid), which implies that the pseudo-critical boundary is not inside the channel.
Fig. 12
Fig. 12. Limit point curve around the BT points, shows Ledinegg instability characteristics.
In order to observe the above-discussed phenomena some numerical simulations around the limit point curve (denoted by star pointers in Fig. 12) have been carried out at different parametric values (defined in Table 4). The point  is at the threshold of Ledinegg instability and hence, has two stable equilibrium points. The time evolution of the system shows that for positive perturbation it comes back to the initial stable equilibrium state, whereas for negative perturbation the system moves towards a new stable equilibrium point. However, the numerical scheme collapses before it settles to the abovementioned equilibrium (denoted in Fig. 13 with solid line) as other stable equilibrium point exists at higher velocity (as shown in Fig. 10).
Table 4. Parameter values corresponding to Figs. 13 and 14.
Fig. 13
Fig. 13. Numerical simulation showing non-oscillatory behavior of the system around stable arc of limit point curve.
In the same way, the point  corresponds to the internal characteristic curve indicated by green line, therefore only one operating point exists (as shown in Fig. 10, with dotted line). Hence, for both negative and positive perturbations the system returns back to its initial equilibrium state, without experiencing any oscillation, as shown in Fig. 13 (with dotted line). Furthermore at point , indicated by red line, three (one unstable and two stable) equilibrium points exist. Therefore, the system comes back to initial equilibrium point for positive perturbation, but moves and settles into a new equilibrium point for the negative perturbation in the system (denoted in Fig. 13 with narrow dotted line). The abovementioned behavior of the system confirms the Ledinegg instability phenomena.
On the other hand, star dotted line in Fig. 12, that arc represents unstable points as two of eigenvalues are observed to be positive (no bifurcation occurred), however limit point curve is observed through numerical computational tool (MATCONT©) as one of the eigenvalue (from the remaining 11) becomes zero. Therefore, for both negative and positive perturbations, the system behavior is unstable as shown in Fig. 14.
In addition to above analysis, a special type of bifurcation point known as Cusp point is also observed at the meeting point of two branches on the limit point curve.
<Section>4. Parametric effects on bifurcation phenomena</Section>
The system characteristics are dependent on the choice of the parameter values. For this purpose, design and operational parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out with the current model. Following the trend of earlier studies (Dokhane, 2004; Karve, 1998; Rizwan-Uddin and Dorning, 1986) the effect of various design parameters on bifurcation boundary of the system is investigated in this section. In this regard, primarily inlet loss (), exit loss , and friction factor  coefficient are varied (defined in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 respectively) around their nominal values. The shifting of bifurcation characteristic in terms of stability boundaries in the  plane with parameter variation is rarely reported in the literature.

4.1. Effect of inlet and exit loss coefficient
Increasing the inlet flow resistance (inlet loss coefficient) enhances the stability of the system. As observed in Fig. 15, increasing  values, shifts the stability boundary towards the right hand side thereby making the system more stable. Simultaneously, the dynamic stability increases as the Ledinegg stability region (between  to  decreases with increasing . It is to be noted that the different bifurcation points also shift slightly (Table 5) along with the stability boundary.

Similarly, increase in the exit loss coefficient ( value reduces the outlet flow velocity which has a destabilizing impact on the system. Concurrently, the bifurcation point also shifts with the stability boundary, as shown in Fig. 16.

It should be noted from Figs. 15 and 16 that as the system becomes more stable, the static stability regime reduces, whereas the dynamic stability regime simultaneously increases for a high pseudo-phase change number.
4.2. Effect of friction factor coefficient
The frictional coefficient (is a function of diameter, length and a frictional factor of the heated channel, which indicates the frictional pressure drop in the system. An increment in the value of the coefficient represents a stabilizing impact on the system. It also observed from Fig. 17, that the dynamic and static stability regime are not affected with  values.

<Section>5. Conclusion</Section>
The present work is devoted to a detailed analysis of the DWOs and Ledinegg instability behavior of a heated channel under supercritical fluid flow (working medium) condition. Recently developed Novel Nodalized Reduced Order Model (NNROM) is used in the present analysis with the same geometry and flow condition. By carrying out the non-linear stability analysis, the dynamic (Density Wave Oscillations) and static (Ledinegg) stability boundary, interconnected through BT bifurcation point are obtained. These stability maps divide the parametric space (of pseudo phase change number () and sub-cooling number ()) into three regimes showing different physical characteristics of the system The Ledinegg instability region lies between two DWO regions. Based on the bifurcation methodology, DWO regime is indicated by Hopf bifurcation, whereas Ledinegg instability regime is identified by saddle-node bifurcation. The co-dimensional analysis has been carried out separately in both regimes. The first and third region, are further divided into subcritical and supercritical Hopf regions, respectively. The different types of Hopf bifurcation become evident through the sign of First Lyapunov coefficient.
The Ledinegg instability (second region), are explained by internal and external characteristics of the system as drawn in the pressure drop-mass flow rate plane. In Ledinegg instability regime, the hydrodynamic characteristic curves has led to identification of multiple equilibrium points. The interplay of these equilibrium points has been seen through saddle-node bifurcation. Several non-linear dynamics; represented by different types of bifurcation such as Bogdanov-Takens point (BT, intersection of Hopf and limit point curve), branch point (BP, meeting or originating point of limit point curve), Cusp point (CP, as intersection of two Branch point or Limit point curve) are observed. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been performed to demonstrate the oscillation around the equilibrium state, as well as, the system transition from one equilibrium state to another. The study also concluded that the operating parameters significantly influence the bifurcation curve along with the shifting of Bogdanov-Takens (BT) and Generalized Hopf (GH) bifurcation points.
