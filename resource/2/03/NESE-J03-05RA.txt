<Section>Abstract</Section>
Within the framework of EUROfusion consortium, the work package S2 aims at developing the HELIcal-axis Advanced Stellarator (HELIAS) as a possible long-term alternative to a tokamak DEMO. From the plasma physics standpoint, the HELIAS 5-B machine is the most promising concept. It is a large 5 field period stellarator reactor directly extrapolated from Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), the largest stellarator reactor currently run by W7-X team [1]. Researches are currently ongoing at KIT in order to attain a preliminary design of the HELIAS 5-B breeding blanket (BB), taking into account as initial input the design experience acquired in the pre-conceptual design phase of the tokamak DEMO BB. To this end, the Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) and the Water-Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) BB concepts have been considered, focusing on the investigation of the suitability of their main structural features to the stellarator geometry. In this regard, possible design constraints coming from the Remote Maintenance have to be fulfilled in order to better orient the blanket segmentation. In the present work, a more sophisticated assessment of the BB modules structural behavior has been performed. Attention has been also paid to the refinement of the numerical models so far adopted, investigating the impact of the major assumptions, such as Vacuum Vessel temperature and equivalent Young’s Modulus, on the obtained results. To this purpose, dedicated parametric assessment has been carried out and discussed in this work. The obtained results are herewith presented and critically discussed, giving an overview of the follow-up of this activity.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The European roadmap for the realization of fusion energy [2] foresees the demonstration of fusion electricity generation, through the DEMO machine exploitation, by the first half of this century. To this purpose DEMO reactor, conceived according to the tokamak concept, is currently being designed under the umbrella of EUROfusion consortium. In parallel, EUROfusion is also promoting studies on the stellarator concept, considered as the backup solution for the DEMO design. In particular feasibility studies of a HELIcal-axis Advanced Stellarator (HELIAS) [3,4], equipped with a tritium Breeding Blanket (BB), are currently ongoing.
The studies on HELIAS are in a very early stage compared to the DEMO ones. Nevertheless, preliminary research activities are ongoing at KIT [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] in order to gather basic results aimed at developing, in a next future, the design of a BB for the HELIAS 5-B machine. In this framework, the present work reports the advancements in the assessment aimed at defining the boundaries for future structural analysis. Firstly, an estimation of the BB segments [10] weight is provided in order to cope with possible Remote Maintenance (RM) restraints. Then, a parametric analysis aimed at verifying the impact of the assumed equivalent Young’s Modulus on the BB displacement field has been carried out. Lastly, starting from [5], a more sophisticated assessment of the BB deformation field has been performed, adopting a discrete 3D thermal field for the BB and different Vacuum Vessel temperatures.
The study has been carried out adopting a numerical approach based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and using the Ansys v.19.1 FEM code.
<Section>2. The HELIAS 5-B breeding blanket</Section>
A 3D geometric model of half HELIAS-5B field period, including the Vacuum Vessel (VV) and dummy BB segments (full homogenized blocks without internal details), has been considered (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1
Fig. 1. The HELIAS 5-B BB half torus sector.
It extends toroidally for 36 ° encompassing 8 BB rings which have been designed to be separated by 20 mm gaps. Each ring is composed by 5 BB segments separated, in their turn, by 20 mm gaps along poloidal direction.
The far end rings, namely Ring 1 “triangular shape” region and Ring 8 “bean shape” region, have been separately assessed in this work (Fig. 2). Each ring’s geometric model includes the proper portion of VV (divided in inner, shield and outer VV) and, within each segment, the Back Supporting Structure (BSS), the Breeding Zone (BZ), the First Wall (FW) and the 2 mm-thick tungsten armor (W) [8]. In Fig. 2 the segments within each ring have been properly numbered to easily identify them in the following.
Fig. 2
Fig. 2. Ring 1 and Ring 8 geometric models.
Eurofer steel has been considered for BB segments including a W armor facing the plasma, whereas AISI 316 steel has been assumed for the VV, including a steel-water mixture in the VV shielding layer. Temperature dependent thermomechanical properties have been adopted. As homogenized dummy segments are considered, proper equivalent densities have been calculated and adopted in order to consider properly the masses of the structural materials, breeder and coolant. To this end, the same material compositions [11] as the Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) [[12], [13], [14]] and Water-Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) [[15], [16], [17]] DEMO BBs have been assumed.
<Section>3. Estimation of the BB segments weight</Section>
The interface between BB and RM plays a crucial role in the BB development, both for DEMO and HELIAS. In particular, RM shall impose a limit on the BB segments weight in order to ensure that the existing tools are capable of safely handling BB segments. Therefore, the weight of the HELIAS 5-B BB segments belonging to Ring 1 and Ring 8 has been estimated considering HCPB and WCLL BB concepts. To this purpose, the above mentioned equivalent densities have been used The other BB concepts presently investigated in EU [18],[19] for the DEMO BB design are not considered in this study. The calculated weights are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Estimated BB segments weight [103 kg].
Results show that, for the HCPB BB, the heaviest segment is segment 3, which is 19.9∙103 kg heavy in Ring 1 whereas it reaches 30.4∙103 kg in Ring 8. Higher weights are calculated for WCLL BB concept due to the presence of liquid metal as breeder.
This preliminary evaluation represents the starting point to define the BB-RM interface following a systems engineering approach [20,21]. In this way a set of design constraints shared by the interfacing system shall be developed in order to better orient the reciprocal design.
<Section>4. Parametric study of the equivalent Young’s Modulus influence</Section>
In the preliminary HELIAS 5-B BB structural analysis reported in [5,6], temperature dependent Young’s Modulus (E) values equal to 10% of the actual ones [22] have been used for the dummy FW, BZ, BSS and VV shield (namely the intermediate layer in between inner and outer VV). This assumption aims at making displacement comparable with that of the real structure. As to VV inner and outer layers, actual ASIS 316 properties have been used as they are not dummy components
In this work, a parametric study of the assumed E value has been performed to investigate its influence on the displacement field, focusing on the variation of the residual gaps between adjacent BB segments. Temperature-dependent values of E equal to 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the actual ones have been considered and results have been compared to the reference case in which E = 10% was adopted. To this purpose, Ring 1 and Ring 8 without W armor have been considered to be consistent with the reference case [6]. Only HCPB BB concept has been considered.
4.1. The Ring 1 and Ring 8 FEM models
The same FEM model already developed for the study reported in [6] has been used. Concerning the thermal state, spatially-averaged temperatures of FW, BZ, BSS and VV have been calculated from the DEMO BB thermal analysis and imposed [[23], [24], [25]]. In particular, FW has been assumed at 445.8 °C, BZ at 588.0 °C, BSS at 328.5 °C and VV at 200 °C. Regarding gravity load, the global Z direction has been considered as the vertical one (Fig. 2). Lastly, a proper set of mechanical constraints (Fig. 3) has been applied. All the BB components have been considered as mechanically tied.
Fig. 3
Fig. 3. Mechanical restraints.
4.2. Results of the E parametric analysis
The obtained results in terms of minimum residual gap between adjacent BB segments are reported in Table 2, Table 3. Negative values (in red) mean that overlapping between neighboring segments occurs.
Table 2. E parametric analysis results - Ring 1.
Table 3. E parametric analysis results - Ring 8.
Results have shown that the higher is the considered E, the lower is the minimum residual gap. This means that the condition of E = 100 % represents the most conservative case since it causes the narrowest minimum residual gaps. Anyway, this influence is moderate almost everywhere, except for Ring 1 - Seg 3-4 gap where a reduction in minimum residual gap of ∼50 %, passing from E = 10% to E = 100%, has been predicted.
On the basis of these results, two limit scenarios can be identified for the following:
•
Less Conservative (LC) scenario: that one where E = 10% of the actual ones are assumed.
•
More Conservative (MC) scenario: that one where actual E values are assumed.
<Section>5. Structural assessment of Ring 1 and Ring 8</Section>
In order to obtain a more precise evaluation of the residual gap between adjacent segments within Ring 1 and Ring 8 of the HELIAS 5-B HCPB BB, FEM models adopted for the E sensitivity study have been refined.
5.1. The Ring 1 and Ring 8 refined FEM models
The refined Ring 1 and Ring 8 FEM models include the W armor. Moreover, in order to apply a discrete 3D temperature profile taken from DEMO HCPB BB thermal analysis, all the components of the geometric model shown in Fig. 2 have been purposely sliced (Fig. 4) by means of a dedicated geometry editing campaign.
Fig. 4
Fig. 4. Ring 1 with sliced components - detail of the FW.
Coherently with the less refined FEM models, linear tetrahedral elements with an element size of 0.05 m have been selected for the mesh (Table 4).
Table 4. Advanced FEM models - mesh features.
As to the assumed thermal field, the W armor has been assumed at 551.4 °C. Differently from what previously done, properly calculated average temperatures have been imposed to each FW, BZ and BSS slice instead of to each component. As an example, the assumed FW temperature profile is reported in Table 5. Since the FW is 25 mm thick in all the segments of Ring 1 and Ring 8, the same temperature profile has been imposed to all of them. This is not true for BZ and BSS, whose thicknesses are different from one segment to another and so slightly different temperature profiles have been carried out for them, corresponding to different geometric slicing strategies.
Table 5. FW 3D discrete temperature profile.
As to VV, its three regions (inner, shield and outer) have been assumed at different temperatures. In particular, due to recent indications coming from DEMO VV design, two different cases have been considered:
•
Hot VV case [26]: characterized by VV outer at 180 °C, VV shield at 205 °C and VV inner at 230 °C.
•
Cold VV case [27]: characterized by VV outer at 40 °C, VV shield at 65 °C and VV inner at 90 °C.
Lastly, gravity loads has been taken into account considering the Z direction as the vertical one and same boundary conditions depicted in Fig. 3 have been kept. All the components are considered as tied from the mechanical point of view.
Hence, Ring 1 and Ring 8 structural performances have been separately investigated in the following four steady state loading scenarios:
•
LC+Hot VV (E = 10%, VV between 180 and 230 °C)
•
MC+Hot VV (E = 100%, VV between 180 and 230 °C)
•
LC + Cold VV (E = 10%, VV between 40 and 90 °C)
•
MC + Cold VV (E = 100%, VV between 40 and 90 °C)
<Section>6. Results</Section>
The obtained results in terms of minimum residual gaps are reported, as to Ring 1, in Table 6, Table 7. Negative values (in red) mean that overlapping occurs, whereas those values lower than 5 mm (assumed as the lowest desirable minimum residual gap to cope with tolerances) are reported in blue. Results clearly show that, in both LC and MC scenarios, the cold VV acts like a rigid wall towards BB and overlapping occurs in all the assessed gaps. In fact, due its low temperature, the cold VV does not accommodate the BB segments thermal expansion. Thus, BB can only move towards the plasma chamber and this effect results in a significant reduction of the gaps between adjacent rings, finally causing overlapping. On the contrary, Hot VV cases are safe. Looking at the third column of the tables, the huge percentage variation of the minimum residual gaps due to the change in VV temperature is reported.
Table 6. Ring 1 results - LC scenarios (E = 10%).
Table 7. Ring 1 results - MC scenarios (E = 100%).
In Table 8, the influence of the E value in case of Hot VV is summarized. As expected, the lowest gaps are obtained for the MC+Hot VV scenario. The maximum percentage variation (∼65%) is predicted for segment 3-4.
Table 8. Ring 1 results - Hot VV cases.
Similar behavior has been predicted for Ring 8, as shown in Table 9, Table 10. Here, also for Hot VV condition overlapping occurs between segment 2-3 in case of MC scenario. In Table 11, the influence of E value in case of Hot VV condition is reported. As it can be observed, except for the segment 2-3 gap where overlapping is predicted, the maximum residual gap percentage variation is of 47 % (segment 1-2).
Table 9. Ring 8 results - LC scenarios (E = 10%).
Table 10. Ring 8 results - MC scenarios (E = 100%).
Table 11. Ring 8 results - Hot VV cases.
It has to be noticed that some minimum residual gaps lower than 5 mm are calculated in the Hot VV cases. This suggests to further developing the BB segments design to attain better performances. In particular, these results allow concluding that the VV temperature could represent a major constraint for the development of the HELIAS 5-B BB design. An attachment system is necessary to decouple the VV and BB, reducing the influence of VV deformation on the BB structural performances.
In the end, the total displacement field obtained in MC+Hot VV scenario for Ring 1 and Ring 8 are depicted in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, where details of the most critical gaps are also shown superimposing the undeformed wireframe to the deformed structure.

<Section>7. Future considerations</Section>
The obtained results lead to the conclusion that the next phases of the HELIAS 5-B BB design need some improvements. In particular, large BB models should be developed in order to consider more realistic boundary conditions and, moreover, a proper BB-VV attachment system should be designed to reduce the influence of the VV thermal expansion on the BB deformation. In particular, the attachments will also allow reducing the stress amount within BB induced by the VV constraint.
As to the first aspect, a 3D CAD model of a whole HELIAS 5-B BB sector, extending for 72 ° along toroidal direction, has been developed (Fig. 7). It includes 16 BB rings toroidally separated by 20 mm-gaps. Each ring still encompasses 5 BB segments poloidally segmented by gaps of 20 mm. The current gap amount will be kept in order to avoid the insurgence of excessive radiation streaming on the VV, potentially causing not acceptable radiation damage to the VV and excessive dose to the magnets. Proper structural assessments are ongoing in order to investigate the structural performances of Ring 1 and Ring 8 within this completely characterized geometric configuration.

Concerning the second point, an ITER-like attachment system [28] has been designed for Ring 1 considering M130-type radial pins. A parametric study will be launched to optimize the attachments geometric configuration and assess the BB structural behavior (Fig. 8).

Lastly, the design of the BB internal components (i.e. stiffening plates [29] and FW channels [30]) will be undertaken to attain a fully HELIAS-relevant thermal and mechanical BB characterization. This is the priority activity, as it will allow better assessing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the HELIAS BB. In this way, more precise indication for the attachments development and the potential modification of the adopted segmentation strategy will be gathered.
<Section>8. Conclusion</Section>
Within the framework of the EUROfusion consortium, a research activity is ongoing at KIT to assess the feasibility of the HELIAS 5-B stellarator fusion reactor BB. Structural calculations of the most representative BB rings have been performed adopting detailed homogenized FEM models. The quite promising outcomes encourage the follow-up of the activity aimed at assessing a whole BB sector, which extends for 72 ° toroidally. Moreover, since a strong influence of the VV temperature on the BB structural performances has been found out, the development of an attachment system devoted to connect BB and VV is crucial, together with the design of the BB segments internal components, to more realistically assess the HELIAS 5-B BB thermomechanical behavior. Lastly, the RM-BB interface should be defined adopting a systems engineering approach in order to consider proper design requirements.
