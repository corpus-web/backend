<Section>Highlights</Section>
A modified analytical model is proposed to analyze In-Vessel Melt Retention (IVR) strategy for VVER-1000 considering the effect of torospherical lower head vessel.
The analytical model shows an increase of heat load from oxidic pool to its cylindrical boundary. The increase heat load reduces concern about the focusing effect caused by metallic layer.
The maximum heat peaks imposed to VVER-1000 lower head wall predicted by the model are well below the Critical Heat Flux.
<Section>Abstract</Section>
n this paper, a Modified analytical In-Vessel melt Retention (MIVR) model is proposed to predict heat load on the VVER lower head vessel imposed by a steady state two-layer molten pool, with taking effect of the torospherical shape into consideration. The comparative calculation for the MIVR model was performed through a calculation of heat load from a quasi-steady state two-layer molten pool to the VVER-440 lower head wall. Then the MIVR model was adopted to analyze the IVR strategy for VVER-1000 reactor through a calculation of heat loads caused by four configurations of molten pools which were predicted by severe accident codes namely MELCOR v2.2, SOCRAT/B1, ASTEC v2.1 and ASTEC v2.0r3, respectively. The results clearly showed the effect of the torospherical shape of lower head on energy partition of oxidic pool with an increase of heat load from the oxidic pool to its vertical boundary. A parametric study on emissivity coefficients applied to the top of melt pool indicated that even without emissivity from the top (i.e. no radiation heat flow upwards), the peak heat flux from the vessel wall was still significantly below the maximum value of the Critical Heat Flux (CHF).

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Stabilization and retention of molten debris in reactor lower plenum followed a core melt accident through external reactor vessel cooling has been known as a novel severe accident management strategy, named as In-Vessel melt Retention (IVR) strategy. The initial feasibility of IVR was demonstrated by Theofanous, (1988) and the first concept of IVR strategy was firstly proposed for Loviisa nuclear power plant by Theofanous, (1989). Afterward, the IVR strategy was selected as severe accident management approach of two kinds of reactor designs, namely VVER-440 at Loviisa plant (Tuomisto and Theofanous, 1994, Kymäläinen et al., 1997) and AP600 (Theofanous et al., 1996). It was followed by feasibility studies for higher power reactors such as AP1000 (Esmaili and Khatib-Rahbarm, 2004), APR1400 (Rempe et al., 2005) and VVER-1000 (Sangiorgi et al., 2016).
The transient conditions/transient phases are recognized to be even more dangerous and more critical for the reactor vessel integrity than the thermal steady states, especially for high power reactor. Unfortunately, a deterministic description of corium progression in the vessel is presently not accessible as stated in Seghgal (2012). An approach of “bounding situations” has been developed to solve the problem in evaluating heat load associated with different potential corium configurations in the lower head (Theofanous et al., 1996). The thermal steady state condition is supposed to be the final bounding state of evolution of debris bed in the lower plenum, at which, the lower head vessel will suffer the largest total heat load from the molten pool and the major threat to the integrity of lower head wall is caused by an effect originated from the stratification of molten pool, called focusing effect. Up to now, a number of experimental and numerical investigations have focused on understanding molten pool convection in the final bounding states for hemispherical bottom head (Theofanous, et al., 1996, Theofanous et al., 1997; Tran and Dinh, 2009a, Tran and Dinh, 2009b, Tran and Dinh, 2009c, Tran et al., 2010), and torospherical head (Kymäläinen et al., 1994, Dombrovskii et al., 1998). It is worth noting that all numerical investigations required initial key parameters such as melt relocation masses and decay heat power density deposited in debris bed which were usually predicted by severe accident analysis codes. Although, a number of extensive series of severe accident calculations were required to identify final bounding states, Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCAs), Station BlackOuts (SBOs), and Loss of Feed Water (LOFW) scenarios and those combinations were assumed to be major IVR scenarios.
More recently, the primary studies on the feasibility of the IVR strategy for VVER-1000 reactor have been analyzed under Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LBLOCA) along with total SBO by using different severe accident codes, namely ASTEC v2.0r3 (Gencheva et al., 2016), MELCOR v1.8.6 (Duspiva, 2015), and MELCOR v2.2/ SOCRAT-B1/ ASTEC v2.1 codes through benchmark calculation (Duspiva et al., 2019). The calculation results have confirmed that the IVR strategy could prevent VVER-1000 lower head vessel from failure in some cases. However, the large discrepancies were found in the predicted mass components of debris bed and heat flux distribution on the external surface of lower head wall in different codes. In addition, there are still some limitations of severe accident codes in terms of the heat transfer between lower head vessel and a molten pool, especially are natural convection heat transfer characteristics in volumetrically-heated molten pools.
The bottom head of VVER reactors, including VVER-1000, are commonly called the elliptical lower head, but more precisely is the torospherical lower head which comprises a semi-elliptic part (hereafter called as elliptical part) and a straight flange height. Due to the nearly flat lower head vessel of VVER reactors, the molten pool establishing during the core melt accident can spill over into the cylindrical part of lower head vessel. The results obtained from Gencheva et al. (2016) even indicated the volume of the oxidic pool spilt over into the cylindrical part of VVER-1000 lower head vessel. The feature is supposed to be a major difference in the analysis of heat distribution of oxidic pool located in a torospherical lower head and a hemispherical lower head in which oxidic pool is completely bounded by curvature. Seghgal (2012) also pointed out that the structure and the convective behaviors of the molten pool in the torospherical bottom head and in the hemispherical bottom head seem to be similar, whereas the differences are only expected in the heat transfer profiles. Additionally, Zdrarek (2013) proposed technical specifications for future works to investigate the effect of elliptical shape of the lower Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) head with optimized profile of the deflector shape.
In fact, the effect of torospherical shape on heat flux partition of oxidic pool was studied in the COPO experiments (Kymäläinen et al., 1994) which was performed to evaluate heat flux distribution on boundaries of a volumetrically heated pool at high Rayleigh numbers. The results of COPO experiments pointed out there was a different trend of heat flux distribution on elliptical and vertical boundary: the heat flux distribution on the vertical boundary (side wall) was essentially uniform, whereas the heat flux on elliptical boundary (curved wall) varied and strongly depended on position along the curved wall. In addition, Kymäläinen et al., 1994 concluded that the heat flux along the lower curved wall seems to be independent of the presence and extent of the liquid pool (contained by the vertical sidewalls) portion above it, for the shape consideration. That means the convectively heat transfer toward the elliptical part could be addressed independently with the convection to the cylindrical part. Dombrovskii et al. (1998) developed a combined model to determine heat load caused by a quasi-steady state two-layer molten pool to torospherical lower head vessel. However, Dombrovskii et al. (1998) together with Gencheva et al., 2016, Duspiva, 2015, Duspiva et al., 2019 did not consider the effect of torospherical shape of VVER lower head on heat flux distribution of oxidic pool. Meanwhile, the precise prediction on heat load imposing to lower head vessel from molten pool has been play a crucial role on the IVR strategy.
The present study therefore aims at proposing a modified analytical IVR model (MIVR) with bounding state approach considering the effect of torospherical shape of VVER-1000 lower head vessel on the heat flux distribution of molten pool. The first part presents the development of the MIVR model and its predictive capabilities through a comparative calculation for a quasi-steady state two-layer molten pool established in VVER-440 lower head. In the second part, the MIVR model was applied to analyze IVR strategy for VVER-1000 through four configurations of molten pool obtained by severe accident codes as MELCOR v2.2, SOCRAT/B1, ASTEC v2.1 (Duspiva et al., 2019) and ASTEC v2.0r3 (Gencheva et al., 2016), and a parametric study on the emissivity coefficients was also included.
<Section>2. MIVR model and comparative calculations</Section>
2.1. The basis of methodology
The COPO experiments (Kymäläinen et al., 1994) were performed as a part of severe accident management strategy to suspend the progression of severe accident in Loviisa nuclear power plant. The COPO experimental facility is a two-dimensional slice, Joule-heated and geometrically similar in shape (torospherical shape) to the lower head of a VVER-440 reactor, at the 1/2 scale including a portion of cylindrical vessel wall. The aim of COPO experiments was to evaluate heat flux distribution at the boundaries of volumetrically heated uniform pools at high Rayleigh numbers. The results of COPO tests presented there was a difference in heat flux profile imposed on the boundaries: an essential uniform heat flux distribution was observed on vertical boundary, whereas a heat flux distribution varied and strongly depended on positions along the curved wall. In order to demonstrate the difference, the half of results on heat flux distribution on both boundaries obtained from three tests of COPO experiments as Run 29a, 30a and 32a for the 80-cm deep pool are represented in Fig. 1. The left side of Fig. 1 shows a half of COPO experimental facility and the right one is a diagram which demonstrates the heat flux distribution on elliptical and vertical boundary in term of the ratio values between the local Nusselt number and average Nusselt number. In this diagram, the X-axis represents the ratio between the local Nusselt number and average Nusselt number, and the Y-axis represents the cooling unit arranged following the axial height of the facility.
Fig. 1. The results of heat flux distribution on elliptic and vertical boundary obtained from three tests as Run 29a, 30a and 32a of COPO experiment (Kymäläinen et al., 1994).
The diagram in Fig. 1 shows a different trend of heat flux distribution on the boundaries of the oxidic pool. This leads to appearance of a discontinuity of heat flux profile on boundaries of oxidic pool because there is a transition from curved wall of elliptical part to vertical wall of cylindrical part. Consequently, in order to precisely predict heat load caused by oxidic pool which partly spill over into cylindrical part of lower head vessel of VVER reactor, one has to use appropriate calculation method or code which have a capability of predicting the effect of transition of internal boundary.
The one-dimensional mathematical In-Vessel melt Retention model proposed by Theofanous et al., (1996) is a flexibility model to treat with different boundaries of molten pool, and the model has been adopted to successfully assess thermal response of a hemispherical lower head vessel like AP-600 (Fig. 2). Afterward, Esmaili et al., (1996) modified the one-dimensional model and developed a two-dimensional mathematical based on the one-dimensional to assess thermal response of AP-600 lower head vessel as well, and the comparison between two models not only pointed out the performance of the one-dimensional model was adequate, but also confirmed confident level of the one-dimensional model.
Fig. 2. The schematic of a two-layer stratified molten pool located in a hemispherical lower head.
As aforementioned, in case of torospherical lower head vessel like VVER reactor, the oxidic pool spilt over into the cylindrical part of lower head vessel, thus the boundary of the oxidic pool consists of curvature of elliptical part and vertical cylindrical part (Fig. 3), instead of completely bounded by curvature in hemispherical shape (Fig. 2). The transition of internal boundary of oxidic pool would lead to the discontinuity of heat flux distribution on the lower head vessel as seen in results of COPO experiments. Therefore, in order to apply the one-dimensional In-Vessel melt Retention for torospherical lower head shape, it is needed to modify it with the aim of capturing the effect. In this study, the MIVR model was developed from the original one-dimensional model proposed by Theofanous et al., (1996) with the aim of handling the difference in the boundary orientation of oxidic pool.

2.2. Development of MIVR model
In the MIVR model, one more source/sink term was added into energy conservation equation of oxidic pool which is representative of the heat flow towards vertical boundary, named as sideward heat flow. The energy conservation of oxidic pool therefore consists of three terms instead of two as in the original model. It is also assumed that there is a thin corium crust bounding the oxidic pool, and the backward radiation heat flux from other components to the top of metallic layer is ignored in the MIVR model. The schematic of a two-layer stratified molten pool located in a torospherical lower head and the nomenclatures used in MIVR model are demonstrated in Fig. 3.

For oxidic pool
The maximum temperature (Tmax) is obtained from an energy balance in which the decay heat power is dissipated by three heat flows such as upward, downward and sideward heat flow, can be written as:
(1)@
where the heat flows in upward, downward and sideward are defined as below:
(2)@
(3)@
(4)@
The heat transfers in oxidic pool are natural convections which are characterized by Nusselt numbers. The heat flows can be alternatively determined through ratio of Nusselt numbers as follows:
(5)@
(6)@
The heat flow components and maximum temperature of the oxidic pool are determined by solving Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) iteratively and then @ will be used (further below) as an input to the treatment of the metallic layer, while @ and @ are now used to obtain the crust thickness and the remaining thickness of lower head wall at the elliptical part (@ and @) and cylindrical part (@ and @), respectively.
The downward component of heat flow toward elliptical part of lower head vessel is expressed as a function of azimuthal angle based on mini-ACOPO experiment (Theofanous et al., 1996) as below:
(7)@
Under thermal equilibrium state of the oxidic pool, the heat load on the inner surface of elliptical part at each azimuthal angle, which consists of downward heat flow and decay heat generated in the corium crust, is corresponding to the conducted heat through the crust. Hence, the heat load on inner surface of elliptical part is described as follows:
(8)@
In addition, the heat toward inner surface of elliptical part, which equals the conducted heat through lower head wall, can be given as:
(9)@
Similarly, the sideward flow is conjugated to the thickness of sideward crust and the thickness of lower head wall, thus the sideward flow towards the inner surface of cylindrical part are expressed by following equations:
(10)@
(11)@
By iteratively solving the Eqs. (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), a group of three values consisting of heat flux following azimuthal angle on the internal and external surface of lower head wall, the thickness of corium crust between the oxidic pool and the lower head wall, the remaining thickness of lower head wall, at elliptical and cylindrical part of lower head vessel, would be obtained.
•
For metallic layer
The heat flux on bottom of the metallic layer is contributed by the upward heat flow from the oxidic pool and the decay heat generated in the crust between the oxidic pool and the metallic layer. As assumed the thermal equilibrium state, the heat flux through the crust is equal to the heat flux on bottom of the metallic layer, and the thickness of the crust is conjugated to the heat flow through it. Since the top crust is very thin, its sideward heat loss is ignored. Therefore, the heat flux on bottom of the metallic layer is expressed as:
(12)@
The heat flux on bottom of the metallic layer is transferred into the metallic layer by convection equation given as:
(13)@
The heat transferred to the metallic layer is dissipated by two heat sink components that are radiation on the top and convection on sideward. Hence, the energy conservation equation of the metallic layer with a heat source inside is described as:
(14)@
The upward heat flow is dissipated by radiation as below:
(15)@
Because of the thermal equilibrium state, the thickness of cylindrical vessel is consistent to the conducted heat flow through it, therefore the sideward heat flow given as:
(16)@
Eqs. (12), (13) will be solved iteratively to obtain the heat flux on the bottom of the metallic layer (@), crust thickness between the oxidic pool and the metallic layer (@), and temperature of bottom surface of the metallic layer (@). Then, these values are adapted to the Eqs. (14), (15), (16) that will be solved iteratively to get heat partitions in the metallic layer.
2.3. A comparative calculation for MIVR model
2.3.1. Heat transfer correlations in MIVR
Up to now, there have been no experiments to study thermal behavior of a molten pool bounded by torospherical shape which is the same as the VVER-1000 lower head vessel. The results obtained from the COPO experiments (Kymäläinen et al., 1994) with a two-dimensional slice Joule-heated in geometrical shape (torispherical at 1/2 scale), which is similar to the VVER-440 lower head vessel, showed that the correlations of Mayinger, et al., 1975, Steinberner and Reineke, 1978 could adequately describe heat distribution in volumetrically-heated oxidic pool. To describe the heat distribution in the metallic layer, Theofanous et al. (1996) pointed out that the correlations of Globe and Dropkin, 1959, Churchill and Chu, 1975 were adequate. Therefore, the correlations which describe heat transfer behavior of molten pool located in torospherical lower head will be selected in the MIVR model.
Aiming at investigating the effect of torospherical lower head vessel to the heat distribution of the molten pool captured in the MIVR model, in this comparative calculation, the MIVR model is separated into two models with identifiers as follows: MIVR1 with adding sideward heat flow component and MIVR2 without adding sideward heat flow component. The heat transfer correlations for the MIVR models are detailed in Table 1.

For heat transfer from lower head wall to external cooling water, it is assumed that the heat transfer regime is nucleate boiling which used heat transfer coefficient from Rohsenow’s correlations (Rohsenow, 1952).
2.3.2. Initial parameters of comparative calculation
The remarkable of the MIVR model is shown out through a comparative calculation on heat flow rates to VVER-440 lower head vessel from a quasi-steady state two-layer stratified molten pool. The initial parameters were referred from Dombrovskii et al., (2006) and given in Table 2.
Table 2. The initial parameters of the comparative calculation.
Parameters	Values
The height of elliptical part of oxidic pool (m)	0.96
The height of cylindrical part of oxidic pool (m)	0.09
The height of metallic layer (m)	0.45
The initial thickness of lower head wall (m)	0.14
The liquidus temperature of oxidic pool (K)	2700
The liquidus temperature of oxidic pool (K)	1800
The volumetrically decay heat generated in oxidic pool (MW/m3)	1.5

The predictions of the MIVR models will be compared to the results of Dombrovskii et al., (2006) obtained from Case 1 and Case 3 which used an effective heat conductivity model and a combined model between the heat balance model and the effective heat conductivity, respectively. The radiation coefficient of the metallic layer in both MIVR models was a value of 0.3 which corresponds to the emissivity of the metallic layer in Case 1 and Case 3 without supplying water to cooling from top of metallic layer. The correlations used in calculations of Dombrovskii et al., (2006) are listed in Table 1.

2.3.3. Results of the comparative calculation
a)
Analysis on results of two MIVR models
The predictions of MIVR1 and MIVR2 on heat loads imposed to internal surface of VVER-440 lower head wall are demonstrated in Fig. 4. Generally, it clearly showed that the trend of heat load on internal surface of VVER-440 lower head wall predicted by both MIVR models were in good agreement with the trends of heat flux distribution along the cooling curved boundary, which was observed in both COPO experiments (Kymäläinen et al., 1994) and mini-ACOPO experiments. The lowest location suffered the lowest heat load from molten pool and the head load increased along the curvature of the lower head wall. The intensive heat load (or known as focusing effect) was observed in both MIVR models induced by metallic layers, which was also seen in calculations for AP600 (Theofanous et al., 1996).
Fig. 4. Heat loads on internal surface of VVER-440 lower head predicted by MIVR models.
Fig. 4 shows the predictions that were quite identical for two models on heat loads caused by oxidic pool to the elliptical part of lower head wall in the range between 0 and 0.94 m of its height. However, there was a slightly difference at around the heights between 0.2 and 0.4 m due to difference in the height which was basis to define the azimuthal angles of downward heat flow. In MIVR1 model, the height was only the height of elliptical part of oxidic pool because the cylindrical part was splitted and treated differently. Meanwhile, in MIVR2, the height was taken as the total height of oxidic pool.
It can be seen from the results of COPO experiments (Kymäläinen et al., 1994) that there was a different trend of heat flux distribution between elliptical boundary and vertical cylindrical boundary even the conditions for both boundaries were identical. Also, the COPO experiments results indicated that Steinberner and Reineke (1978)’s correlation predicted well the heat flux on the vertical boundary. The MIVR model in this study treated boundary conditions of the elliptical and cylindrical parts differently in heat transfer correlations, and we also observed the different trends of heat flux on elliptical and vertical boundary which are in good agreement with the results of COPO experiments. In MIVR1 model, the vertical cylindrical part of oxidic pool was treated in different manner from elliptical part with the Steinberner and Reineke, (1978) correlation which was proved to predict well for vertical boundary (Kymäläinen et al., 1994). Meanwhile, the cylindrical boundary was included and treated as the elliptical boundary by using the Mayinger, et al. (1975)’s correlation for a curved boundary in MIVR2 model. With the differences in methodology on defining heat partition of oxidic pool, there was a remarkable difference between predictions of both MIVR models on heat loads imposed to cylindrical part of oxidic pool. The results of MIVR1 model showed a different trend of heat load on cylindrical part compared to elliptical part, and it presented an step increase of heat load in cylindrical part which was not seen from prediction of MIVR2 model.
It is worth noting that the metallic layer results from the steel present in the PWR and the BWR lower heads that is melted by the corium pool, and since it is lighter it rises to the top of the corium pool (Seghgal, 2012). The metallic layer receives heat from the corium pool and performs Rayleigh-Benard convection transferring heat transversely to the vessel wall. In the absence of water inside the vessel, the metallic layer cannot be efficiently cooled on the top and will transmit most of the power coming from the oxidic pool and from its own deposition to the vessel wall, which is then subject to a highly elevated heat flux (focusing effect). The step increase of heat load at transition from oxidic pool to metallic layer was observed in both MIVR models, and both results showed an intensive heat loads caused by metallic layers to VVER-440 lower head wall.
However, the heat peak predicted by MIVR1 model was lower than prediction of MIVR2 model. This can be explained that the MIVR1 model predicted a higher head load imposed to internal surface of VVER-440 lower head wall by oxidic pool than prediction of MIVR2 model, which means the lower total heat flow transferred up to metallic layer in MIVR1 model compared to MIVR2 model. The comparison between predictions of MIVR1 and MIVR2 models indicated that the MIVR1 model with treating the vertical boundary of oxidic pool presented a better prediction of heat flux distributed on the internal surface of a torospherical lower head wall compared to MIVR2 model.
To demonstrate the remarkable prediction of the MIVR1 model similar to the result of COPO experiment, the expression of heat flux distribution on elliptical and vertical boundary of VVER-440 lower head wall imposed by oxidic pool are replaced by the ratio of the local Nusselt number and the average Nusselt number and are presented in Fig. 5. This figure shows the heat flux profile predicted by MIVR1 model has similar trend to result of COPO experiment. The heat flux distribution on elliptical part varied along the curved elliptical boundary and there is a discontinuity of heat flux when the boundary departs from elliptical part to cylindrical part. Therefore, the MIVR1 model is capability of capturing the effect of torospherical lower head shape on heat partition of oxidic pool.
a)
Comparisons between MIVR predicted results and references
Fig. 5. Demonstration on heat load imposed to VVER-440 lower head wall by oxidic pool through the ratio of the local Nusselt number and the average Nusselt number.
The heat loads imposed to the internal surface of VVER-440 lower head wall predicted by MIVR1 model and Dombrovskii et al. (2006) are both presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the heat load from elliptical part of oxidic pool to VVER-440 lower head wall predicted by MIVR1 model are in good agreement with the predictions in Case 1 and Case 3 at heights from 0.4 to 0.9 m. However, the difference arises from zero to the height of 0.4 m in the bottom of oxidic pool due to difference in initial condition of the lowest location at which the authors assumed that the heat load was zero. For the cylindrical part of oxidic pool, the effect of the cylindrical boundary was only captured in MIVR1 calculation. There was an increase in heat load imposed to the vertical cylindrical part of lower head wall, which was not captured in both cases of Dombrovskii et al. (2006).
Fig. 6. Heat loads on internal surface of VVER-440 lower head predicted by MIVR1 model and Reference.
The MIVR1 calculations on an intensive head load caused by metallic layer to the lower head wall were in good agreement with the predictions of Dombrovskii et al. (2006). However, the heat peak predicted by MIVR1 model is 886 kW/m2 which is much lower than the value of 1500 kW/m2 predicted in both Case1 and Case 3. The difference can be explained as follows:
•
There was an overestimation of bulk temperature of the oxidic pool in Dombrovskii et al., (2006) due to the assumption that there was zero heat flow at the lowest point of the oxidic pool. This would induce a larger heat flow rate transferred to upper metallic layer compared to that of MIVR1 model;
•
There was a difference in using heat transfer model for metallic layer. In calculation of Dombrovskii et al., (2006) concerned about the multi-layer of temperature in metallic layer, whereas in MIVR1 model, the isothermal was applied for metallic layer. Therefore, their prediction of the heat flux density on the top surface would radially decrease, whereas prediction of MIVR1 model was constant in radial direction (Fig. 7). As a result, the total heat loss from radiation predicted by the MIVR1 model is higher than that of Dombrovskii et al., (2006), accordingly it would lead to a lower prediction of heat load from metallic layer to VVER-440 vessel wall in both MIVR models;
Fig. 7. Radiation heat flux density on the top surface of metallic layer.
•
In addition, the increase heat load on the cylindrical part also reduced the heat flow transferred to metallic layer for MIVR1 model. Therefore, the boundary of metallic layer would suffer less heat load. This also contributed to the prediction of heat peak caused by metallic layer in MIVR1 model lower compared to predictions of Case 1 and Case 3.
The results of heat load from the molten pool to VVER-440 lower head wall predicted by MIVR1 model are in quite good agreement with the predictions of Dombrovskii et al., (2006), especially the heat flow rates from oxidic pool. Moreover, the MIVR1 model is able to capture the effect of cylindrical boundary on the energy partition in oxidic pool that was not captured in the calculations of Dombrovskii et al., (2006). Although there are still few differences in the results between MIVR1 model and the reference, the calculation results have shown clearly the applicability and confident level of MIVR models to predict the thermal distribution of two-layered molten locating in torospherical lower head vessel like VVER reactors. Also, the calculation results of two MIVR models have emphasized that the increasing heat load from the oxidic pool to the cylindrical boundary observed in MIVR1 calculation would help reduce heat load from metallic layer to lower head compared to MIVR2 calculation. This probably reduces the concern about focusing effect caused by the metallic layer.

3.1. Initial and boundary conditions
In section 2, the comparative calculation of heat load to the VVER-440 lower head vessel demonstrated the predictive capability of MIVR models. In this section, the MIVR models will be applied to predict heat loads from configurations of two layered molten pool to the VVER-1000 lower head vessel. The VVER-1000 reactor has a torospherical lower head which is similar to VVER-440 reactor, except a larger diameter of cylinder. Therefore, it is convenient to extend the MIVR model for IVR analysis of VVER-1000 reactor. The heat transfer correlations for MIVR calculations remain the same as presented in section 2 (Table 1).
The initial and boundary conditions are mainly based on results of the previous studies on IVR strategy for VVER-1000 (Duspiva, 2015, Gencheva et al., 2016, Duspiva et al., 2019) using different severe accident codes. These studies presented different results on configurations of debris bed in VVER-1000 lower plenum under conservative scenarios of LBLOCA plus SBO accident. Mass components of debris bed predicted by these studies are given in Table 3. To aim at better viewing of individual component predicted by different codes, mass components are demonstrated in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the calculations by MELCOR v2.2 (Duspiva et al., 2019), MELCOR V1.8.6 (Duspiva, 2015) and ASTEC v2.0 r3 (Gencheva et al., 2016) predicted whole core fuels relocating to VVER-1000 lower plenum. Meanwhile, the ASTEC v2.1 and SOCRAT/B1 (Duspiva et al., 2019) predicted a part of metallic uranium was mixed in metallic layer and it is expected to produce amount of heat in the metallic layer up to 20% of total decay heat generated in VVER-1000 lower plenum.
Table 3. Mass of components predicted by different codes relocating to VVER-1000 lower plenum.
All calculations showed that in case of LBLOCA plus SBO accident, the structural oxidation was low due to steam starved ambient. Total produced mass of ZrO2 and steel oxides were low (Fig. 8). The total mass of steel relocated to the VVER-1000 lower plenum was predicted in wide range. The prediction of SOCRAT/B1 is the largest with 83.5 tons, followed by ASTEC v2.1 and ASTEC v2.0 r3, respectively are 72.2 and 69.84 tons. Meanwhile, the MELCOR v2.2 and MELCOR v1.8.6 predicted smaller amounts of mass of steel which were 31.4 and 45.5 tons, respectively. The results of the MELCOR codes on mass of steel raised the concern about focusing effect caused by a thin metallic layer onto the VVER-1000 lower head vessel wall.
Fig. 8. Comparison mass of individual components in VVER-1000 lower plenum predicted by different codes.
In the present calculation, the configurations of molten pool predicted by MELCOR v2.2, SOCRAT/B1, ASTEC v2.1 in Duspiva et al., (2019) and ASTEC v2.0 r3 in Gencheva et al. (2016) are selected to analyze, with the identifiers as MP1, MP2, MP3 and MP4, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, the analysis is focused on the steady-state two-layer stratified molten pool in which the components as UO2, ZrO2 and steel oxides are grouped into oxidic pool, and the metallic components are grouped into metallic layer. The characteristics of oxidic pool and metallic layer are adopted from Loktionov et al. (2018) and given in Table 4.
Table 4. Thermal-physical properties of the molten pool.
It is worth noting that the time duration for establishing a steady-state two-layer molten pool in VVER-1000 lower plenum varied from 4 to 6 h since the accident was initiated. Therefore, it is conservatively assumed that a quasi-steady state two-layer molten pool established in the VVER-1000 lower plenum at 4 h since the initiation of the LBLOCA plus SBO accident. The decay heat powers after subtracting 20% power of volatile products predicted by MELCOR v2.2, SOCRAT/B1, ASTEC v2.1 (Duspiva et al., 2019) are displayed on Fig. 9. The decay heat power predicted by ASTEC v2.0 r3 (Gencheva et al., 2016) is given in Table 5. Consequently, the decay heat powers generated in MP1, MP2, MP3 and MP4 in this calculation are 17.5, 17.7, 20 and 23.4 MW, respectively. The selected emissivity coefficient of the metallic layer is 0.45. The mass of metallic uranium mixed in metallic layers of MP2 and MP3 were 13.9 and 11.3 tons, respectively. According Duspiva et al. (2019), the decay heat power deposited in metal layer of MP2 was estimated to occupy 20% of total decay heat power generated by all core fuels. Since the total input mass of UO2 in Duspiva et al. (2019) were taken as 85.9 tons in all calculations, and the difference between the ratios of 13.6/85.9 (0.158) and 11.3/85.9 (0.132) is insignificant. Therefore, we assumed the decay heat power generated in metallic layer of MP3 also occupied 20% of the total decay heat power.

Table 5. Decay heat power history of ASTEC v2.0 r3.
The detail information of the configurations of molten pool in four cases and the volumetric heat fluxes are given in Table 6.
Table 6. Configurations of molten pools.
The approach to quantify decay heat power deposited in oxidic pool and metallic layer of MP2 and MP3 was specifically described as follows:
-
In MP2 configuration, the mass of UO2 and metallic Uranium was 73.3 and 11.6 tons, respectively. Since the atomic mass of Oxygen is much smaller than Uranium, the total mass of Uranium in MP2 configuration was simply estimated 84.9 tons (approximately equal to 85.9 tons) that means all core fuels relocated to lower plenum. Therefore, we assumed the decay heat generated in oxidic pool of MP2 occupied the remaining 80% of total decay power. The total decay power generated by MP2 was 17.7 MW by subtracting 20% power of volatile products. Consequently, the decay heat generated by metallic layer and oxidic pool were 3.54 MW and 14.16 MW, respectively. The volumes of metallic layer and oxidic pool were 16.4 and 13.0 m3, and the corresponding decay heat power densities were 0.22 and 1.09.
-
In MP3 configuration, the mass of UO2 was 59.8 tons. It was recognized that there was a certain amount of UO2 stuck in reactor core. In order to quantify the decay heat power for oxidic pool, the ratio of mass UO2 in oxidic pool per total (59.8/85.9 = 0.696) was taken as the ratio between power decay heat generated in oxidic pool and total decay heat generated by all core fuels. The total decay heat generated by core fuel by subtracting 20% power of volatile products was 20 MW. Therefore, the decay heat power generated in metallic layer and oxidic pool were calculated as 4 and 13.9 MW, respectively. The volumes of metallic layer and oxidic pool were 13.7 and 10.0 m3, and the corresponding decay heat power density were 0.29 and 1.39.

The Critical Heat Flux correlations
The SULTAN full-scale experimental facility (Rouge, 1997) has been known as the flexible experimental facility, because the facility could perform a wide range of parameters which affects to CHF value. Especially, the CHF measures from SULTAN experiment were made on a large heated plate which was held at different inclination angles to the horizontal. In addition, the data obtained from SULTAN experiments were done with different mass flow velocities of cooling water available at different pressures. With the advance and flexible features, these data from SULTAN experiments were pertinent to the external vessel cooling of various lower head vessel like semi-elliptic shaped lower head vessel of VVER-1000. Afterward, the CHF correlation was developed for CATHARE code based on SULTAN experiments (Rouge, et al., 1999), and this CHF correlation was used for IVR evaluation of VVER-1000 in Sangiorgi et al. (2016). Therefore, the CHF correlation developed for CATHARE code will be used in this study. The CHF profile can be expressed as a function of axial height of molten pool in follows:
(17)CHF = −0.643h2 + 0.9479h + 0.6523 with 0 ≤ h < 0.632 m
(18)CHF = 0.501h2 + 0.0565h + 0.7647 with 0.632  h < 1.14 m
(19)CHF = 1.49 with h ≥ 1.14 m

Results of base cases
In this section, the results of heat load from four configurations of molten pool to VVER-1000 lower head wall, the corium thickness bounding oxidic pool and the remaining thickness of VVER-1000 lower head wall are presented in Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12.

Fig. 10 demonstrates the heat fluxes on external surface of VVER-1000 lower head vessel imposed by four configurations of molten pool. The trend of all the heat flux profiles were resemble with MIVR model’s prediction of head load on VVER-440 lower head wall. The lowest point of lower head wall suffered the lowest heat load from molten pool, and then the heat load increased along the curvature of lower head wall. The first step increase of heat load imposed to cylindrical boundary of oxidic pool also observed in the transition position from elliptical boundary to cylindrical boundary. The degree of increase was unequally because there were differences in decay heat power density deposited in oxidic pool of four configurations.
The second increase, at the transition from oxidic pool to metallic layer, known as focusing effect caused by a thin metallic layer, was observed as well. The position of transitions of MP1, MP2 and MP4 were closely because the heights of oxidic pools were approximately equal. Whereas, the height of MP3′s oxidic pool was shortest, therefore, the transition occurred at the lowest position among configurations. Fig. 10 also shows, due to differences in deposited decay heat power density and the metallic layer thicknesses, the intensive heat loads imposed by four configurations were different. The heat intensive caused by metallic layers are clearly visible for MP1 and MP3. Meanwhile, the increased heat loads imposed by metallic layers of MP2 and MP3 make a tiny difference compared to increased heat load imposed by oxidic pool to the cylindrical boundary. The results show the MP1 imposed the largest intensive heat load on VVER-1000 lower head vessel with the heat peak of 0.78 MW/m2, followed by MP4 with the heat peak of 0.75 MW/m2. The third and the last are configuration MP3 and MP2 with the peak of 0.69 and 0.5 MW/m2 respectively.
By comparison between heat loads caused by MP1 and MP3 configurations, it can be seen that the energy partition in the oxidic pool of MP1 and MP3 configurations are the same, but there is a difference in heat load imposed by the metallic layer. Although there was a heat source in the metallic layer of MP3 configuration, its heat load on lower head wall was lower than that of MP1, due to the fact that the metallic layer of MP3 configuration is thicker than that of MP1 configuration. The comparison also points out that a heat source deposited in the thick metallic layer is not challenging case for IVR strategy.
Fig. 10 also shows all heat flux peaks caused by four configurations are totally much lower than the critical heat flux (CHF). Therefore, in this case, with the large safety margin provided by the current CHF, the IVR strategy for VVER-1000 reactor is feasible. The thickness of oxidic crust corresponding to each configuration can be seen from Fig. 11. The oxidic pool of MP4 configuration imposed the highest heat load to the VVER-1000 lower head vessel compared to others (Fig. 10), so the thickness of the crust is expected the thinnest. Similarly, but inversely, the oxidic pool of MP2 configuration imposed the lowest heat load, thus the thickness of its oxidic crust is expected the largest. As seen from Fig. 10, the heat loads imposed by oxidic pool of MP1 and MP3 configurations are the same, so the predicted thicknesses of the oxidic crust in two configurations are the same.
As conjugated to heat load and oxidic crust thickness, the remaining thickness of VVER-1000 lower head wall, demonstrated in Fig. 12, shows a compatible result. The locations of VVER-1000 lower head next to the metallic layer suffered the highest heat load in all configurations, thus the remaining thickness of lower head at the locations was observed to be thinnest. Under the highest heat load imposed by MP1, the remaining thickness of lower head in this case was smallest, and the thinnest was 4.89 cm. A little bit thicker, the thinnest thickness of lower head wall corresponding to MP4 configuration was predicted to be 5.09 cm. In case of MP3 configuration, the thinnest thickness of lower head wall was obtained as 5.58 cm, and as a result of bearing the lowest heat load imposed by MP2 configurations, the thinnest of VVER-1000 lower head wall was 7.62 cm, which is the thickest among the thinnest remaining thickness of lower head vessel.
In the Section 2, two issues, which were achieved through comparative calculation of two MIVR models, were the effect of cylindrical boundary on energy partition of oxidic pool captured by MIVR1 model and the increase of heat load imposed to the cylindrical boundary predicted by MIVR1 model led to reduce heat load inserting to the lower head wall from the metallic layer in comparison with predictions of MIVR2 model. In order to clearly see the issues, the predictions of MIVR models on heat loads imposed to VVER-1000 lower head wall from four configurations are presented in Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The notations as MP1, MP2, MP3 and MP4 are results predicted by MIVR1 models. The notations with the commas on up-right corners as MP1′, MP2′, MP3′ and MP4′ are predicted by MIVR2 model.

Fig. 14. Heat flux distributions imposed by MP2 and MP3 configurations on external VVER-1000 lower head wall predicted by MIVR1 and MIVR2 models.
Fig. 13 shows the predictions on heat load caused by MP1 and MP4 configurations which did not have decay heat power deposited in the metallic layer. The results show clearly the increase of heat loads on the cylindrical boundary from the oxidic pool predicted by MIVR1 model. In predictions of MIVR2 model, the VVER-1000 lower head wall bore the higher heat load imposed by the metallic layer compared to predictions of MIVR1 model. The MIVR2 model predicted heat peaks inserted by the metallic layer of MP1 and MP4 configurations were 1.03 and 1 MW/m2 respectively, which were higher than predictions of MIVR1 model which were 0.78 and 0.75 MW/m2, respectively. Predictions on heat load caused by MP2 and MP3 configurations which contained decay heat power in metallic layer are shown in Fig. 14. Similarly, Fig. 14 shows the effect of cylindrical boundary was captured in MIVR1 model, and the heat peaks imposed by metallic layers of MP2 and MP3 configurations respectively predicted by MIVR2 model were 0.618 and 0.739 MW/m2 which are higher than the values of 0.503 and 0.688 MW/m2 predicted by MIVR1 model.

Parameter study on radiation emissivity of metallic layer
There are still existing uncertainties in the emissivity coefficients applied for the metallic layer. The emissivity coefficients vary from 0.2 to 0.45 depending on temperature and ingredient of metallic layer. An emissivity coefficient value of 0.45 was used in Theofanous et al. (1996), whereas Rempe et al. adopted a value of 0.29. Recently, Carénini et al., (2019) has mentioned a range of various emissivity coefficients between 0.2 and 0.4 which has been used in different IVR benchmark codes in an outcome from benchmark calculation of the European H2O2 IVMR project.
In this section, a parameter study on the emissivity coefficients of metallic layer is done for configurations of molten pool, MP1 and MP4 configurations, which imposed the highest heat load to VVER-1000 lower head wall. Four additional values of the emissivity coefficient, accompanied by value of 0.45 in the base case, are chosen as 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 in this study.
When the emissivity of metallic layer decreased, the heat loss through radiation reduced as well. Hence, the decrease of radiation will promote heat load from the metallic layer to lower head wall following the principle of energy conservation of the metallic layer. The trends of heat peaks corresponding to the emissivity coefficients imposed to lower head wall by MP1 (blue dots) and MP4 (red dots) configurations, displayed on Fig. 15 show conformableness. When the emissivity coefficients decreased, the heat peaks imposed to the lower head wall by MP1 and MP4 configurations increased. Particularly, heat peaks imposed by MP1 configuration increased from 0.78 to 1.21 MW/m2, and that of MP4 configuration rose from 0.75 to 1.05 MW/m2, corresponding to the decrease of emissivity coefficients from 0.45 to 0.0. The values of heat peaks corresponding to the emissivity coefficients imposed by MP1 and MP4 configurations are specifically given in Table 7.

<Section>4. Concluding remarks</Section>
The paper presented the MIVR model which was extended based on the original In-Vessel Retention model proposed by Theofanous et al. (1996) with the aim of taking effect of torospherical lower head vessel of VVER-1000 reactor into consideration. The remarkable of the MIVR model was presented through the comparative calculation of heat load from a quasi-steady state two-layer molten pool on the VVER-440 lower head vessel, and then MIVR was used to analysis of IVR strategy for VVER-1000. Few conclusions were given as follows:
-
The comparative calculation proved the applicability and confidence level of the MIVR models to predict heat load from a steady-state two-layer molten pool to torospherical shaped lower head vessel of VVER reactors. In addition, the effect of cylindrical boundary on energy partition of oxidic pool, which presented an increase of heat load from oxidic pool to cylindrical boundary, was captured in the MIVR models. The increase contributed to reduce concern on focusing effect caused by the metallic layer;
-
The MIVR models were applied to analyze IVR strategy for VVER-1000 through prediction about heat loads from four configurations of molten pool predicted by MELCOR v2.2, SOCRAT/B1, ASTEC v2.1 and ASTEC v2.0r3. The results showed all the heat loads were much lower than the Critical Heat Flux (CHF). Therefore, the IVR strategy is feasible to VVER-1000 reactor in this case;
-
The results of MIVR calculations pointed out a thick metallic layer with deposited decay heat power seemed not to be challenging case for IVR strategy applied for VVER-1000;
-
The parametric study on emissivity coefficients for two most challenging configurations showed that even the emissivity coefficients were ignored the heat peaks imposed by the two configurations were still lower than the CHF. This indicated the safety margin provided by the CHF would provide confident base for further studies on IVR application for VVER-1000 reactors;
-
Furthermore, the study also points out that unification of decay heat power in severe accident codes is an important issue in study of IVR strategy in general cases, and for VVER-1000 in particular.
