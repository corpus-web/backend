<Section>Abstract</Section>
Neutron or proton irradiation induced dislocation loops in Zr and its alloys are usually characterized by electron microscopy methods. In plastically deformed materials X-ray line profile analysis (XLPA) is now a well-established tool to determine dislocation densities (DDs) with excellent agreement between XLPA and TEM analysis. In irradiated zirconium alloys, however, XLPA determined DDs are often considerably larger than those obtained by TEM. In ion irradiated Cu and W it was shown that X-ray diffraction or MD simulations give significantly larger dislocation loop densities than conventional TEM analysis, which suggests that the smallest loops remain undetected by TEM. Based on these results we developed a new methodology to determine power-law size-distributions of irradiation-induced dislocation loops. We assume that only loops larger than a certain threshold are fully counted in TEM micrographs, whereas XLPA detects all the loops in the entire size range. This new analysis procedure shows that in neutron irradiated Zircaloy-2 in the channel-box materials the total DD is larger than in the cladding materials, even though TEM counting shows the opposite. We also found that there is a correlation between the reciprocal square-root of <a>-loop DDs and the diameter of <a>-loops. Our work shows that irradiation induced loop-formation and irradiation-damage in general can be better determined when we combine TEM investigations with XLPA.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Structural materials used in the core of fission reactors or in future applications for fusion reactors are generally exposed to high levels of neutron bombardment producing vacancy-interstitial cascades. Although 2/3 of the point defects generated in this way recombine, a large number of vacancies and interstitials are retained in the lattice and form clusters evolving into dislocation loops [1, 2]. These defect structures are known to have a profound impact on mechanical performance and dimensional stability of the material and components. Developing alloy compositions where such defect structures can be minimized or improving our understanding of different damage mechanisms requires reliable quantification of defect structures. To date, such characterization has mainly relied on (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) [2,3,4] and MD simulation [1,2,[5], [6], [7]], while x-ray diffuse scattering has also been used in a few cases [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].
In the case of plastically deformed materials X-ray line profile analysis (XLPA) has proven to be a successful tool to provide numerical results of dislocation densities (DDs) [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] in very good agreement with TEM results [21]. An example of that is in Fig. 1a showing DDs vs. shear stress determined by TEM [21] and XLPA [18,19]. X-ray line profiles were evaluated by using the Krivoglaz-Wilkens theory of strain broadening caused by dislocations [22], [23], [24]. In contrast, DDs of irradiated materials determined by TEM or XLPA show significant discrepancies, where the XLPA values are often much larger than those counted by TEM [10,[24], [25], [26], [27]]. The difference between the XLPA and TEM determined DDs in neutron irradiated Zircaloy-2 specimens is shown in Fig. 1b. The dislocation structures produced by plastic deformation or irradiation are fundamentally different. Fig. 1c and d show TEM micrographs of dislocations in a Cu single-crystal tensile deformed to the shear strain of τ=75 MPa [21] and the dislocation loop structure in a Zircaloy-2 specimen proton irradiated to 2.3 dpa at 280 °C [28]. Plastic deformation usually creates long lattice dislocations with strain fields of long-range character. Irradiation, however, induces dislocation loops with diameters ranging typically from about a few tenths to hundreds of nanometers with strain fields changing from short- to long-range character correlating with loop size.

Size-distribution determination of irradiation-induced dislocation loops (IIDLs) is one of the key issues in damage assessment in Zr-alloys in the nuclear industry. Dederichs [8,9] developed the single-defect approximation (SDA) to obtain the size-distribution of IIDLs. In the SDA it is assumed (i) that the strain fields around irradiation-induced dislocation loops are well separated, (ii) that the loops are randomly distributed and (iii) that the generated scattering can be calculated without taking into account interaction between strain fields. These assumptions hold as long as the loops are small and randomly distributed. These conditions are satisfied when irradiation dose-levels and irradiation temperatures are both relatively low [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. In the experiments of Dederichs [9], Larson & Young [11] and Ehrhart & Averback [12] high purity, defect free single crystals were irradiated at temperatures not higher than room temperature and diffuse X-ray scattering was determined around the fundamental Bragg reflections by rocking-curve measurements in three-crystal high resolution diffractometers. Specimens investigated in the present work are polycrystalline commercial Zr alloys with an average grain size of about 10 μm, proton or neutron irradiated to substantially higher dose levels at significantly higher temperatures than the ones studied in [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Harte et al. [14] showed that loops generated at dose levels and temperatures around operating conditions of nuclear power plants align along certain crystallographic directions indicating strong interaction between the strain fields. IIDLs in our specimens do not comply with the conditions required for the SDA, therefore we use the convolutional multiple whole profile (CMWP) method [29] to determine the total dislocation density and the dipole-character of IIDLs. When small dislocation loops (SDLs) are in abundance, satellites may appear in the tail regions of diffraction peaks. In a recent work we extended the CMWP method for evaluating powder diffraction patterns where SDLs generate satellites [30]. In the present work we determine the total dislocation density in neutron or proton irradiated Zr alloys by the extended CMWP method and show that the difference between DDs obtained by XLPA or TEM can be used to obtain the size distribution of IIDLs even when loop densities are extremely large as in structural alloys irradiated under operational conditions in nuclear power plants.
<Section>2. Experimental</Section>
2.1. X-ray diffraction and TEM experiments
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected at the I11 synchrotron beamline of the Diamond Light Source, UK [31]. The monochromatic parallel beam was operated at 15 keV with the wavelength of λ=0.08259 nm. The proton irradiated specimens were tested at a fixed shallow incident angle of 5° in order to obtain diffraction from the plateau region of damage calculated by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) profile [32] ranging to about 20 μm below the specimen surface and to have x-ray sampling approximately from the same depth as the TEM investigations. Diffraction patterns of the neutron irradiated samples were done on TEM foil specimens in transmission mode. TEM micrographs were obtained in a FEI Talos X-FEG 80–200 KeV microscope, operated at 200 kV with a probe current of 590 pA. The STEM imaging was done at the  @ zone axis and all defects that became invisible at g = 0002 were counted and measured as <a>-loops, where g is the diffraction vector and <a>-loops are dislocation loops on the prismatic planes with Burgers vectors 1/3 @[23,30]. More details about the X-ray diffraction and TEM experiments can be found in [27,28].
2.2. Specimens
We investigated six neutron- and five proton-irradiated Zircaloy-2 specimens. The neutron irradiated specimens were electro-polished TEM foils taken from fuel assemblies used in Swedish BWRs and provided by Westinghouse Electric Company and Studsvik Nuclear AB [33]. Four specimens were taken from cladding (tubes that encapsulate the nuclear fuel) and two from channel boxes (guide for the boiling water). The estimated temperatures experienced by the cladding material was 350 (±10) °C while the channel boxes materials were approximately at 300 (±10) °C as they don't sit right next to the fuel. More details about the neutron irradiated specimens can be found in [26,32]. Proton irradiation was carried out partly at the Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory at the University of Michigan, USA, using a 1.7 MeV Tandetron accelerator [34] and partly at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility (DCF), University of Manchester, UK [28]. Recrystallized bars were irradiated along the normal direction using 2 MeV protons at a current of ~20 μA cm−2. The samples were irradiated to the level of about 2.3 dpa at 280 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C and to 4.7, and 7 dpa at 350 °C. Damage rates were calculated by using the SRIM software package, assuming pure Zr with a displacement energy of 40 eV [28,32]. More details about the proton irradiated specimens can be found in reference [28].
2.3. A brief summary of the CMWP method
The theory of X-ray line broadening, the basis of the CMWP method, has been reviewed in the literature [24,29,35,36]. Here we shall only discuss the aspects necessary for understanding the present work. The Fourier transform of strain broadened profiles is given as [37]:
@(1)
where g is the absolute value of the diffraction vector, L is the Fourier variable, 〈@〉 is the mean square strain (mss). For dislocations the mss was developed by Wilkens [24]:
@(2)
where ρ and b are the density and the Burgers vector of dislocations, C is the dislocation contrast factor, η=L/Re, and Re is the effective outer cut-off radius of dislocations. The f(η) function is logarithmic for small and hyperbolic for large η values. The value of Re depends on the dislocation density, therefore it is better to use the dimensionless number, M=Re@. The value of M characterizes the dislocation arrangement or the dipole character of dislocations. For correlated dislocation arrangements or when the dipole-character is strong: M ≤ 1, whereas for random dislocation arrangements or when the dipole-character is weak: M>>1. In the first case the strain-filed of dislocations is of short-range, whereas in the second case it is of long-range character, respectively. Due to reciprocity of crystal and reciprocal space, when M ≤ 1 the short-range strain fields produce long diffraction-peak tails, whereas when M>>1 the long-range strain fields produce short diffraction-peak tails. The contrast factor, C, accounts for strain anisotropy depending on the relative orientation between the Burgers and line vectors, b and l of dislocations and the diffraction vector, g. In polycrystals or powder diffraction patterns the hkl dependence is averaged over the permutations of hkls [38]. For hcp crystals the average contrast factors in the CMWP method are [39]:
@(3)
where@
and a and c are the hcp lattice constants. The contrast factors for dislocation loops in Zr were calculated by Balogh et al. [40]. Size broadening is taken into account by the size profile calculated by assuming log-normal size distribution of the coherently scattering domains [29,35]:
@(4)
where @ and @ are the median and the variance in the log-normal size distribution function and erfc is the complementary error function. Profile functions of size, strain and instrumental effects are convoluted in the standard manner. Further details of the CMWP method can be found in [29,35].
2.4. Special issues in line broadening caused by irradiation-induced dislocation loops
Dislocation structures produced by plastic deformation or irradiation are very different as the TEM micrographs in Fig. 1c and d show. The differences in X-ray line broadening generated by plastic deformation or irradiation are summarized as three issues. (i) Peaks profiles can have longer tail regions from irradiated than from plastic deformed specimens with M values smaller than unity shown in Fig. 2a. (ii) Satellite peaks can appear in the tail regions of profiles as shown in Fig. 2b. (iii) The DDs can change by two orders of magnitude while the FWHM changes just by a factor less than 1.5 shown in Fig. 2c for Zircaloy-2 specimens proton irradiated to 2.3 dpa at different temperatures [28]. The CMWP method was extended recently to handle these challenges [30]. (a) When the dislocation density is in the 1016 [m − 2] range and M becomes smaller than unity, Re can approach the lower length-limit of continuum approximation. In order to prevent Re becoming smaller than this lower length-limit we introduced a user defined hard limit, Rc into the strain function f(η)=f[1/(Re+Rc)]. With the introduction of Rc the CMWP method has become robust even for very small M and very large ρ values at the same time. The M parameter is calculated as M=(Re+Rc). Taking into account the lower limit of the continuum theory approximation, which is around 5 to 20 atomic distances [41], Rc can be selected to be between 4 and 8 nm. Usually Re is around a few hundred nm, therefore in such cases Rc has no influence neither on the M parameter nor or the dislocation density. In the present work we used Rc=5 nm. More details of the effect of Rc are discussed in [30] where Fig. 3a shows the effect of Rc on M and ρ. (b) Satellite peaks around the fundamental Bragg reflections are generated by scattering from SDLs. In [30] it was shown that the size of SDLs, D, and the deformation maximum inside loops, |TrεMAX|, obey the reciprocal relation: D × |TrεMAX|≅0.34, where D is measured in Burgers vector units. Based on this relation the satellites are fitted in the extended CMWP method by profiles function of size-profile form as in eq. (4). The satellite profile functions are given by the median, msat and the variance, σsat of a log-normal size distribution function. The measured peaks are fitted as the sum of the main and the satellite peaks. The total dislocation density is evaluated from the main diffraction peaks independent of the satellite profiles.

<Section>3. Results</Section>
In [30] it was shown that the DDs of 〈a〉 and 〈c〉 loops can be determined separately by using the loop contrast factors determined by Balogh et al. [40] (see eqs. (14) and (15) in [30]). The <a>-loop DDs in the neutron and proton irradiated specimens determined by TEM (open up-triangles) and by XLPA (open circles) are shown in Fig. 3a. In all cases the XLPA values are larger than the TEM values. The only exception is the specimen proton irradiated at 450 °C where the DDs are in the 1013 [m − 2] range and the loop diameters are 50 nm or larger as shown in Fig. 3c in reference [28]. In the neutron irradiated specimens the TEM determined ρ values are smaller in the channel than in the cladding material, whereas the XLPA determined values show exactly the opposite trend. The ratios of the XLPA and TEM determined ρ values, ρCMWP/ρTEM, are shown in Fig. 3b. The figure shows that in the cladding materials the ratios are between 2 and 4, whereas in the channel materials they are between 10 and 20. Similar large discrepancy is found for the specimens proton irradiated to 2.3 dpa at 280 °C and to 4.7 dpa at 350 °C. At the same time, in specimens proton irradiated to 2.3 dpa the ρCMWP/ρTEM ratio decreases and approaches unity with increasing irradiation temperature. The TEM micrographs in Fig. 3 in reference [28] show that with increasing irradiation temperature the size of loops increases while the density decreases. The M parameter for the same specimens, the green column bars in Fig. 3c, increase with irradiation temperature from M = 0.94(±0.1) to M = 70(±15). In the neutron irradiated specimens (blue and red column-bars) the M values vary between 2.5 and 7 in the cladding- and between 1.2 and 1.5 in the channel-materials, respectively. For both the neutron and proton irradiated specimens the XLPA data show that at lower irradiation temperatures the DDs are larger and the M values smaller. The TEM micrographs of the proton irradiated samples show that at lower irradiation temperatures the loops are smaller with larger densities.
<Section>4. Discussion</Section>
Narayan and Larson [10] showed that smaller defect clusters in self-ion irradiated Ni are missed when counted in TEM micrographs and suggested power law or exponential function for the loop size-distribution based on X-ray diffuse scattering experiments. Larson and Young [11] investigated the IIDL size-distribution in copper single crystals irradiated by Cu ions. They found that, while dislocation loop counting in TEM micrographs becomes difficult below loop-diameters of about 2 nm, X-ray diffuse scattering catches all loops in the entire size distribution range. Similar conclusions were drawn from diffuse X-ray scattering studies of neutron- and electron-irradiated pure Ni and Cu and their dilute alloys with Si, Ge and Be [12]. The discrepancy between IIDL counting by diffuse X-ray scattering and TEM was summarized in [13] confirming the assumption of that loop size-distributions follow an exponential function. Yi et al. [42] irradiated high purity tungsten by W+ ions and studied the IIDLs by TEM and MD simulations. It was found that TEM counting of SDLs becomes unstable below about 2 nm loop diameters, while MD simulation showed that loops exist with diameters well below 2 nm.
While capabilities and spatial resolution of (S)TEM have improved greatly in recent decades, imaging small dislocation loops in complex and usually multiphase alloys has remained challenging due to the plenty of sources that provide contrast at the size range of particularly small loops [48]. Based on the numerical solution of the Howie–Basinski equation [43] of electron diffraction theory Zhou et al. [44] showed that images of loops smaller than about one nanometer blur up, limiting the visibility in TEM. This means that TEM micrographs capture loops reliably only above a certain minimum loop size. XLPA, however, catches loops in the entire size range. Based on the results of Larson and Young [11], Yi et al. [42] and Zhou et al. [44] and the consequently larger DDs given by XLPA than by TEM we propose the following method to determine the size-distribution of IIDLs. The diffuse scattering measurements [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] and the MD simulations [1,5,42,44] show that IIDLs have wide size distributions which can be well described by the power-law size-distribution density function (PL-SDDF)
@(5)
where D is the loop diameter, C is the normalization factor and n is the exponent of the size distribution function. The normalization factor is [45]:
@(5a)
where DMin is the lower truncation value of the size distribution, assuming that for D<DMin N(D)=0. The DDs given by XLPA and TEM, ρXLPA and ρTEM, can be obtained by the following integrals of N(D):
@(6)
@(7)
where DT0 and DX0 are the lower and DTM and DXM the higher truncation values of N(D) related to the TEM or XLPA data and A is normalizing the N(D) function to the measured dislocation density values. Eqs. (6) and (7) can be transformed to obtain A and n:
@(8)
@(9)
Eqs. (8) and (9) can be solved numerically once the truncation boundaries have been determined. Assuming that loops in Zr cannot be smaller than about 0.5 nm we use DX0=0.5 nm, cf. [5,[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],42,44,46]. Harte et al. determined the size distribution of loops in Zircaloy-2 proton irradiated to 2.3, 4.7 and 7 dpa at 350 °C [14]. The size distribution data (open squares for 2.3, open triangles for 4.7 and open circles for 7 dpa) are reproduced in Fig. 4, in double-logarithmic scale, taken from Fig. 13 in reference [14]. (The continuous size-distribution lines in the figure are discussed below.)
Fig. 4. Comparison of the PL-SDDFs obtained by the present method (XLPA/TEM) and determined by TEM investigations in three proton-irradiated specimens irradiated at 350 °C. The TEM data were taken from Fig. 13 in reference [14].
Harte's size distribution data in Fig. 4 are normalized to give the DDs obtained by TEM counting shown in Fig. 3a. The TEM size distributions show that below about Dloop≅5 nm the loop-density decreases sharply, contrary to diffuse X-ray [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] and MD simulation [1,5,42,46] results. Although features and contrasts considerably smaller than 5 nm can readily be observed in (S)TEM micrographs, loop counting in heavily irradiated commercial Zr alloys becomes uncertain below about Dloop≅5 nm because of the large density of IIDLs along with plenty of other sources providing contrast in the same smaller size range. We carried out a systematic analysis of the n and A parameters by varying the lower and upper loop size limits in wide ranges shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows that the upper truncation limit, DMAX, has no effect on the values of n or A. Figs. 5b and 5c show that the n and A values level off around DX0≅0.5 nm and DT0≅5 nm, the lower truncation values in the XLPA and TEM related size-distribution functions. Based on the physical and numerical considerations we evaluate eqs. (8) and (9) with the upper truncation value of DMAX,=DXM=DTM=100 nm and the lower truncation values of DX0=0.5 nm and DT0=5 nm, respectively.

(a) The effect of the upper truncation value, DMAX, on the n and A values at three different lower truncation numbers of the TEM data. (b) The effect of the lower truncation number in the TEM data on the n and A values at the X-ray truncation numbers, DX-ray-MIN=0.15 nm and DX-ray-MAX=100 nm. (c) The effect of the lower truncation number in the X-ray data on the n and A values at DTEM-MIN=2 nm and DTEM-MAX=100 nm. The vertical arrows indicate the selected truncation numbers.
The PL-SDDFs of <a>-loops for the neutron- and proton-irradiated specimens are shown in Fig. 6a and b in double logarithmic scales. The vertical arrows pointing to 5 nm indicate that TEM captures loops reliably above this loop size [10,13,40]. The horizontal arrows indicate the loop diameter ranges captured by TEM or XLPA. Since TEM does not count all the loops below a certain critical loop diameter [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],42] a large fraction of small loops are missing from the ρTEM value and therefore the ρXLPA can be larger than ρTEM. Two qualitative features can be observed from Fig. 6a: (a) that the PL-SDDF lines of channel materials are steeper than those of the cladding materials, (b) that the lines of cladding and channel materials are crossing around the loop diameter of about 8 nm, close to the lower-limit of loop-diameter for TEM counting, DT0=5 nm. The figure shows that below DT0 the size-distribution lines of the channel-box materials deviate steeply above the lines of cladding materials, indicating that small dislocation loops are in large abundance in channel-box, compared to cladding materials. The large number-density of small loops in the channel-box materials accounts for the large total dislocation density in the XLPA data. As Fig. 6a shows, above DT0 the size-distribution lines of the channel-box materials are well below the lines of the cladding materials. As a result, TEM DDs are smaller and XLPA DDs larger in the channel than in the cladding materials, whereas the relation between the two DDs in cladding materials is just the opposite.
Fig. 6. Size-distribution density functions, N(D), of irradiation-induced <a>-type dislocation loops in (a) neutron- and (b) proton-irradiated Zircaloy-2 specimens. The vertical arrows indicate that TEM counting of dislocation loops is most reliable above the loop size of about 2 nm diameter. Eqs. (7) and (8) were evaluated with this lower limit of integration for TEM counted loops.
The PL-SDDFs of <a>-loops in the proton-irradiated specimens are shown in Fig. 6b. The effect of irradiation dose and temperature on the DDs and loop size-distribution can be summarized as follows. (1) Two specimens were irradiated to the same level of 2.3 dpa, one at 280 °C the other one at 350 °C. Fig. 3b shows that the ρCMWP/ρTEM ratio in the two specimens are about 14 and 1.5. Accordingly, the PL-SDDF line of the 280 °C irradiated specimen (blue line in Fig. 6b) is much steeper than that of the one irradiated at 350 °C (red line in Fig. 6b). The two size-distribution lines are crossing at about D≅100 nm, a much larger loop diameter than the lower truncation (DT0=5 nm) of the TEM size-distribution. Therefore, both the XLPA and the TEM DD values are larger at the lower irradiation temperature, as shown in Fig. 3a. (2) The figure also shows that in the specimens proton irradiated to 4.7 and 7 dpa the TEM DDs are smaller whereas the XLPA DDs are larger than in the 2.3 dpa samples. The size-distribution lines of the 4.7 and 7 dpa specimen are crossing the 2.3 dpa line around D≅20 nm, not too far from the lower truncation (DT0=5 nm) of the TEM size-distribution. Accordingly the TEM DDs become smaller while the XLPA DDs larger in the higher dose samples. This apparent inconsistency as a function of irradiation dose is similar to the one observed as a function of irradiation temperature in the neutron irradiated specimen of channel-box and cladding materials.
The correlation between the PL-SDDF and TEM determined size distribution of <a>-loops in proton irradiated specimens is shown in Fig. 4. The figure shows a reasonable correlation between the size-distribution lines and the TEM data above about 5 nm loop diameter. Below that value the TEM data indicate a rapid decline of loop numbers. There is, however, strong indication in the literature [1,5,[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],42,46] that substantial loop densities of smaller diameter exist in irradiated Zr alloys, the counting of which is not easy in TEM micrographs [48], especially in commercial Zr alloys when the loop densities are large.
The role of the crossing point in the size-distribution lines is shown schematically in Fig. 7. The TEM micrographs of Zircaloy-2 specimens show that, at the same dose level, at lower temperature smaller loops are induced with larger density [28] (see Fig. 3 in reference [28]). The red and blue areas in Fig. 7a indicate that TEM DDs are smaller when the size-distribution line is steeper and the crossing-point is not too far from the lower truncation in the TEM size-distribution. At the same time, the red and blue areas in Fig. 7b indicate that the XLPA DD can be much larger than the TEM value when the steeper size-distribution line is higher in the small loop size range. The schematic plot applies either to the DD values and relations in the neutron irradiated specimen where the channel-box material operates at a temperature about 50 °C lower than the cladding material [47], or to the DD values and relations in the specimens proton irradiated to 2.3 or 4.7 and 7 dpa at 350 °C. When the size-distribution lines are crossing far from the lower truncation of the TEM size-distribution, as shown by the green dash-line and the vertical dash-dot arrow, then the XLPA DDs will be larger than the TEM DDs either as a function of irradiation temperature or as a function irradiation dose.

(a) The blue and red shaded regions above the lower truncation value in the TEM size-distribution, DT0=5 nm, indicate areas proportional to loop numbers counted in TEM micrographs. (b) The blue and red shaded regions indicate areas proportional to loop numbers not counted in TEM micrographs. The vertical dash and dash-dot arrows indicate crossing points of size-distribution lines. The blue or red lines are for loop size distribution in specimens irradiated either at lower or higher temperatures, or to higher or lower dose levels, respectively. The green dash-line is an alternative to the blue line. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
The average loop diameter, , can be given as:
@(10)
where i stands for X or T in the case of XLPA or TEM data and DMAX=100 nm for both, the XLPA and TEM values. The solution of Eq. (10) is:
@(11)
The @ values determined by the above equation, related to the XLPA (blue bars) and TEM (red bars) data, are plotted in Fig. 8 in logarithmic scale. The figure shows that the average loop-diameter obtained from eq. (11) is smaller at lower irradiation temperatures, in good correlation with TEM results, cf. [28,47].

In [30] it was shown that the 〈a〉 and 〈c〉 loop fractions of the total DD can be separated on the basis of the measured contrast factors. Using the DDs related to <a>-loops a good correlation can be established between the XLPA <a>-loop DDs, ρX<a>, and the <a>-loop diameters using the sigmoid function:
@(12)
where the coefficients are αX = 0.75, βX = 1.9, γX = 0.18 and δX = 29 for the XLPA and αT = 8.2, βT = 7.5, γT = 0.25 and δT = 27 for the TEM average <a>-loop diameters, respectively. The correlation between the average <a>-loop-diameters (obtained from the PL-SDDFs) and the reciprocal square-root of <a>-loop dislocation-densities, 1/@, are shown in Fig. 9. The lines through the data-points are according to eq. (12). The figure indicates that both the XLPA and TEM average loop-diameters correlate with the reciprocal square-root of average <a>-loop dislocation-densities, 1/@, and are decreasing with increasing dislocation density. Eq. (12) and Fig. 9 suggest that <a>-loop formation starts with the appearance of large <a>-loops. Intuitively one would expect the opposite. Therefore, if irradiation damage starts with the formation of small <a>-loops then there must be a cut-off in the dislocation densities before eq. (12) and Fig. 9 start to apply. Large <a>-loop formation at the very beginning of irradiation damage can, however, be conceived by the following scenario. In the earliest stages, within irradiation cascades, diffusion is probably largely enhanced preferring growth. This would allow <a>-loops to grow freely as long as the matrix is empty. In a later stage proximity to other loops will limit loop size, decreasing the average <a>-loop diameter and increasing the dislocation density. However, further experiments are needed in order to clarify loop-structure evolution at the very beginning of irradiation damage. In [27, 28] and [30] it was found that the M parameter correlates with loop diameters. This means that small loops have strong dipole character with small M values, whereas with increasing loop size the dipole character decreases along with increasing M values. Establishing a quantitative correlation between the M values and loop-diameters needs further research to know the averaging procedure of the M parameter with varying loop diameter and changing loop nature.

Correlation between the average <a>-loop diameters and the average dislocation distance related to <a>-loops, 1/ρ, where the dislocation densities are given by the CMWP procedure, (a) for XLPA and (b) for TEM data. The three open red-circles are obtained from the TEM determined size-distributions of <a>-loop diameters in Fig. 13 in reference [14] taking into account the lower truncation in the present size-distribution evaluations. The equations are for the lines through the data-points. The vertical lines indicate typical error margins.

<Section>Conclusions</Section>
Using the differences in dislocation densities determined by XLPA or TEM we developed a method to determine loop size-distributions in neutron or proton irradiated Zr alloys. The method is corroborated by results of MD simulations and X-ray diffuse scattering experiments on different irradiated materials. These methods reveal that significant irradiation-induced loop densities exist in the small loop-diameter region where counting of loops in TEM micrographs appears to be difficult, especially in commercial Zr alloys when the loop densities are large.
Numerous neutron, proton or metal ion irradiation experiments suggest that IIDLs have wide size-distributions. Based on these results we have developed the method to determine the parameters in PL-SDDFs, the exponent, n and the normalization factor, A, normalizing the size-distributions to the dislocation density. We determined the lower truncations for the XLPA and TEM size-distributions, DX0=0.5 nm and DT0=5 nm, by using experimental values of loop-diameters available in the literature. The upper truncation value in the size-distributions has been selected to be the same for both the XLPA and TEM cases, DMAX=100 nm. A systematic investigation of the lower and upper truncation values indicates that the actual value of the upper truncation has absolutely no effect on n or A when it is larger than about 100 nm.
With our new concept to describe the wide size-distribution by PL-SDDFs explains the apparent inconsistency of counting smaller loop DDs by TEM in neutron irradiated channel-box than cladding materials while XLPA shows exactly the opposite relation. The much larger difference of DD values between XLPA and TEM data in channel-box than in cladding materials gives steeper PL-SDDFs for the channel-box than the cladding materials. The two sets of PL-SDDFs are crossing close to the lower truncation for the TEM size-distributions. Below the crossing point the size-distribution lines of the channel-box materials are rising well above the lines of the cladding materials indicating large abundance of small dislocation loops with large excess DDs not counted for in the TEM observations. The large excess loops in the lower loop-size range in channel-box materials is substantiated by TEM observations in proton irradiated zircaloy-2 according to which large loop densities with smaller size are induced at lower irradiation temperatures. Somewhat similar apparent inconsistency is observed as a function of irradiation dose at the same irradiation temperature. In zircaloy-2 specimens proton irradiated to 2.3, 4.7 and 7 dpa at 350 °C the TEM DD decreases from 2.3 to 4.7 and 7 dpa while the XLPA DD is substantially larger at 4.7 and 7 than at the 2.3 dpa dose level. Again, the size distribution lines for the 2.3 and the 4.7 and 7 dpa levels are crossing not too far from the lower truncation value of the TEM size-distributions. As a consequence, a large number of small loops are generated at higher dose not fully counted in the TEM micrographs and therefore, the corresponding DDs are smaller than the ones given by XLPA.
Based on the PL-SDDFs we determined the average loop diameters for the size distributions related to XLPA and TEM:  and . The average loop diameters, , correlate with the CMWP dislocation density, ρX, through a sigmoid function in which the variable is the average dislocation distance, 1/. We found that the average loop size decreases with DD.
In the present work we used the TEM DD values determined before it was realized that the apparent discrepancy between XLPA and TEM DD data can be used to obtain the size-distribution of IIDLs. Although the lower truncation of DT0=5 nm in the TEM size-distribution is well established, the TEM related DD values, used in the present evaluations, are probably somewhat larger than the values would be if they would have been determined explicitly above the DT0=5 nm truncation number. The procedure developed here can be deliberated into a more straightforward and accurate method where TEM counting is carried out decidedly above a certain truncation number.
