<Section>Abstract</Section>
Unsteady turbulence structures in and downstream of a short elbow (radius to pipe diameter ratio 1.0) were studied experimentally for sub-to-post-critical Reynolds numbers (Re = 1 × 105 to 3 × 105). Measurement of the velocity field was carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) combined with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis. The mean velocity, turbulence intensity, power spectrum, spatial variation of POD modes, and time variation of instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields were evaluated. The experimental results indicate that a separation region forms around the elbow exit, which is almost independent of the Reynolds number for the post-critical Reynolds numbers. The power spectrum analysis indicates that the periodic oscillation is observed at Strouhal number 0.5, and that it originates from interaction of the secondary flow in the elbow and the unsteady separating flow behavior near the exit of the inner elbow wall. Furthermore, POD analysis was conducted to clarify the variation of POD modes in the elbow flow. It was found that the periodic velocity fluctuation is generated by the oscillation of the flow in spanwise direction downstream of the elbow, which consists of a secondary flow structure directed to the inner elbow wall, and a streamwise longitudinal structure along the centerline of the elbow. The POD reconstructed velocity and vorticity fields indicate periodic oscillation of the entire secondary flow arising from unsteady oscillation of a pair of vortices in the cross section of the elbow; this condition prevails in and downstream of the elbow.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
The design of pipe elbows has been an important topic of interest in the nuclear power plant, because the pipe elbow saves the space in the power plant, particularly in reducing the plant construction costs and space by the use of short elbow. However, the flow-induced vibration is a concern in power plant design using the short elbow arising from the unsteady fluid forces caused by turbulent flow through the elbows (Shiraishi et al., 2006, Ebara et al., 2010, Ono et al., 2010, Yamano et al., 2011). On the other hand, the wall-thinning of the nuclear plant piping system is another concern associated with flow-accelerated corrosion, which is the phenomenon by which iron ions diffuse from a carbon steel pipe into the bulk flow. The studies on the wall-thinning of the power plant have been carried out actively in recent years, in relation to the mass transfer phenomenon in pipes with elbows (Achenbach, 1976, Mazhar et al., 2013, Ikarashi et al., 2017, Taguchi et al., 2018, Utanohara and Murase, 2019) and that with orifices (Sydberger and Lotz, 1982, Ahmed et al., 2012, Uchida et al., 2011, Fujisawa et al., 2012, Takano et al., 2016). These results demonstrate an importance of mass and momentum transfer studies on pipe elbows.
The 90° short elbow is a typical pipeline element having a radius-to-pipe-diameter ratio of 1.0 and has been studied from the perspective of pressure loss in the elbow (Ito, 1987, Spedding et al., 2004). However, recent studies on the flow in and downstream of elbows have provided more detailed insight into the flow physics. The flow through the elbow is known to separate from the inner wall of the elbow at the large curvature arising from the adverse pressure gradient over the inner wall of the elbow (Dutta et al., 2016, Ikarashi et al., 2018). This results in intensified secondary flow in and downstream of the elbow due to the centrifugal forces acting on the flow through the elbow. It has been noted that the secondary flow moves from the inner wall to the outer wall of the elbow through the elbow centerline, and it returns to the inner wall again via return flow along the side walls of the elbow. Therefore, the flow through a short elbow exhibits complex turbulence structure due to the occurrence of secondary flow and to the formation of a separation region on the inner wall of the elbow (Ikarashi et al., 2018, Ikarashi and Fujisawa, 2019).
The flow through an elbow can be categorized into three regimes: the sub-critical (Re ≤ 1 × 105), transitional (1 × 105 < Re < 2 × 105), and post-critical (Re ≥ 2 × 105) regions based on the Reynolds number of the pipe flow (Idelchik, 1986). In nuclear/fossil power plants, the flow through the pipes is mostly under the post-critical regime (Re ≥ 2 × 105). Therefore, a new design methodology for pipelines including elbows and for flow under the post-critical Reynolds number regime is a much-needed next step in power plant design. Recent studies on the flow through a short elbow shows that periodic pressure oscillation is detected around the Strouhal number St (= fd/U0) = 0.5, where d is the pipe diameter, f is a frequency, and U0 is the bulk velocity. This periodic oscillation is known to be caused by shear layer instability originating from flow over the inner wall and this may increase the risk of flow-induced vibration in the power plant. Such vibration could be magnified when the natural frequency of a piping system interacts with the oscillating frequency of the flow. Therefore, the unsteady characteristics of the flow through a 90° short elbow have been studied experimentally using frequency analysis of the fluctuating pressure (Shiraishi et al., 2006, Ebara et al., 2010, Takamura et al., 2012, Iwamoto and Yamano, 2014), fluctuating velocity by laser Doppler velocimetry (Iwamoto et al., 2012), and particle image velocimetry (Ono et al., 2010, Ono et al., 2017) in the post-critical Reynolds number range Re ≥ 2 × 105. These experimental results show that the flow oscillation arises from the shear layer instability of the flow and that it results in generation of a peak frequency at Strouhal number 0.5, which is defined as the high frequency oscillation. However, the physical mechanism of the high frequency oscillation is still not clear, and this may be related to the complexity of the unsteady flow structure through the elbow.
On the other hand, very large-scale structure can be generated downstream of an elbow, which results in low frequency oscillation of the pipe flow when the Reynolds number is sub-critical (Rütten et al., 2005, Guala et al., 2006, Hellström et al., 2011, Kalpakli and Örlü, 2013). The formation of such very large-scale structure may cause oscillation of the flow through the elbow in clockwise and counter clockwise rotation with strength varying in time (Carlsson et al., 2015). The Strouhal number of such very large-scale structures ranges from 0.01 to 0.07 (Kalpakli et al., 2015), which frequency is one order lower than the high frequency oscillation at St = 0.5. The very large-scale structure of the low frequency oscillation is several times larger than the pipe diameter, so that it is difficult to detect such structure by standard pressure measurements using differential pressures (i.e., one downstream of the elbow and the other upstream of the elbow) (Shiraishi et al., 2006, Ebara et al., 2010, Iwamoto and Yamano, 2014). In order to resolve a flow structure covering such low-to-high frequency oscillation, flow field measurement using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in combination with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis provides a method for resolving the frequency spectrum in the flow field (Hellström et al., 2013, Kalpakli and Örlü, 2013, Noorani and Schlatter, 2016, Hufnagel et al., 2018, Jain et al., 2019).
The purpose of the work reported in this paper was to study the unsteady characteristics of the flow through 90° short elbows with flows within the sub-to-post critical Reynolds number range (Re = 1 × 105 to 3 × 105) using PIV combined with POD.
<Section>2. Experimental apparatus and procedures</Section>
2.1. Experimental set-up
The experiments on the velocity field in and downstream of an elbow were carried out in a closed-circuit water tunnel, which is illustrated in Fig. 1. The water tunnel consisted of a pump, a settling chamber, and a flow developing section before entering the test section with a short elbow. The length of the straight inlet pipe was 1,340 mm (=24 d), where d (=56 mm) was the diameter of the pipe. This water tunnel was built with reference to that used in previous experiments on elbow flows at low Reynolds number (from Re = 3 × 104 to 1.5 × 105) (Ikarashi and Fujisawa, 2019). To conduct experiments at higher Reynolds number, the original pump was replaced by a high-power pump (7.5 kW) and the volume of the settling tank enlarged (to 0.3 m3). The radius-to-diameter ratio of the short elbow was r/d = 1.0 (r: radius of the elbow curvature). The temperature of the working fluid (water) was kept constant at 298 K during the experiment using a temperature controller. Therefore, the Reynolds number of the flow through the elbow was set to Re (=U0 d/ν) = 1 × 105 to 3 × 105 (U0: bulk flow velocity, ν: kinematic viscosity of water), which covers the sub-to-post-critical Reynolds number ranges of pipe flow. These correspond to those of a prototype model of a nuclear/fossil power plant.

2.2. PIV measurements
Fig. 2 illustrates the planar PIV measurements of the flow through the test elbow made of acrylic material for flow visualization. Three cross-sectional planes were considered for measurement, one along the elbow axis in the elbow curvature plane along centerline (x-y plane), one parallel to the elbow axis apart from the inner wall at y/d = 0.15 (x-z plane), and one perpendicular to the elbow axis at x/d = 0.25 (y-z plane). These measurement planes were selected by referring to the flow separation from the second half of the inner wall and reattachment immediately downstream of the elbow.
Fig. 2. PIV measurement setup at the test elbow.
The measurements of the velocity field were carried out using the planar PIV system, which consisted of a CCD camera (1,008 × 1,018 pixels, 8 bits in gray level, 30 frames/s), Nd:YAG double pulse laser (70 mJ/pulse) and a pulse controller. The exposure time of the pulsed laser was 6 ns. The spatial resolution is set to approximately 16 pixels/mm. and the sampling rate is 15 samples/s. On the other hand, a time-resolved planar PIV system consisted of a high-speed CMOS camera (1,024 × 1,024 pixels, 12 bits in gray level, 6,400 frames/s), CW Nd: YAG lasers (output power 8 W) and a pulse controller, which was used for spectrum analysis of the velocity fluctuations and high-speed PIV measurement. The examples of exposure and interframe times are 0.08 ms at Re = 2 × 105, and the sampling rate is 100 samples/s with the spatial resolution 13 pixels/mm.
In the experiment, light-sheet illumination was provided perpendicular to the flat outer wall of the test section and the observations were made perpendicular to the illumination. This minimizes the influence of refraction index differences at the curved interface. The thickness of the light sheet was set to 2 mm. The traversing device allows the positioning of the light-sheet with an accuracy of 0.1 mm. Furthermore, to minimize the image deformation effect, a calibration procedure was introduced using a calibration sheet with equidistant square meshes with 2.5 mm sides. The details of calibration procedure have been described by Ikarashi et al., 2018. The flow visualization was carried out using nylon tracer particles 40 μm in diameter having specific gravity of 1.02. These were added to the flow in the settling tank upstream of the pump. Total number of 16,384 PIV images were taken at the frame rate corresponding to St = 2. The captured images were analyzed to obtain velocity vectors using cross-correlation analysis with sub-pixel interpolation. The interrogation window size was set to 31 × 31 pixels with 50% overlap (Kiuchi et al., 2005).
The statistical properties of the mean and fluctuating velocities were evaluated based on 8,192 instantaneous velocity fields. The maximum pixel displacement of the particle images was approximately 4 pixels in the velocity measurement, which resulted in a number of invalid velocity vectors (less than 1% of the total) in the PIV measurements. It should be mentioned that the uncertainty in velocity measurement using pulsed lasers was estimated to be 4.9% at a 95% confidence level with respect to the maximum velocity (PIV error 3.2%, image deformation error due to refraction index difference 3.8%), which is the cases of light sheet along the main flow direction. Note that the uncertainty increases near the wall because of image deformation error arising from the refractive-index-difference effect between the wall material and working fluid. The details of uncertainty analysis of PIV and image deformation errors are described by Wieneke, 2015, Ikarashi et al., 2018, respectively. Note that the uncertainty in PIV measurement increases up to 22% due to the influence of out-of-plane motion, when the light sheet is located perpendicular to the main flow direction. Nevertheless, this experimental technique has been used for detecting the secondary flow motion in the flow through the elbows in literature (Ono et al., 2010, Jain et al., 2019) because of the robustness. Note that the introduction of stereo PIV is not easy to the present experiment because of the presence of the large fluid forces at high Reynolds number flow acting on the experimental setup. On the other hand, the uncertainty of PIV measurements using CW laser is larger than that of the pulsed-laser PIV, because of the increased particle sizes caused by the longer exposure time, which is 0.08 ms at Re = 2 × 105. The uncertainties are estimated to be 5.4% (Re = 2 × 105) in the cases of light sheet along the flow direction, while it increases to 35% (Re = 2 × 105) in the case of light sheet perpendicular to the flow direction.
To confirm the validity of PIV measurements by high-speed camera with CW laser, the mean velocity and turbulence intensity were shown in Appendix as Fig. A-1, Fig. A-2, respectively. Note that these results are shown for x-y, x-z and y-z planes at Re = 2 × 105 in comparison with the pulsed laser measurements in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6. These results indicate that the mean velocity and turbulence intensity contours taken by the CW laser agree with those of the pulsed-laser, suggesting the validity of present measurements.

2.3. POD analysis
Two-dimensional snapshot POD analysis was introduced to process 8,192 instantaneous velocity fields taken by the planar PIV system in and downstream of the elbow. The basic idea of snapshot POD analysis is that it yields a set of orthogonal eigenfunctions that are optimal in energy, thereby representing temporal and spatial correlations of instantaneous velocities. Such POD analysis allows evaluation of the mean velocity field (0th POD mode) and the fluctuating velocity field (1st, 2nd, … POD modes). The fundamentals of snapshot POD analysis have been described by others (Berkooz et al., 1993, Hellström et al., 2011, Fujisawa et al., 2015, Kalpakli et al., 2015), so that the description is not repeated here. In the present study, reconstruction of the instantaneous velocity field was conducted with the first 20 among the POD modes to minimize the number of invalid velocity vectors. It should be mentioned that the two-dimensional POD analysis shows a limited value for the study of three-dimensional structure of the flow field in comparison with the three-dimensional POD analysis (Hufnagel et al., 2018), while it provides fundamental information on the target flow field as used in literature (Hellström et al., 2011, Fujisawa et al., 2015, Kalpakli et al., 2015).
<Section>3. Results and discussion</Section>
3.1. Inlet velocity condition
Fig. 3 show the inlet distributions of mean velocity and streamwise turbulence intensity, respectively, at x/d = -1, for three Reynolds numbers (Re = 1 × 105, 2 × 105, and 3 × 105). The mean velocity distributions agree approximately with each other, while the mean velocity near the wall tends to increase slightly with increase of the Reynolds number from Re = 1 × 105 to (2–3) × 105. On the other hand, the streamwise turbulence intensity at the center of the pipe was 6% of the maximum mean velocity, and this increased to 10% as the pipe wall was approached.
3.2. Mean velocity in and downstream of the elbow
Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show mean velocity contours on three cross-sectional planes (x-y, x-z, and y-z planes, respectively), which were measured by the planar PIV in and downstream of the elbow. Each result is shown at three different Reynolds numbers (Re = 1 × 105, 2 × 105, and 3 × 105). The mean velocity contour in the x-y plane (Fig. 4) shows that the flow accelerated along the inner wall of the elbow near the inlet, while the flow separated from the wall near the middle of the elbow. This was followed by flow reattachment immediately downstream of the elbow. As a result, a flow separation region formed from around the second half to the exit of the elbow. These mean-velocity-contour features in and downstream of the elbow were almost independent of the Reynolds number, but there was a noticeable change in the separation and reattachment points in and downstream of the inner wall, when the Reynolds number increased to more than Re = 2 × 105. That is, the separation region shortened when the Reynolds number was post-critical, which mainly came from delay of the separation point at higher Reynolds number. With further increase in the Reynolds number (to Re = 3 × 105), the separation region was slightly enlarged but the size of the change was small.
A similar feature was also observed in the cross-sectional mean-velocity distribution on the x-z plane at y/d = 0.15 in Fig. 5. The results indicate that the low velocity region is formed just apart from the inner wall downstream of the elbow at three Reynolds numbers. However, the low velocity region was enlarged at lower Reynolds number (Re = 1 × 105) reflecting earlier separation in the mid region of the inner elbow wall. For the post-critical Reynolds numbers (Re = 2 × 105 and 3 × 105), the mean velocity contours behave similarly and a downstream shift of the separation point is observed, which results are similar to those in Fig. 4.
Fig. 6 shows the cross-sectional mean velocity contours on the y-z plane perpendicular to the elbow axis downstream of the elbow at x/d = 0.25. Note that the in-plane velocity is roughly half that of the streamwise velocity. The results indicate that the mean secondary flow directs from the outer wall to the inner wall along the side walls, and that low velocity prevails along the inner wall because of the formation of a stagnation region near the inner wall and the flow moves to the outer wall through the center of the elbow. Therefore, the formation of secondary flow motion is observed on the cross-sectional plane of the elbow, which features a high flow velocity alongside the inner wall and a low-velocity region along the outer wall. It seems that the flows along the side wall are magnified and the low velocity region along the outer wall are enlarged at post-critical Reynolds numbers. These results suggest that the secondary flow structure is slightly modified under the influence of post-critical Reynolds numbers, which is closely related to suppression of the separation region in and downstream of the inner elbow wall.
3.3. Turbulence intensity in and downstream of the elbow
Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show the cross-sectional turbulence intensity contours in and downstream of the short elbow at three Reynolds numbers (Re = 1 × 105, 2 × 105, and 3 × 105). The streamwise turbulence intensity contour on the x-y plane at Re = 1 × 105 (Fig. 7) shows high magnitude of turbulence intensity along the shear layer originating from the separation point on the inner wall. This is induced by the large velocity gradient along the separating shear layer. With increase in the Reynolds number to the post-critical range (Re = (2–3) × 105), the magnitude of turbulence intensity decreases near the inner wall and the turbulence region becomes small because of the downstream shift of the separation along the inner elbow wall. It should be mentioned that these variations of turbulence intensity in the post-critical Reynolds number are mainly caused by downstream shift of the separation along the inner wall, which was similarly observed in the mean velocity field in Fig. 4.
Fig. 7. Cross-sectional turbulence intensity contour in and downstream of the elbow on the x-y plane (z/d = 0).
Fig. 8. Cross-sectional turbulence intensity contour downstream of the elbow on the x-z plane (y/d = 0.15).
Fig. 9. Cross-sectional in-plane turbulence intensity contour downstream of the elbow on the y-z plane (x/d = 0.25).
The cross-sectional turbulence intensity contour on the x-z plane (z/d = 0.15) at Reynolds number 1 × 105 (Fig. 8) shows the formation of high turbulence intensity near the exit from the elbow. It elongates downstream of the elbow and expands in the spanwise direction to z/d = ±0.2. This elongated structure behaves like the horseshoe vortices downstream of the elbow caused by the interaction of the secondary flow from the side walls toward the inner wall and the flow separation region near the centerline of the elbow. The magnitude of the turbulence intensity increases with increasing Reynolds number to 2 × 105, but remains roughly the same at the higher Reynolds number (Re = 3 × 105). The position of the high turbulence intensity shifts downstream with increase in the Reynolds number from Re = 1 × 105 to (2–3) × 105. This is because the turbulence intensities are generated by the flow separation originating from the inner elbow wall.
Fig. 9 shows the cross-sectional in-plane turbulence intensity contour on the y-z plane (x/d = 0.25) at three Reynolds numbers. These results indicate that high turbulence intensities were observed near the inner wall and that the high intensity region expanded from the elbow centerline in the spanwise direction along the side walls of the elbow. This indicates the interaction of the separating shear layer and the side wall flow toward the inner wall of the elbow, which originates from secondary flow through the elbow. It should be mentioned that the in-plane turbulence intensity increases near the inner elbow wall and that the region of low turbulence intensity expands to cover more of the outer wall when Reynolds numbers are post-critical (Re = (2–3) × 105). This is consistent with observations of the in-plane mean velocity field on the y-z plane (Fig. 6).
Fig. 10 shows variation of the separation and reattachment points on the inner elbow wall over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re = (3–30) × 104), which were obtained from the near-wall PIV measurement (Oguma and Fujisawa, 2007). Please note that the previous experimental results at lower Reynolds number by Ikarashi and Fujisawa (2019) are also plotted in this figure, which involves Reynolds numbers of (3–15) × 104. The experimental results indicate that the separation point moved downstream from 35° to 75° and the reattachment points shifted upstream from xr/d = 0.70 to 0.25 with increase in the Reynolds number from sub-critical to post-critical. However, they stayed near 75° and xr/d = 0.25, respectively, in the post-critical range (Re = (2–3) × 105). These results indicate that a narrow separation region exists near the elbow exit with post-critical Reynolds numbers (Re = (2–3) × 105) and that the width of the separation region is almost independent of the Reynolds number. These results are consistent with observations of the mean velocity contour (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and the turbulence intensity contour (Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). It is expected that the downstream movement of the separation point and the subsequent variation of reattachment point can be caused by the laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer on the inner elbow wall with increasing Reynolds number from sub-critical (Re = 1 × 105) to post-critical one (Re = (2–3) × 105).
Fig. 10. Downstream variation of flow separation and reattachment points in and downstream of the elbow.
3.4. Power spectrum in and downstream of the elbow
Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show the power spectrum of the streamwise velocity fluctuations at (x/d = 0, y/d = 0.15), (x/d = 0.25, y/d = 0.15) and spanwise velocity fluctuations at (x/d = 0.25, y/d = 0.15) on the centerline, respectively, in the Reynolds number range Re = (1–3) × 105. Note that x/d = 0 corresponds to the end of the elbow and x/d = 0.25 is around the point of flow reattachment downstream of elbow with high turbulence intensity. These spectra were obtained from 8,192 instantaneous velocity fields from the PIV measurements. The power spectrum (Fig. 11) in Re = 1 × 105 shows a higher power spectrum in the low frequency range that decreases gradually with increasing Strouhal number. With increasing Reynolds number to Re = (2–3) × 105, the spectrum in the lower frequency range tends to increase and that in the higher frequency range decrease. This result suggests that the low-frequency fluctuation is intensified and the high-frequency fluctuation suppressed for post-critical Reynolds numbers. However, there is no clear peak in the low frequency spectra within the range of measurement, which indicates the unsteadiness of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in the flow through the elbow (Kalpakli et al., 2015, Ono et al., 2017).

Fig. 12. Power spectrum densities of streamwise velocity fluctuations downstream of the elbow (x/d = 0.25, y/d = 0.15, z/d = 0).
Fig. 13. Power spectrum densities of spanwise velocity fluctuations downstream of the elbow (x/d = 0.25, y/d = 0.15, z/d = 0).
Fig. 12 shows a power spectrum of the streamwise velocity fluctuations downstream of the elbow at three Reynolds numbers. In this case, the power spectrum collapsed on a single line and it had a clear peak at St = 0.5 for all the Reynolds numbers. This peak was expected to come from flow oscillation downstream of the elbow, which is the location of the high turbulence intensity contours in Fig. 8. A detailed analysis of the flow oscillation based on POD is described in the following 3.5 POD modes in and downstream of the elbow, 3.6 Time-series observations of the velocity and vorticity fields). It was noted that the peak magnitude did not change with the Reynolds number within the range of measurement; however, the peak magnitude was even smaller than that of the lower frequency fluctuation. These results indicate that the high-frequency oscillation at St = 0.5 is generated in the separating shear layer downstream of the elbow; however, a wider spectrum was observed in the streamwise velocity fluctuation in the lower frequency range. Nevertheless, the low-frequency spectrum did not indicate clear peak in the low frequency range similar to the result in the elbow in Fig. 11.
Fig. 13 shows the power spectrum of the spanwise velocity fluctuation downstream of the elbow at three Reynolds numbers. This shows a high peak in the power spectrum at St = 0.5, which agrees with the result of streamwise velocity fluctuations in Fig. 12. However, the low-frequency spectrum of the spanwise velocity fluctuation is much lower than the streamwise velocity fluctuation in Fig. 12, which results in the formation of high-frequency peak in the spectrum. This result demonstrates that the high-frequency oscillation at St = 0.5 shows a dominant peak in the power spectrum arising from the secondary flow behavior through the elbow.
3.5. POD modes in and downstream of the elbow
Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16 show the 1st and 2nd POD modes of the velocity fluctuations in the x-y, x-z, and y-z planes, respectively, at three Reynolds numbers (Re = 1 × 105, 2 × 105, and 3 × 105), which were obtained from POD analysis of 8,192 PIV velocity data in and downstream of the elbow. Note that the color contour shows the normalized energy magnitude of each POD mode. Generally speaking, the magnitude of the 1st POD mode was much higher in magnitude than that of the 2nd POD mode. Therefore, the main features of the flow through the elbow are determined by the 1st POD mode, while the 2nd POD mode provides the flow feature related to the unsteady vortex behavior in the elbow.

Fig. 14 shows the 1st and 2nd POD modes of the velocity fluctuations in the elbow on the x-y plane at three Reynolds numbers. The peak fluctuating energy of the 1st POD mode distributes along the separating shear layer originating from the flow separation, which is similar to that seen in the turbulence intensity contour in Fig. 7. With an increase in the Reynolds number, the peak fluctuating energy increases and its position shifts closer to the wall, reflecting the suppression of flow separation near the inner wall of the elbow. The peak of the 1st POD mode is located downstream of the elbow along the separating shear layer originating from the inner elbow wall. Note that the point of flow separation moves downstream with increasing the Reynolds number from Re = 1 × 105 to Re = 2 × 105, while the downstream variation is decreased at higher Reynolds number. Corresponding to the variation of flow structure with the Reynolds number, the fluctuating energy level increases from 16.9% (Re = 1 × 105) to 24.0% (Re = 2 × 105) and 23.8% (Re = 3 × 105). This indicates the transfer of fluctuating energy to the shear-layer interface consistent with the laminar to turbulent transition of the separating shear layer. On the other hand, the structural change of turbulence in the elbow is more clearly observed in the 2nd POD mode in Fig. 14. This can be the result of laminar to turbulent transition of the separating shear layer. With increase in the Reynolds number, the peak fluctuating energy in the 2nd POD mode increases near the reattachment point at x/d = 0.2–0.3.
Fig. 15 shows the 1st and 2nd POD modes of the velocity fluctuations downstream of the elbow on the x-z plane at three Reynolds numbers. The 1st POD mode shows the presence of large-scale structure on both sides of the centerline of the elbow. The large-scale structure exhibits streamwise longer structure with the peak fluctuating energy at x/d = 0.2–0.4 downstream of the elbow (Re = 1 × 105), but it increases with increase in the Reynolds number (Re ≥ 2 × 105). However, the spanwise position of the peak fluctuating energy remained in the region z/d = ±0.20 along the elbow centerline independent of the Reynolds number. Note that the streamwise long structure consists of flow motion directing downstream on one side and upstream on the other side. Therefore, the instantaneous velocity fluctuation along the elbow shows opposite flow direction with respect to the centerline. On the other hand, the peak fluctuating energy of the 2nd POD mode is situated around x/d = 0.3 along the centerline of the elbow in the post-critical Reynolds numbers, which is a different feature from the sub-critical Reynolds numbers. These results indicate the influence of Reynolds number on the turbulence structure of the flow through the elbow.
Fig. 16 shows the 1st and 2nd POD modes of the in-plane velocity fluctuation on the y-z plane (x/d = 0.25) downstream of the elbow at three Reynolds numbers. These results indicate that the in-plane velocity fluctuation is higher along the inner wall and that a rotating flow exists in the cross-sectional plane along the inner wall of the elbow. The result showed a rotating flow in a counter-clockwise direction, but the flow direction varied case-by-case in the analysis. Therefore, the rotating flow direction in the cross section of the 1st POD mode is random. With increase in the Reynolds number, the fluctuating energy of the 1st POD mode increases in the cross section of the elbow, especially near the centerline and along the side walls of the inner wall. This result is consistent with the observation of turbulence intensity contours in Fig. 9. The corresponding 2nd POD mode shows clockwise rotation along the inner wall of the elbow, which is opposite direction to that of the 1st POD mode. However, the 2nd POD mode shows opposite rotation direction near the outer wall of the elbow.
3.6. Time-series observations of the velocity and vorticity fields
To understand the unsteady behavior of the large-scale structure of the flow through the elbow, the periodic oscillation of the velocity fluctuation in the flow downstream of the inner wall was detected by the high-speed PIV and the results were shown by reconstructing the velocity fields from the first 20 POD modes of the PIV data at the post-critical Reynolds number Re = 2 × 105. The PIV measurements were carried out every 5 ms to resolve the unsteady flow behavior of oscillations observed at high frequency (St = 0.5).
Fig. 17 shows time-series variation of velocity and vorticity contours of the large-scale structure for a period of 35 ms, which is approximately a cycle of high-frequency oscillation (St = 0.5). Note that the color contour shows the magnitude of the vorticity, which is dimensionless by the mean velocity and pipe diameter. Detailed examination shows that oscillation of the large-scale structure arises from side flow on upper side of the inner wall, which magnifies the positive vorticity with increasing the elapsed time (Fig. 17(a) to (d)), which is followed by the opposite side flow on the lower side with negative vorticity (Fig. 17(e) to (h)). The interaction of the pair of vortices along the inner wall of the elbow prevails across the whole cross section of the elbow, contributing to unsteady secondary flow through the entire cross section. Therefore, the high-frequency oscillation prevails on the entire inner wall of the elbow and generates unsteady secondary flow motion in the elbow. This may result in flow-induced vibration of the elbow and the pipeline, when the high frequency oscillation matches the natural frequency of the pipeline.
Fig. 17. Time-variation of reconstructed velocity and vorticity fields downstream of the elbow on the y-z plane (Re = 2 × 105).
Fig. 18 shows the corresponding time variations of 1st and 2nd POD mode coefficients of the velocity fluctuations on the inner wall of the elbow for the time period of 150 ms. Note that the first 35 ms corresponds to the reconstructed flow fields variation in Fig. 17. The results indicate the periodic variation of POD mode coefficients with time, which suggests the presence of flow oscillation on the inner wall of the elbow consistent with the flow observations in Fig. 17. However, the flow oscillation is highly suffered from the random flow motion under the influence of highly turbulent flow.

<Section>4. Conclusions</Section>
To understand the unsteady behavior of the flow through a short elbow, velocity measurements using time-resolved planar PIV combined with POD analysis were carried out at high Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 × 105 to 3 × 105, which covers the sub-to-post-critical Reynolds numbers. Experimental results were shown for the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, power spectrum, POD modes, and time-series velocity and vorticity contours. A high-frequency oscillation was observed in the power spectrum at the Strouhal number 0.5 of spanwise velocity fluctuation independent of the Reynolds number. This oscillation arises from downstream of the elbow, originating from a flow separation and reattachment. The separating flow region is shifted downstream with increasing the Reynolds number, which can be caused by the laminar to turbulent transition of the separating shear layer on the inner wall at post-critical Reynolds number. On the other hand, low-frequency fluctuations were observed in the lower frequency domain of the power spectrum without clear peaks, which was independent of the Reynolds number.
The POD analysis showed that the high-frequency oscillation of the velocity fluctuation arises from the unsteady behavior of the secondary flow, which results in the magnification of 1st POD mode and the fluctuating energy along the shear layer at post-critical Reynolds numbers. However, the variation of the flow structure is more clearly seen in the 2nd POD mode reflecting the structural variation of separating flow.
The POD reconstruction showed that the unsteady periodic motion is generated on both sides of the inner elbow wall, which results in a pair of large-scale vortices downstream of the elbow. The vorticity contour oscillates near the inner elbow wall at high frequency (St = 0.5). These results reveal that high-frequency oscillation exists in short elbows at post-critical Reynolds numbers. Moreover, this oscillation occurs in the entire cross-section of the elbow flow due to formation of large-scale unsteady secondary flow.
