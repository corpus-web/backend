<Section>Abstract</Section>
Helium cooled solid breeder blanket as an important blanket candidate of the Tokamak fusion reactor uses ceramic pebble bed for tritium breeding. Considering the poor effective thermal conductivity of the ceramic breeder pebble bed, thin structure of tritium breeder pebble bed is usually adopted in the blanket design. The container wall has a great influence on the thin pebble bed packing structure, especially for the assembly of mono-sized particles, and thin pebble bed will appear anisotropic effective thermal conductivity phenomenon. In this paper, thin ceramic pebble beds composed of 1 mm diameter Li4SiO4 particles are generated by the EDEM 2.7. The effective thermal conductivity of different thickness pebble beds in the three-dimensional directions are analyzed by three-dimensional thermal network method. It is observed that thin@Li4SiO4@pebble bed showing anisotropic effective thermal conductivity under the practical design size. Normally, the effective thermal conductivity along the bed vertical direction is higher than the horizontal direction due to the gravity effect. As the thickness increases from 10 mm to 40 mm, the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed gradually increases.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Nuclear fusion can provide sustainable clean energy for industrial and social life, Tokamak is a typical device for nuclear fusion energy applications [1]. Tritium is the fuel for nuclear fusion energy and is very expensive, to realize the commercial application of fusion energy, tritium must be self-sustained. Tritium is mainly produced by the breeder blanket in the fusion reactor, so the design of the breeder blanket is a key task. Helium cooled solid breeder blanket is an important candidate option for breeder blanket design, and the breeder material is often used in the form of lithium-based ceramic pebble bed [2]. Different from the material of continuous medium, the heat transfer of the pebble bed is affected by both the particles and the filling gas. The heat transfer capacity of the pebble bed is expressed by a certain parameter, which is called the effective thermal conductivity. Considering the poor effective thermal conductivity of the ceramic breeder pebble bed, suitable extraction temperature of tritium and the solid blanket needs to be operated at a safe temperature window, the design thickness of tritium breeder pebble bed in the typical helium cooled solid breeder blanket is thin, about 10–25 mm [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. For thin ceramic pebble bed, the influence of the container wall on the pebble bed packing structure cannot be ignored [7,8], which may result in anisotropy in effective thermal conductivity.
At present, many studies on the effective thermal conductivity of the tritium breeder pebble bed pay more attention to experimental measurements [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], theoretical derivation [[15], [16], [17], [18]] and numerical simulation methods [19,20], and pay little attention to the impact of the container wall on the pebble bed. Actually, the container wall has a big influence on the packing structure, effective thermal conductivity and mechanical property if the size of the pebble bed is too thin.
Numerical simulation is more feasible for the research of the anisotropy effective thermal conductivity than experimental measure. DEM has proven to be a good method for studying pebble bed packing and mechanical properties [7,8,[21], [22], [23]], so the pebble bed composed of mono-sized particles is generated by DEM in this paper. Due to the complex structure of the pebble bed, the conventional thermal-fluid-solid coupling method is difficult to apply to the solution of the temperature distribution of the pebble bed. Fortunately, a three-dimensional random network method has been proposed by G.K. Batchelor et al. [24] and Tae Sup Yun et al. [25] to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the packed granular system and this method has proved effective. After we obtained the random packed bed model by the DEM, the temperature distribution of the pebble bed can be analyzed based on the three-dimensional thermal network method, then the effective thermal conductivity will be calculated according to Fourier’s law.
In this paper, the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of thin@ceramic pebble bed is calculated by combining DEM and three-dimensional thermal network method. DEM analysis uses software EDEM 2.7, three-dimensional thermal network method is realized by MATLAB self-programming code. Referring to the size of pebble bed in the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) [[3], [4], [5], [6]], the diameter of@particles is 1 mm. For DEM model of the pebble beds, the thickness increase from 10 mm, and the other two directions are periodic boundary conditions. Based on the DEM and three-dimensional thermal network method, the effect of packing structure on anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of thin ceramic pebble bed is studied.
<Section>2. Methodology</Section>
The anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of thin@ceramic pebble bed is studied by combining DEM and three-dimensional thermal network method. The technical route is shown in Fig. 1 and the material properties used in the numerical simulation are shown in Table 1 below [15,21,[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. In discrete element simulation, due to the lack of experimental data and reference to literature, the friction coefficients for pebble-wall and pebble-pebble are set to 0.1 [15].
Fig. 1. Schematic of the technical route.
Table 1. Properties.
The pebble bed model is generated by DEM, the calculation process is shown in part “obtain random packed pebble bed model” in Fig. 1. In our simulation, the mechanical properties of the particles are called first, and then a certain amount of particles are generated on the top surface of container and dropped under the influence of gravity. Finally, analyze and obtain the coordinates of each particle in the pebble bed. The heat transfer simulation is solved by three-dimensional thermal network method, the calculation process is shown in part “Pebble bed heat transfer analysis” in Fig. 1. According to the obtained coordinates of each particle in the pebble bed, the heat transfer model of the packed pebble bed is reconstructed. After that, input the material’s thermal properties, set the boundary conditions, carry out the heat transfer simulation, and analyze the simulation results.
The effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed is affected by many factors, such as the properties of the particles and gas, thermal radiation, gas flow velocity. Considering the small temperature difference between particle surfaces, the influence of thermal radiation is not considered. In addition, the flow velocity of helium in the helium cooled solid breeder blanket is very slow, so the effect of convection heat transfer can be ignored [9]. Therefore, the properties of particle and filling gas and their combined effects on the thermal conductivity of the pebble bed have been studied in this study. In the simulation work, the DEM modeling did not consider the effect of temperature, the heat transfer simulation considered the effect of temperature. Considering that the purge gas pressure in the solid cladding is fixed, 1 bar is selected in this paper, so Smoluchowski effect is not considered.
<Section>2.1. Modeling pebble bed</Section>
DEM was proposed by Cundall and Strack in 1979 [23] to investigate the mechanical properties of the granular materials, it was based on Newton’s Second Law of Motion and the physical contact theory of particles [32]. Firstly, the mechanical properties of particles are defined, and a certain number of particles are generated by the particle factory, and then the particles fall and accumulate under the action of gravity. The kinetic energy of particles in the container is monitored during the falling of particles. When the kinetic energy is less than , the pebble bed is considered to reach a dynamic stable state [7], as shown in Fig. 2(a). The specific process of constructing random packed pebble bed model can be obtained in our previous work [7]. In DEM modeling, the effect of thermal expansion is not considered, and it is reflected by coefficient@in the process of heat transfer analysis.
Fig. 2. Pebble bed model. (a) Randomly packed pebble bed established by DEM, (b) Selected model for heat transfer simulation.
After we obtained the random packed bed model by the DEM, the heat transfer simulation of the pebble bed was carried out by the three-dimensional thermal network method. Because the number of particles contained in the pebble bed is too large, the calculation efficiency is seriously affected (Table 2). The red part of the pebble bed is selected for heat transfer simulation, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The simplified model takes into account the effect of thickness on the pebble bed packing structure, the other two directions of the pebble bed are still unaffected by the container wall, so it is reasonable and acceptable. In order to conveniently describe the three-dimensional pebble bed, the pebble bed is described in a Cartesian coordinate system, and the X, Y and Z directions are shown in Fig. 2. For pebble bed models with different thicknesses, the size in the Y-direction is changed.
Table 2. Number of particles in the pebble bed model.
2.2. Global thermal model
After the model for heat transfer simulation is obtained, the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of pebble bed is solved by three-dimensional thermal network method. For example, to solve the effective thermal conductivity of pebble bed along the Y direction, the boundary conditions are set in two walls along the Y direction, one side is fixed at a high temperature, the other side is fixed at a low temperature, referring to the work of M. Moscardini et al. [19], the temperature gradient between the two walls is set to 1K. The insulation boundary is set on the other four walls, the flow direction of the heat flux is shown in Fig. 3.

There are two phases coexist in the pebble bed, particle and gas. In the proposed thermal contact conductance model, the particles are interconnected by thermal resistors defined by the different types of thermal contact [19,24,25]. Assumed the heat transfer coefficient between the particle@and the particle@is@[W/K] (calculation method reference [25]), so the heat exchanged@between the two particles is:
@(1)
Ti [K] and@[K] represents the temperature of particle@and the particle , respectively. Similar situation, the total heat flux exchanged Q [J] between the particle@and all other particles in the pebble bed during the time@[s] can be obtained.
@(2)
T means the time step, the selected value in this paper is 0.1s. Therefore, the temperature of the particle@after the@is:
@(3)
[K] means the temperature after the update,@[K] means the temperature before the update,@[Kg] is the mass of the particle and@[J/Kg K] is the specific heat capacity. The calculation finished when the assembly reaches the steady state configuration satisfied Eq. (4). The ceramic pebble bed temperature distribution at different calculation times and eps as a function of iteration time are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. Fig. 4 represents the temperature distribution of the pebble bed at different iteration times, it can be seen that as the iteration time increases, the temperature distribution in the pebble bed tends to be stable. Fig. 4 shows that the pebble bed temperature distribution tends to be stable, but there is no quantitative standard, so eps is monitored for analysis. As the beginning of the iteration, the eps of pebble bed is very large in Fig .5. As the iteration progresses, the eps first decreases significantly and then gradually decreases and tends to a stable value.

Then, the effective thermal conductivity of the ceramic pebble bed can be obtained by Eq. (5).

@[W/m K] means the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed,@[J] means the heat flux through the high temperature wall, H means the thickness of pebble bed (If the solution is the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed in the Y direction, H is t he thickness of the pebble bed in the Y direction), A means the cross-sectional area,@[K] means the temperature difference between the high temperature wall and the low temperature wall.
2.3. Heat transfer model between particles
Section 2.2 introduces the global thermal model of the three-dimensional thermal network method, the calculation of@[J] is the key and has been proposed by Yun T S et al. [25]. There are two cases of heat transfer between particles in the pebble bed. One is that the two particles are in direct contact, and the other is that there is a gap between the two particles, as shown in Fig. 6.

Ri [m] and Rj [m] represent the radius of particles i and j respectively, Dij [m] represents the distance between the centers of the two particles, hij [m] represents the width of the particle gap, and rc means the radius of the particle contact surface.
It can be considered that the two heat transfer situations include three contact thermal resistances, two of which are the heat transfer thermal resistance inside the particles, and the other is the particle contact thermal resistance, as shown in Fig. 7 therefore:

@(17)
In order to verify the feasibility of the method, the analysis results are compared with experiments. Since the size of pebble bed used in the experiment can be considered infinite, the verified pebble bed model is taken from the portion of the interior of the pebble bed which is unaffected by the container walls. The verified pebble beds are@and , experimental data from Hongli Chen et al. [9] and Christopher Kang et al. [34], respectively. In addition, according to the experimental method, Hongli Chen used Hot Disk method to measure the thermal conductivity of the@pebble bed, which measures the thermal conductivity in the Z direction of the pebble bed. Kang measures the effective thermal conductivity in the radial direction of the@pebble bed, so the numerical calculation should correspond to it.
Fig. 8 is the comparison of experimental data and numerical simulation results of effective thermal conductivity of@pebble bed, and Fig. 9 is the comparison of experimental data and numerical simulation results of effective thermal conductivity of@pebble bed. The pebble bed is filled with 1 bar of helium and the temperature is from room temperature to 600 °C. It can be seen from Figs. 8 and 9 that the comparison results of the two kinds of pebble beds are better, and the maximum error is about 5%. Considering the measurement error and calculation accuracy, it can be considered that the three-dimensional thermal network method can be applied to the pebble bed heat transfer analysis.

<Section>4. Method application</Section>
4.1. Influence of the thickness of the pebble bed
In this section, the influence of the thickness on the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of thin@pebble bed is studied. The diameter of@particles is 1 mm, the thickness of the pebble bed studied in this paper varies from 10 mm to 40 mm in the Y direction, the lengths in the X and Z directions are both 10 mm. Since the thermal analysis model is selected from the complete model (detailed in section 2.1), the influence of the walls in the X and Z directions of the pebble bed can be ignored.
Fig. 10 shows the comparison of effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed in the X, Y and Z directions, while Fig. 11 shows the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed as a function of thickness. For the four different thickness pebble beds analyzed in this paper, the effective thermal conductivity increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the experimental measurements. The effect of temperature on the effective thermal conductivity of@pebble bed is significant. From Fig. 10 (a), the effective thermal conductivity in the Z direction is about 0.78 W m−1 K−1 at 100 °C and about 1.08 W m−1 K−1 at 600 °C.
Fig. 10. The comparison of effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed in the X, Y and Z directions (a) The thickness in the Y direction is 10 mm, (b) The thickness in the Y direction is 20 mm, (c) The thickness in the Y direction is 30 mm, (d) The thickness in the Y direction is 40 mm.
Fig. 11. The effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed as a function of thickness (a) Effective thermal conductivity in the X direction, (b) Effective thermal conductivity in the Y direction, (c) Effective thermal conductivity in the Z direction.
When the thickness of the pebble bed is 10 mm, the effective thermal conductivity in the Z direction is the largest, followed by the X direction, and the smallest is the Y direction. As the thickness increases to 40 mm, the effective thermal conductivity difference of the pebble bed in the X and Y directions gradually becomes smaller and disappears, but the Z direction is still the largest. It is known that effective thermal conductivity increases with increasing compressive pressure on granular beds [35]. The pebble bed is subjected to gravity along the Z direction in this study, the horizontal force of the pebble bed is smaller than the vertical direction, so the effective thermal conductivity in the Z direction is the largest. Both the X direction and the Y direction are in the horizontal direction, the difference in the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed is due to the influence of the container wall on the arrangement of the particles. As the thickness of the pebble bed increases, the influence of the container wall gradually decreases, so the effective thermal conductivity in the X and Y directions of the pebble bed gradually becomes consistent.
It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the effective thermal conductivity of the@pebble bed increases as the thickness increases, tends to be stable until the thickness is increased to 40 mm. The trend of the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed with same thickness at different temperatures can be considered consistent. Through analysis, the thickness has an effect on the effective thermal conductivity of pebble bed, especially when the thickness is thin. The combination of these factors leads to anisotropic effective thermal conductivity. Therefore, in analyzing the heat transfer of a thin@pebble bed (particle length/particle diameter less than 40), the effect of thickness cannot be ignored.
4.2. Influence of the coefficient of static friction between the particles
The manufacturing process of the tritium breeder particles affects the smoothness of the particle surface, resulting in a different coefficient of static friction between the particles. It has been found through previous studies that the roughness has a great influence on the packing structure of the pebble bed [7]. In this section, the influence of static friction between the particles on the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed is analyzed. The thickness of the@pebble bed is 30 mm. Considering the smoothness of@particle [36], the friction coefficient between the particles changes from 0.1 to 0.6 in this paper. The result is presented in Fig. 12. It is observed that as the coefficient of static friction between the particles increases, the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed in the X, Y and Z directions is decreasing. This phenomenon is due to that as the coefficient of friction increases, the packing fraction of the randomly packed pebble bed formed by the same packing scheme decreases. When the coefficient of static friction is 0.1, the packing fraction of the pebble bed is 0.624. When the coefficient of static friction increases to 0.6, the packing fraction of the pebble bed decreases to 0.605 [7]. According to the design criteria of the helium cooled solid breeder blanket, the temperature of the tritium breeder pebble bed needs to be maintained between 450 and 900 during the operation of the fusion reactor, therefore the tritium breeder pebble bed in the blanket is thin [37,38].@pebble bed has poor effective thermal conductivity, Fig. 12 shows that it is about 1.1 Wm−1K−1 at 600 °C. The surface smoothness of the particle affects the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed. In order to better ensure that the tritium pebble bed works at a suitable temperature, it is necessary to ensure that the particle surface as smooth as possible.

4.3. Average effective thermal conductivity
Sections 4.1 Influence of the thickness of the pebble bed, 4.2 Influence of the coefficient of static friction between the particles study the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed, and the research results play an important role in understanding the heat transfer characteristics of the pebble bed.
In this section, the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed with different packing structures obtained in the previous section is arithmetically averaged to obtain the average effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed, as shown in Eq. (18). The average effective thermal conductivity is shown in Table 3 and Table 4 below. However it needs to be pointed out, for the engineering application purpose, the lowest value of the thermal conductivity should be chosen rather than the average value, because y-direction thermal conductivity is lower than the average value. When we do the design and analysis, we have to take the conservative properties for the safety margin.

<Section>5. Conclusion</Section>
In this paper, the anisotropy in effective thermal conductivity of thin@ceramic pebble bed is studied by combining DEM and three-dimensional thermal network method. The conclusions obtained are summarized as follows:
(1)
The effective thermal conductivity along the bed vertical direction is higher than the horizontal direction due to the gravity effect.
(2)
When the thickness of the pebble bed is 10 mm, the effective thermal conductivity in the Z direction is the largest, followed by the X direction, and the smallest is the Y direction. As the thickness increases to 40 mm, the effective thermal conductivity difference of the pebble bed in the X and Y directions gradually becomes smaller and disappears.
(3)
As the coefficient of static friction between the particles increases, the effective thermal conductivity of the pebble bed is decreasing. In order to better ensure that the tritium pebble bed works at a suitable temperature, it is necessary to ensure that the particle surface as smooth as possible.
Study on the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the@pebble bed can provide the reference for helium cooled solid breeder blanket design, but the method adopted in this study can also be applied to other similar problem.
