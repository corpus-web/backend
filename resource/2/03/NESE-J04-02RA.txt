<Section>Abstract</Section>
Based on studies indicating that addition of soluble oxides to UO2 increased resistance of UO2 to oxidation to U3O8, PNNL investigated the effects of doping UO2 with several soluble lanthanide oxides and zirconium oxide on stabilizing UO2. PNNL reports here on how 0 to 10 wt% Gd2O3 content affected UO2’s resistance to thermally induced air oxidation, reaction kinetics, and kinetic mechanisms as measured using differential scanning calorimetry and simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis.
These studies found that 1) oxidation of UO2 proceeded via at least three steps rather than the commonly reported two, 2) increasing Gd content did not delay the oxidation onset temperature to U3O7/U4O9 but slowed this oxidation and delayed onset of the second oxidation to U3O8, 3) neat UO2’s first oxidation step at 325°C proceeded via 1st Order or Phase Boundary mechanisms rather than reported Diffusion and transitioned to Nucleation & Growth while the 2nd step proceeded via Nucleation & Growth and overlapped and transitioned to Phase Boundary rather than strictly the reported Nucleation & Growth, and 4) the kinetic mechanisms for the two oxidations depended on Gd content with the 1st proceeding via often overlapping Phase Boundary, Nucleation & Growth, and Diffusion mechanisms and the 2nd proceeding via often overlapping Nucleation & Growth, Phase Boundary, 1st and 2nd Order Chemical, and Diffusion.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
With the support of the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) investigated stabilizing Light Water Reactor (LWR) uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel by adding soluble oxides into the UO2 matrix. The concept leverages past studies’ results that have shown that addition of soluble impurities or dopants retarded or limited UO2 oxidation by air from the cubic UO2 to the orthorhombic U3O8 [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. This oxidation first converts UO2 to the cubic U3O7/U4O9 before air oxidizes it to the larger crystal tetragonal orthorhombic U3O8. PNNL's objective was to leverage the results of these past studies that indicate that addition of soluble oxides stabilizes the first oxidation product and inhibits the oxidation to U3O8.
As described by Leinders et al. [16,17], as UO2 oxidizes, the added oxygen incorporates or diffuses into the fluorite cubic crystal lattice to form UO2+x slightly displacing existing interstitial sites creating oxygen vacancies at normal sites. leaving the U sublattice undisturbed but causes the overall lattice to contract as the U is oxidized to U5+,6+, both of which have smaller ionic radii than U4+. This intermediate oxidation maintains the nominal fluorite cubic structure. This initial oxidation is usually considered to proceed via a diffusion mechanism. Further oxidation to the tetragonal orthorhombic U3O8 is considered to proceed via a nucleation and growth mechanism.
To determine if adding soluble oxides can be used to increase LWR UO2 fuel's stability, PNNL used thermoanalytical methods to investigate whether preventing or slowing the initial oxidation to the cubic U3O7/U4O9 or the second more structurally deleterious oxidation to the orthorhombic U3O8. Towards this end simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to measure the thermal sensitivities and kinetics of air oxidation of UO2 doped with 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mass% Gd2O3, Nd2O3, La2O3, CeO2 and ZrO2. As our first reporting of results, this paper focuses solely on our Gd2O3-doping studies.
Addition of trivalent Gd3+ to the UO2 matrix causes a slight disruption within the crystal. As Middleburg et. al. explain [18], to accommodate the introduction of a trivalent cation into the matrix, oxygen vacancies or trivalent interstitial ions form, and the U4+ oxidizes to U5+ to maintain charge neutrality. As for addition of O as UO2 oxidizes, the U4+ oxidizes to U5+ to maintain charge neutrality in the (U,Gd)O2 materials used in our testing.
Because of Gd's importance as a burnable neutron absorber [19], adding Gd to UO2 has been studied extensively to determine its effects on UO2’s physical properties [20], microchemistry [18,21], crystal structure [7], [15], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], heat capacity [28], thermal expansion [28], thermal conductivity [29] [22], electrochemical reactivity [24], and UO2 dissolution chemistry [30]. The authors refer the reader to the referenced papers for details of how Gd addition affects all these UO2 properties.
<Section>2. Experimental</Section>
The authors tested both commercial- and PNNL-fabricated pure and Gd-doped UO2 fuel pellets. PNNL procured the commercially available material from a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed fuel manufacturer and vendor's standard nuclear fuel stock. The research team determined 1) the oxygen-to-metal ratio (O/M) using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedure C-1430-00 [31]; 2) elemental distribution, physical appearance, and grain structure using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS); 3) chemical composition using X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD); and 4) lattice parameters using Reitveld refinement modeling of XRD patterns.
To assess the effects of dopants on stability of UO2 (delayed or prevented oxidation to U3O8), we measured thermal oxidation behavior using isothermal and non-isothermal simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA). The authors used non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the dopant concentration effects on the thermal reaction sensitivity and kinetics of the air oxidation of UO2 and to identify oxidation steps. To identify the gas/solid reactions mechanism(s) and to provide more insights into the relative effects of gadolinium doping, the authors compared 325°C isothermal TG results with models prepared from gas-solid kinetics and mechanisms provided by Sharpe et al. [32], Szekely et al. [33], Patisson and Ablitzer [34], Casella et al. [35], and Pijolat and Favergeon [36].
2.1. Test equipment and methods
An Amray 1610 SEM/EDS, a Scintag PAD V XRD with theta 2-theta configuration, and a Seiko DSC Model 220 and simultaneous Seiko Model 320 TG/DTA measured selected properties of the PNNL-prepared and nuclear vendor provided materials.
2.1.1. XRD analysis
We used XRD analysis to identify XRD-observed phases in the PNNL-prepared (Gd,U)O2 materials, to determine lattice parameters, and to provide the final uranium oxide identity and the oxidation products of selected (Gd,U)O2 samples from the thermoanalytical air oxidation studies.
For the XRD analysis, the crushed <44-µm powder was ground in amyl acetate with an internal standard for 2-theta calibration, Standard Reference Material (SRM) 676 corundum from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, mixed by grinding thoroughly with 2% collodion in amyl acetate solution, and a sample transferred to a glass slide. The XRD examination conditions were a range of 5 to 65 degrees 2-theta, step size 0.02 degrees 2-theta, count time 1.2 or 20 seconds per step, with the XRD tube operated at 45 KV and 40 mA, and slits at 4, 2, 0.5, and 0.3 mm.
The JADE software package identified the material's phases by comparison to XRD patterns in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database. The JADE Whole Pattern Fitting/Rietveld Refinement (WPF) processing mode provided the lattice parameters for multiple samples beginning with ICDD cards for U3O8 (Card 74-2104, orthorhombic), corundum (Card 75-1864, hexagonal), and UO2 (Card 5-550, cubic) and analyzed using JADE default running parameters. Duplicate slides were analyzed for selected samples. Typically, the lattice parameters were reproduced to within 0.1 pm. The combined uncertainty for lattice-parameter determination was found to be ±0.2 pm. In most cases, JADE did not report the calculated pattern as having converged. However, the residual versus iteration number plot was horizontal, indicating that no further improvement was being gained. The computed fit to the data was generally very good.
2.1.2. Thermoanalytical methods
To investigate insertion of Gd3+ (ionic diameter 105.3 pm) into the UO2 crystal on the thermal sensitivity of air oxidation of UO2, the team measured the thermal air-oxidation of PNNL-prepared 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 wt% Gd2O3-doped UO2 using 1) isothermal 325°C TGA, 2) non-isothermal DSC and TG/DTA to 700°C at 2°C/min, 3) isothermal 350°C TGA of PNNL-prepared 10% Gd2O3, and 4) both 325°C isothermal and 2°C/min non-isothermal TG/DTA of the nuclear fuel vendor-prepared Gd2O3-doped UO2. DSC experiments heat-up rates at near-isothermal conditions (0.15°C/min) up to 40°C/min to investigate whether the first oxidation for neat UO2 to U4O9/U3O7 would complete before the second oxidation step to U3O8 began and in an attempt to measure obtain Arrhenius kinetic parameters using differences in DSC peak maxima [37, 38]. The non-isothermal studies used a standard heating rate of 2°C/min to provide the sensitivity to observe changes in the reaction onset and peak maximum temperatures. Results are reported in terms of the oxygens associated with the U (OU) assuming a constant Gd3+ oxidation state.
To prepare the UO2 and doped UO2 pellets for thermoanalytical oxidation testing, the pellets were sectioned using a slow speed ISOMET saw to avoid or minimize air oxidation which begins near 140°C as presented later, crushed using a mortar and pestle, and sieved through a 44-μm sieve. Initial DSC testing found that sizing to <44 µm was necessary to observe the two step oxidation.
The TG experiments used a nominal 20 to 40 mg sample of the <40-µm-sized powder placed in an open aluminum, gold, or platinum pan and exposed to flowing air as the sample was heated at the programmed rate or tested isothermally after heating in air at 325°C/min. The DSC and TG/DTA were calibrated using melting point standards. To assess reproducibility, we performed duplicate TG analyses of the nuclear fuel grade UO2 obtained from the fuels manufacturer and found they differed at most 0.01 OU/U.
2.1.3. Kinetic analysis approach
Originally the authors intended to use the ASTM method [39] using multiple DSC heating rates to determine the Arrhenius reaction parameters for the two oxidation steps. However, early experiments found the reported two-step oxidation resolved into multiple reaction steps at faster heating rates as discussed in more detail later. To accommodate this more complex step-wise oxidation observed at faster heating rates, the authors chose to use a single temperature isothermal TG analysis coupled with model-fitting strategies described in the literature [33,36,40].
In these isothermal experiments, the TG/DTA rapidly heated the sample to the target temperature of 325°C at 325°C/min in air to minimize the time to temperature and to assure that isothermal oxidation conditions could be achieved rapidly. This initial heat-up took 6 to 10 min to stabilize with no temperature overshoot at 325±1°C oxidizing the U to 0.1 OU/U. The kinetic model fitting began after the temperature gradually slowed and after the experiment's start. Given that the initial mechanism transitioned to another, as will be discussed later in Results and Discussion, we originally considered trying to model the behavior using a blended model. This proved very challenging because the mechanism change could be due to oxidation of an intermediate product whose concentration was not known and thus difficult to blend mechanistic models.
2.2. Test materials preparation
PNNL prepared and tested UO2 and Gd-doped UO2 pellets containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 wt% Gd2O3 or 0.06-, 0.11-, 0.17-, 0.28-, 0.39-, 0.44-, and 0.55-mmol Gd/g, respectively using UO2 obtained from an NRC-approved nuclear fuel vendor specifically for fabrication of fuel pellets. For comparison testing, PNNL obtained Gd-doped UO2 fuel pellets prepared by a proprietary preparation method containing 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, and 6.0 wt% Gd2O3 or 0.08, 0.22, 0.32, and 0.38 mmol Gd/g, respectively from the same NRC-approved nuclear fuels vendor though our focus was on the PNNL-prepared materials.
To prepare the PNNL pellets, 1) approximately 20 g of UO2 were mixed with dopant oxide and water to thoroughly wet the mixture were added to a polyethylene bottle, 2) milled by tumbling with 5 zirconia mixing balls for 24 h on a rotating jar mill or rock tumbler, 3) vacuum dried overnight at 100°C, 3) prepressed at ~83 MPa in a standard 13-mm-diameter die to form pellets, 4) the pellets were broken and pressed through a 1.18-mm sieve, 5) the sieved material was pressed into final pellets at ~500 MPa, and 6) sintered at 1570°C in a 4% H2 dry atmosphere for 24 hours to assure that the dopant formed a homogeneous solid solution.
PNNL produced the target materials with a measured O:M ratio for selected pellets of 2.00±0.01. The SEM/EDS examinations of several fabricated UO2/dopant specimens found excellent elemental homogeneity. After etching a polished sample in hydrogen peroxide/sulfuric acid to make grains visible, examination by SEM found dry sintering produced nominal 2-μm grain sizes while sintering in humidified 4% H2 produced grain sizes of 20 µm comparable to the industry standard of about 10 to 20 μm; the dry-sintered materials were tested.
To maintain charge balance in (U,Gd)O2 due to the introduction of Gd3+, a portion of the U4+ oxidizes to U5+. This causes lattice contraction as also reported by Kim et. al. [7] and Ha et. al. [15]. The addition of the 105-pm ionic radius Gd3+ causes the 100-pm ionic radius U4+ to oxidize to the smaller 84-pm ionic radius U5+; ionic radii are from Shannon et al. [41]. PNNL's results closely follow Vegard's law [42], within experimental uncertainty, with linear regression of our data yielding A = 547.08 − 0.227 X where A is the lattice parameter of the UO2-Gd2O3 solid solution in pm, and X is the weight percent Gd2O3. These results are comparable to those of Wada et al. [43] who reported A = 547.04 − 0.237 X for sintered co-precipitated powders and consistent with Leinders et. al. [16] who reported a UO2 lattice parameter of 547.13 pm . The authors’ results confirm those of Kapoor et al. [44] and are consistent with those measured by Baena et al. [45].
<Section>3. Results and discussion</Section>
This section discusses the results of thermoanalytical air oxidation studies of nuclear fuel vendor- and PNNL-prepared UO2 and (Gd,U)O2 to determine the effect of increasing Gd content on increasing the stability and chemical resistance of cubic UO2 to oxidation to orthorhombic U3O8.
3.1. Air oxidation of UO2 and Gd-doped UO2
This section presents the results of thermoanalytical studies on the air oxidation of pure sintered UO2 and sintered Gd-doped UO2. Gas reactions with solids can follow a number of reaction mechanisms [33]. In their review article McEachern and Taylor [10] reported that the recognized pathway for oxidation of cubic UO2 to orthorhombic U3O8 (O:U = 2.67) is a two-step process with the first step being the formation of either a cubic U4O9+y (O:U=2.25 to 2.4) or tetragonal U3O7 (O:U=2.33) intermediate product with the latter being favored for pure UO2 and the former favored as the dopant concentration increases in doped UO2. Rousseau et al. [46] summarize previous studies finding many intermediates including different crystal structures of U4O9 and U3O7, and γ-U2O5. Leinders et. al. [17] provide a detailed description of the crystal structure changes, oxygen incorporation behavior, formation of oxygen vacancies in regular oxygen sites, and the effects on the anion sublattice that occur during oxidation to U4O9-y and to U3O8.
More recent studies by Rousseau et al. [46] and Desgranges [47] describe the full oxidation to U3O8 at 250°C as proceeding via four kinetic domains. Their phase transition sequence is UO2 to U4O9 to β-U3O7 to U3O8. Kim et. al. [7] reported U4O9 as the sole intermediate product and later Ha et. al. [15] revised their analysis to include U3O7 in the intermediate product mix.
For the two recognized reaction pathways for the air oxidation of UO2, all the oxidation steps are exothermic as shown in Table 1; enthalpies used for calculations were from Barin [48] and Wagman et al. [49]. Based on enthalpy changes U3O7 is favored over U4O9 as the product of the first oxidation.
Table 1. Calculated ΔHrx for air oxidation of UO2 to known products at 298.15 K (25°C). References indicate data used for calculations.
In this article the authors present mass data either in terms of the O/M molar ratio where M is the molar sum of U and Gd, or in terms of the molar OU/U ratio where OU is the oxygen associated with the U assuming that the Gd3+ was inert to further oxidation. Differences in the reaction pathway should present in the TG/DTA and DSC-measured onset temperatures and DSC-measured reaction enthalpies; it should be noted that accurately measuring enthalpy changes is challenging because of unobserved heat loss to the sweep gas.
3.1.1. Air oxidation of sintered pure UO2
The air or oxygen oxidation of UO2 is a variable multistep sequential process depending on temperature and oxygen pressure. As described by Keller [50], the oxidation of UO2 by oxygen or air to U3O8 can proceed via the sequential formation of many different intermediate oxides including the cubic fluorite phase UO2+x. In UO2+x the excess O distributes itself randomly at the edge centers of the cubic fluorite lattice.
McEachern and Taylor [10] report that air oxidation of UO2 below 400°C are controlled by many factors including temperature, moisture content of the oxidizing gas, dopant and impurity content, oxygen partial pressure, particle size, grain size, and pellet density. To refine the experimental approach focusing on the effects of dopants, we investigated the effects of particle size (as mentioned before) and sintering in dry or humidified 4% H2 on UO2 oxidation and found it necessary to reduce particle size to < 44 µm and unnecessary to moisten the sintering gas nor that grain size differences affected oxidation with the size of PNNL materials.
Consistent with McEachern and Taylor [10], Kim et al. [7], Ha et al. [15], Ollila and Lindqvist [9], and Furuichi et al. [51], the 2°C/min-DSC and -TG analyses presented in Fig. 1 observed two major exothermic steps as air oxidized UO2 to U3O8. The onset temperatures for the two reaction steps were in the range of those reported by others with the first reaction beginning between 120°C and 140°C and the second oxidation beginning at 305°C or before the first reaction completed. Extrapolating the first reaction's DSC and DTG peaks to completion provides a final OU/U between 2.25 and 2.33 or indeterminate whether U4O9 or U3O7 is the initial product. Furuichi et al. [51] and Ollia and Lindqvist [9] reported a final stable O/U of 2.3 or U3O7 for the first oxidation product while Leinders et. al. [17] observed final stable O/U's of up to 2.4 depending on material surface area and temperature. Kim et al. [7] and Ha et al. [23] resolved after their second gadolinium study to report the product as U4O9/U3O7. All reported the second reaction's product at the expected O/U 2.67.
Fig. 1. Air-oxidation of PNNL sintered pure UO2 as measured by DSC and TG at 2°C/min.
Different heating rates DSC analyses provided in Fig. 2 shows that the oxidation of UO2 to U4O9/U3O7 was a singular step while the oxidation of U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 proceeds through multiple intermediate uranium oxides. The single shoulder on the U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 peak observed by the 0.15°C/min analysis sequentially splits as the heating rate is increased up to 40°C/min into three. Thus, the air oxidation of sintered UO2 to U3O8 proceeds at least through four distinct steps consistent with Furuichi et al. [51] who also observed multiple peaks using DSC and TG at 5°C/min.

As Table 2 provides, subsequent XRD analysis of sintered UO2 powder heated at 40°C/min to selected temperatures and quenched to room temperature, showed the formation of at least one intermediate oxide, U13O34 (UO2.62), as U4O9/U3O7 is oxidized to U3O8. Keller [50] reported that the air- or oxygen-oxidation of UO2 proceeds through several intermediate oxides to U3O8 including several lesser studied intermediate oxides. These analyses indicate that each oxidation step does not complete before the next step begins. The identities of the various oxides and their concentrations formed during oxidation would be elucidated better using an XRD with a heated sample stage. Leinders et. al. [17] speculated that the oxidation occurring on the surfaces of grains often formed potentially amorphous UO3 leading to the potential that grain size and dispersion could contribute to the distribution of oxides reported in Table 2.

3.1.2. Effect of gadolinium content on oxidation
This section presents the results of our thermoanalytical studies on Gd's effect on air oxidation of UO2 in (Gd,U)O2. The effects of dopants or impurities have been studied by many [6,7,9,11,12,14,15,[52], [53], [54]]. McEachern and Taylor [10] report that at low temperature, the oxidation of unirradiated fuel, or UO2 doped with low concentrations of impurities, results in U3O7; however, McEachern et al. [6] report that as dopant or fission product content increases, U4O9+y (UO2.25+y) is favored and thus use U3O7/U4O9 to identify the intermediate oxidation product. Kim et. al. [7] reported U4O9 as the sole intermediate product and subsequent studies found a mix of U4O9 and in the intermediate product [15] and so resolved to report U product as U4O9/U3O7. In contrast, Thomas et al. [55] found that oxidation of spent light water reactor fuel or highly doped UO2 formed the cubic product UO2.4.
As shown in Fig. 3, at an isothermal 325°C, increasing Gd content slowed both oxidation steps and reduced the amount of U3O8 produced independent of preparer. Increasing Gd content reduced the final U-oxidation state from an OU/U molar ratio of 2.7 for pure UO2 and 1% Gd2O3/UO2 to 2.4 for 10% Gd2O3/UO2. Leinders et. al. [17] observed similar isothermal reaction profiles for UO2.

The XRD analyses of products provided in Table 3 showed stabilization of the cubic form U3O7/U4O9 with it being the only form in the oxidized 10% Gd. Talip et. al. [14] attributes the slowing of the first oxidation in Gd-doped UO2 to U3O7/U4O9 to the lattice contraction caused by Gd3+ addition and subsequent reduction of oxygen mobility. Hanson's studies [56] on spent fuel thermal stability studies showed increased stability of the U3O7/U4O9. In contrast, the U in the nuclear fuel vendor-prepared doped UO2 oxidized to a higher oxidation state with the 3%, 5%, and 6% gadolinia oxidizing to an OU/U ratio of > 2.7; their 6% gadolinia required 7600 min to reach an OU/U ratio of 2.77. Keller's [50] phase diagram for the uranium-oxygen system shows that O/U ratios up to 2.9 are stable at 325°C.

The a and b lattice parameters for the orthogonal phase varied with deviations of 5 pm and 2 pm, respectively. The c parameter was constant.
The duplication of the thermal behaviors the duplicate 5% Gd oxidations presented in Fig. 3 illustrate the reproducibility of the TG analyses. Both analyses had the same thermal sensitivities and same final 2.72 OU/U. The measured nearly equivalent thermal sensitivities of pure UO2 and 1% Gd provide similar confidence.
Comparison of the effects of Gd doping levels on the thermal oxidation of UO2 as measured by TG are provided in Fig. 4, Fig. 5A and by DSC in Fig. 5B; the TG and DSC analyses were independent. Comparison of the DTG and DSC results illustrate 1) consistency of thermal behaviors for same materials, 2) consistency of the 1st oxidation's onset temperature, 3) increasing Gd content slowed the 1st oxidation's rate, and 4) increasing Gd content delayed the 2nd oxidation's onset and peak temperature maxima (see Table 4). The latter observation is particularly manifest for the 10% Gd which when compared to its thermal behavior at an isothermal 325°C (Fig. 3) shows that the U in 10% Gd will oxidize to U3O8 once sufficient temperature is provided to overcome the 10% Gd's 2nd oxidation activation energy. The slowing of the 1st oxidation's rate is consistent with this reaction being diffusion controlled [57] given the crystal contraction occurring with increased Gd doping. Small shoulders or inflections observed by the DSC also hint that the oxidation to U3O8 is a multistep reaction with at least three distinct steps or stable intermediates. These analyses indicate that addition of Gd increases the stability of both the UO2 and the U3O7/U4O9 consistent with Kim et al.’s [7] 1°C/min to 540°C TG studies.

3.1.3. Effect of Gd content on air oxidation kinetics of UO2
McEachern and Taylor [10] describe the first oxidation of UO2 to U4O9/U3O7 as diffusion-controlled displaying parabolic reaction kinetics. They describe the second reaction step producing U3O8 as following the nucleation and growth mechanism displaying sigmoidal reaction kinetics. Often this second reaction proceeds concurrently with the U4O9/U3O7 formation by diffusion of oxygen into the lattice.
Although the authors’ primary focus was to assess whether added Gd imparted a greater resistance to air oxidation, we took advantage of acquired thermal reaction behavior to do an analysis of the kinetic mechanism(s) controlling air oxidation of UO2 modified with Gd. To identify the fundamental gas/solid reaction mechanism(s) controlling each step of the oxidation of UO2 and (U,Gd)O2, the authors used the model-fitting approach [40] by comparing the Szekely et al. [33] mechanism models to our 325°C isothermal TG-measured oxidation behaviors. We compared their models for first and second order chemical reactions, 1- and 3-dimensional diffusion-controlled reactions (1D- and 3D-Diffusion), 2- and 3-dimensional phase boundary mechanisms (2D- and 3D Phase Boundary), and 2- and 3-dimensional nucleation and growth mechanisms (2D- and 3D-Nucleation & Growth).
We began our kinetic model comparisons as two independent successive steps. The analysis of the first oxidation reaction began after the temperature reached 324°C and the temperature increase rate initially at 325°C/min slowed to 0.2°C/min. The heat up to 325°C required 6 to 10 min, nominally caused an OU/U increase of 0.12 unit, and did not exceed 325°C.
It should be noted that the TG-measured results presented in the kinetic analysis figures that follow are direct data plots. We suspect that their stair-step appearance arises from an insufficient mass change for the instrument to recognize a mass change.
The factors Patisson and Ablitzer [34] identify that control the rate of the reaction between gas and a solid include 1) the unrestrained chemical reaction rate equation (e.g., first or second order), 2) transport of the reactive gas to the solid's surface within the gas, 3) transport into the interior of the solid via diffusion through the continuously evolving initial dense or porous reaction product or via intergranular cracks or pores, and 4) whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic coupled with the thermal conductivity of the parent and product. The physical nature of the solid such as particle size and shape will affect how these factors manifest themselves in the observed time-based reaction profile.
The reported fundamental sequential two-step oxidation of UO2 to U3O8 and the authors’ observation of more than two steps further complicated development of a complete kinetic gas/solid reaction model. The thermal sensitivity of the oxidation of the first product will determine if the reported second oxidation step proceeds before or after the first product is completely formed.
3.1.3.1. Neat UO2
Fig. 6A compares the kinetic models for the 325°C air-oxidation of U in UO2 to U4O9/U3O7. This comparison indicates that the initial reaction for the first 20 min was best fit by the First Order Reaction or 3D- or 2D-Phase Boundary models. This first oxidation to U4O9/U3O7 proceeds by the insertion of oxygen into the oxide crystal structure without significantly distorting the crystal. If the first oxidation is a chemical reaction mechanism, oxygen is free to react and insert itself into the oxide's crystal structure. If the first oxidation mechanism is the phase boundary mechanism, the oxygen must pass or be passed through the surface product layer (but not controlled by diffusion) to react with the UO2. After the first 20 min, the measured does not adhere to a single mechanistic model rather transitioning to a combination of 2D- or 3D-Phase Boundary and 2D-Nucleation & Growth (see Pijolat and Favergeon [36] for a description of 2D-Nucleation & Growth). These results are not consistent with McEachern and Taylor [10] who postulated that oxygen diffusion into the matrix controls the kinetics of U oxidation to U4O9/U3O7.
Fig. 6. Comparison of TG-measured air oxidation of U in UO2 at 325°C A) to U4O9/U3O7 and B) U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 with candidate kinetic models.
One potential explanation for the TG results lying between two different mechanisms is that the second oxidation step could be occurring simultaneously with the first step. This may explain many of the transitions reported for other materials.
As shown in Fig. 6B, the oxidation of U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 begins following the 2D-Nucleation & Growth mechanism and transitions to the 2D-Phase Boundary mechanism and later to 3D-Phase Boundary. After the first 20 minutes this oxidation to U3O8 transitions to a mechanism that appears to be a combination of the 2D-Nucleation & Growth and 2D-Phase Boundary mechanisms with the latter becoming dominant with time; 3D-Phase Boundary appears to become dominant in the very later stages. The early dominance of the Nucleation and Growth mechanism in the early oxidation is consistent with McEachern and Taylor's [10] evaluation that Nucleation and Growth was the sole mechanism, however, the transition to Phase Boundary indicates that a boundary layer forms which inhibits the oxidation.
This kinetic analysis indicated that the oxidation of neat UO2 to U3O8 proceeds via a variety of mechanisms often in combination in both steps at 325°C. Whether this variety of behaviors and difference from past postulated mechanisms at temperatures ranging from sub-ambient to <400°C [10] is due to mechanistic changes with temperature or the physical characteristics cannot be concluded from this study. Oxidation to U4O9/U3O7 completed in 80 min and the subsequent oxidation to U3O8 required an additional 270 min.
3.1.3.2. Gd2O3/UO2
The oxidation of 1% Gd/UO2 proceeded via the same mechanistic pathways as net UO2. Fig. 7A shows that the oxidation of U to U4O9/U3O7 began as 2D-Phase Boundary, combined and eventually transitioned to 2D-Nucleation & Growth. Fig. 7B shows that the oxidation of U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 first proceeded via 2D-Nucleation & Growth and later combined and transitioned to Phase Boundary. This first step required 85 min and the second 265 min. Modifying UO2 with 1% Gd did not significantly alter the oxidative behavior or reaction times relative to UO2.
Fig. 7. Comparison of TG-measured air oxidation of the U in 1% Gd/UO2 to (A) U4O9/U3O7 and (B) U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 with candidate kinetic models with 325°C.
3.1.3.3. 3% Gd2O3/UO2
Modifying the UO2 matrix to 3% Gd slowed the reaction times and changed the mechanisms required for each step relative to both UO2 and 1% Gd/UO2. The incorporation of 3% Gd dramatically changes the oxidation mechanism of UO2 to U4O9/U3O7 as shown in Fig. 8A to 1D-Diffusion and gradually combines and transitions to First Order or Phase Boundary. This first step required about 130 min or more time than measured for the (1% Gd,U)O2.
Fig. 8. Comparison of TG-measured air oxidation of the U in 3% Gd/UO2 to (A) U4O9/U3O7 and (B) from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 at 325°C with candidate kinetic models.
The oxidation of the U in 3% Gd/UO2 from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8, presented in Fig. 8B, initially follows the 2D- and 3D-Phase Boundary models rather than Nucleation and Growth and later combined and transitioned to First Order. The additional time required for the second step was significantly longer than neat UO2 and 1% Gd/UO2 requiring 570 min.
3.1.3.4. 5% Gd2O3/UO2
Increasing the gadolinia content to 5% further slowed reaction rates and changed the oxidation behavior for the two steps. As shown in Fig. 9A, the oxidation of U4+/U5+ to U4O9/U3O7 clearly followed 1D-Diffusion for the entire oxidation and required 165 min. Further oxidation from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 as shown in Fig. 9B continued via 1D-Diffusion and later combined and transitioned to a first order reaction. The second step oxidation of 5% Gd/UO2 required an additional 735 min relative to 3% Gd.
Fig. 9. Comparison of TG-measured air oxidation of the U in 5% Gd/UO2 to (A) U4O9/U3O7 and (B) from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 at 325°C with candidate kinetic models.
3.1.3.5. 8% Gd2O3/UO2
In contrast to the lower additions of Gd, modifying UO2 with 8% Gd accelerated the reaction rate for the first oxidation to U4O9/U3O7 while not changing in the gas/solid oxidation mechanism observed for 5% Gd. In contrast, the subsequent oxidation to U3O8 slowed and changed mechanism. As shown in Fig. 10A, the oxidation of U to U4O9/U3O7 proceeds via 1D-Diffusion for the entire oxidation and required 90 min, or less than required for 5% Gd. As shown in Fig. 9B, the oxidation of U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 proceeded via a First Order model and required 910 min or longer than 5% Gd.

3.1.3.6. 10% Gd2O3/UO2
Modifying UO2 to 10% Gd accelerated the reaction rate relative to UO2 and other Gd-doped UO2 material with the first oxidation to U4O9/U3O7 proceeding via diffusion-controlled mechanism(s) similar to the 8% Gd. While the 8% Gd proceeded via 1D-Diffusion, as shown in Fig. 11A, the 10% Gd appears to begin as 1D-Diffusion and quickly transitioned to 3D-Diffusion. This first step required 70 min to complete and less than the 90 min required for the 8% Gd. In contrast, Fig. 11B shows that the subsequent oxidation to U3O8 proceeds via the Second Order Reaction mechanism and later combined and transitioned to 3D-Diffusion. The oxidation from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 required 1030 min.
Fig. 11. Comparison of TGA-measured air oxidation of the U in 10% Gd/UO2 to (A) U4O9/U3O7 and (B) from U4O9/U3O7 to U3O8 at 325°C with candidate kinetic models.
Table 5. summarizes our kinetic model analysis and shows that increasing Gd content alters the observed gas/solid mechanism and reaction times required for each of the UO2 oxidation steps. The observed mechanisms include all the possible mechanism types depending on the Gd content. In most cases each step began with one type and transitioned to another. For the first step, the mechanism often transitioned to that observed for the beginning of the second step suggesting overlap of the two steps; the TG does not show a strong demarcation between the two steps at 325°C.
Table 5. Air oxidation of UO2 and (Gd,U)O2 2-step kinetic mechanisms and times.
With respect to reaction times, for the first step where UO2 is oxidized to U4O9/U3O7, the times increased up to 5% Gd and then decreased for the 8% and 10% Gd-doped UO2. The second step's time increased with each incremental addition of Gd. This indicates that Gd stabilizes U4O9/U3O7 and would thus increase resistance to the conversion to the orthorhombic U3O8 with its significant increase in crystal size.
Although not rigorous kinetic study, the authors’ comparison of possible gas/solid kinetic models with isothermal 325°C TG air oxidation studies of UO2 indicates that air oxidation of UO2 is complex with the first oxidation to U4O9/U3O7 proceeding via at least two mechanisms rather than the traditional diffusion mechanism. The team's studies also found that the 2nd oxidation step to U3O8 also proceeds via at least 2 mechanisms including the generally recognized nucleation and growth mechanism. The introduction of Gd into the UO2 crystal significantly alters the oxidation mechanisms and the mechanism is significantly affected by the Gd-doping level. Thermal analysis coupled with XRD would help elucidate and refine the understanding of the complex set of gas/solid kinetic mechanism(s) that govern reaction of UO2 and doped UO2 with air.
<Section>4. Summary/conclusions of thermal sensitivity studies of UO2 and Gd-doped UO2</Section>
We investigated the effects of Gd doping on the thermal stability of UO2 based on onset temperatures and reaction times to completion. In addition, we investigated the reaction mechanisms for the two distinct oxidation steps by comparing to kinetic gas/solid kinetic models. These studies showed that adding Gd to UO2 stabilized the cubic oxide and prevented or slowed U oxidation to the orthorhombic U3O8. These studies also show that the oxidation from UO2 to U3O8 proceeds via a complex sequence of oxidation steps passing through more than one additional stable uranium oxide and that introducing a trivalent Gd with its resultant crystal compaction causes the oxidation of U to proceed via a variety of kinetic gas/solid mechanisms depending on Gd content.
The limited study of pure UO2 oxidation extends the generally accepted pure UO2 two-step air oxidation with the first and second steps proceeding via Diffusion and Nucleation & Growth, respectively. DSC studies, using heating rates from 0.15 to 40°C, showed formation of at least one additional uranium oxide U13O34, identified by XRD, as U3O7/U4O9 oxidizes to U3O8. Comparison of isothermal 325°C TG analyses with postulated gas/solid kinetic mechanism models found that the oxidation of UO2 to U3O7/U4O9 proceeded initially via 1st Order Chemical or Phase Boundary mechanisms, transitioned to Nucleation & Growth which continued in the early stages of U3O7/U4O9 oxidation to U3O8, and finally transitioned to Phase Boundary.
The team's isothermal and non-isothermal thermoanalytical studies on doping UO2 with Gd indicate that, as hoped, increasing Gd content enhances the stability of the initial U3O7/U4O9 cubic oxidation product(s) and delays the subsequent oxidation to U3O8. Gd doping does not significantly affect the initial oxidation onset but increasing Gd content incrementally slows the UO2 to U3O7/U4O9 oxidation. The slowing of the initial oxidation delays the onset of the oxidation from U3O7/U4O9 to U3O8 but does not appear to have a significant effect on the reaction rate for completing this reaction nor the final OU/U. For example, a concentration of 10 wt% Gd2O3 had the most significant impact on the stability of U3O7/U4O9 with its delaying the 2nd oxidation step's onset to 460°C compared to UO2’s onset of 320°C as measured by TG and DSC at 2°C/min.
The studies on the effect of increasing Gd content on the oxidation mechanisms for U oxidation to an OU/U of 2.67 showed that Gd concentration significantly affected the kinetic pathway(s) for the two steps. The 1st oxidation step proceeded via different kinetic mechanisms depending on Gd concentration of Phase Boundary, Nucleation & Growth, 1st Order Chemical, and Diffusion. The 2nd oxidation step proceeded at various Gd concentrations via Nucleation and Growth, Phase Boundary, 1st and 2nd Order Chemical, and Diffusion.
