<Section>Abstract</Section>
A comprehensive review and validation of three approaches to predict interfacial area concentration in subcooled boiling flow are presented. The three methods are geometry-based semi-empirical correlations, empirical correlations, and the interfacial area transport equation (IATE). Extensive boiling experiment databases with the measurement of local interfacial area concentration and other local two-phase parameters are employed in the validation. The benchmark shows that the most suitable semi-empirical or empirical correlations chosen to predict the interfacial area concentration are different in the low void fraction region and high void fraction region. The closure model sensitivity in the IATE evaluation is analyzed for the bubble layer thickness models, point of net vapor generation (PNVG) determination approaches, and the presence of large cap and slug bubbles. The analysis of the bubble layer thickness model in IATE reveals that the model is necessary for subcooled boiling systems and the flat bubble layer thickness model is more appropriate than the triangle bubble layer thickness model. The result suggests a necessity of measuring the Point of Net Vapor Generation (PNVG) information in experiments for IATE calculation and the necessity of improvement to the PNVG models. The benchmark shows that the one-group IATE has exceptional performance in low group-2 void fraction region; while in high void fraction flows, the multi-group approach is needed to account for the different characteristics between small and large bubbles.

<Section>1. Introduction</Section>
Subcooled boiling flow is of vital importance in engineering applications, such as nuclear reactors, boilers, refrigeration systems, and heat exchangers. In nuclear reactors, subcooled boiling flow is found in the core of light water reactors during normal operation and on the low-pressure side of the steam generator tubes. In subcooled boiling, nucleated bubbles can exist in the flow before the bulk fluid reaches saturation temperature, due to the thermodynamic non-equilibrium across the flow channel (Tong and Tang, 1997). Subcooled boiling is one of the key phenomena to model in the nuclear safety system codes and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. The ability to understand the mechanisms and behavior and to predict the flow properties in the complex subcooled boiling flow region is essential.
The two-fluid model (Ishii and Hibiki, 2011) is now widely used in order to accurately simulate two-phase flow. It is formulated by separately considering the vapor phase and liquid phase with two sets of conservation equations governing the mass, momentum, and energy balance in each phase. The conservation equations for the two phases are coupled by the interfacial transfer terms, namely the mass transfer rate, Γk, the momentum transfer rate, Mk, and the energy transfer rate, Ek, from the interfaces to the kth-phase. In general, the transfer terms are defined as the product between the interfacial area concentration, ai, and the flux that drives the transfers of mass, momentum, and energy across the interface.
Given the importance of the interfacial transfer terms, the performance of the two-fluid model thus lies in part on the accuracy of the modeling of the interfacial area concentration. In general, the modeling of the interfacial area concentrations can be divided into geometry-based semi-empirical correlations, empirical correlations, and the Interfacial Area Transport Equation (IATE) (Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 1995). The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive benchmark for the three approaches with currently available boiling databases. Furthermore, the closure model sensitivity in the IATE evaluation is analyzed for the bubble layer thickness models, point of net vapor generation (PNVG), and the presence of large cap and slug bubbles.
<Section>2. Review of existing work</Section>
2.1. Modeling
2.1.1. Geometry-based semi-empirical correlation
Ishii and Mishima (1980) proposed the fundamental geometry relation between void fraction and interfacial area concentration for spherical bubbles in the bubbly flow regime as,
(1)⟨ai⟩=6⟨α⟩⟨Dsm,b⟩=6⟨α⟩⟨Db⟩[⟨Db⟩⟨Dsm,b⟩],
where <Dsm,b> and <Db> are the Sauter mean diameter of small spherical bubbles and the bubble particle diameter. The term <Db>/<Dsm,b> in Eq. (1) is the shape factor (Ozar et al., 2008). And based on simple geometric considerations, they extended the correlation to slug flow regime and provided the following relation,
(2)⟨ai⟩≃4.5CctDh⟨α⟩−⟨αgs⟩1−⟨αgs⟩+6⟨α⟩⟨Dsm,b⟩1−⟨α⟩1−⟨αgs⟩,
where Cct, Dh, and <αgs> are the roughness factor accounting the wavy surface of a slug bubble, the hydraulic diameter, and void fraction of small bubbles in the liquid slug and film. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is the contribution from large slug bubbles, and the second term is the contribution from small spherical bubbles.
The correlations are widely used by thermal-hydraulic system codes like RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and TRACE (TRACE, 2010). When using Eq. (1), a priori knowledge of <Dsm,b> or <Db> is required to formulate the two equations above. TRACE (TRACE, 2010) and RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) employ closure correlations for different diameters of small bubbles, where the former uses the Laplace length for the Sauter mean diameter, <Dsm,b>, and the latter defines the average bubble diameter, <Db>, with the critical Weber number. RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) also defines the shape factor, <Db>/<Dsm,b>, as 3.6/6 to consider the non-spherical bubbles when using Eq. (1) in bubbly flow. When using Eq. (2) in slug flow, RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and TRACE (TRACE, 2010) set the roughness factor, Cct, as 2 and 1, respectively. They also employ different methods to determine <αgs>: TRACE (TRACE, 2010) uses a constant value related to the flow regime transition criteria (Ozar et al., 2008), while RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) employs the void fraction limit from bubbly to slug, <αbs>, and the void fraction limit from slug to annular flow transition, <αsa>.
The correlations of RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and TRACE (TRACE, 2010) are summarized in Table 1. As the correlations indicate, they are dependent on the flow regime, and numerical instabilities can occur at the transitions between the flow regimes. Hence, an approach that can dynamically model the interfacial area concentration without reliance on flow regime is needed.
Table 1. Summary of geometry-based semi-empirical correlations.
Slug Flow: ⟨ai⟩=4.5Dh⟨α⟩−⟨αgs⟩1−⟨αgs⟩+6⟨αgs⟩⟨Dsm,b⟩1−⟨α⟩1−⟨αgs⟩, and <αgs> is assigned to be 0.25 in the current paper.
2.1.2. Empirical correlations
Many researchers (Zeitoun et al., 1994; Hibiki and Ishii, 2002a) developed empirical interfacial area concentration correlations, but only a few focused on phase-change water-vapor flow. Zeitoun et al. (1994) and Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) developed empirical correlations based on the databases obtained from their experiments. The experiment of Zeitoun et al. (1994) was conducted in the condensing region of a vertical annulus channel with the subcooled steam-water flow; Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) experiment was conducted in the subcooled boiling region of the same facility. The conditions of both experiments were low pressure, low flow rate, with a maximum void fraction under 0.45. On the other hand, Hibiki et al. (2006) developed the interfacial area concentration correlation based on the bubble number density transport equation. The correlation was first developed in adiabatic bubbly flow and then extended into boiling bubbly flow systems. The parameters for the correlation are based on the vertical-upward internally heated annulus experiment Situ et al. (2004), the detail of which is described in the following section. The correlation was validated with an extensive database comprising of 343 boiling flow data that cover various channel geometry, flow directions, and flow conditions. Hibiki et al. (2006) correlation is developed in bubbly flow and validated only with the subcooled boiling conditions where the void fraction is less than 10%, thus it should not be used beyond bubbly flow. The correlations of Zeitoun et al. (1994), Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996), and Hibiki et al. (2006) are summarized in Table 2. These three correlations suggest that the interfacial area concentration is dependent on void fraction and internal length scale (Laplace length). Additionally, Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) and Hibiki et al. (2006) correlations suggest the dependence of interfacial area concentration on system length scale (flow channel hydraulic diameter).

2.1.3. Interfacial area transport equation in boiling flow
Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii (1995) developed the one-group IATE to dynamically model the interfacial area concentration, based on the fluid particle number density transport equations analogous to Boltzmann's transport equation. The one-group IATE disregards the type of bubbles and treats them equally as spherical bubbles. Hibiki et al. (2003a) provided the formulation of one-group IATE for subcooled boiling flow with the bubble layer thickness model. Brooks and Hibiki (2016) proposed a complete framework of the one-dimensional one-group IATE model for phase change flow. The one-dimensional one-group IATE in subcooled boiling considering the bubble layer thickness model introduced by Hibiki et al. (2003a) can be written as (Ishii and Hibiki, 2011),
(3)∂∂z(⟨ai⟩B⟨⟨vg,z⟩⟩)=⟨φExp⟩B+⟨φRC⟩B+⟨φTI⟩B+⟨φcon,ic⟩B+φWN,
where vg,z, <φExp>B, <φRC>B, <φTI>B, <φcon,ic>B, and φWN are the axial gas velocity, the expansion term, the random collision sink term, the turbulent impact source term, the inertially controlled condensation term, and the wall nucleation term, respectively. The modeling and closure for the IATE in subcooled boiling flow are shown in Table 3. Although the bubble interaction mechanisms, i.e. the random collision sink term and the turbulent impact source term, are originally proposed for air-water bubbly flow, the applicability of the interaction mechanisms is justified by the mechanistic modeling approach (Brooks and Hibiki, 2016). In addition, bubble interaction terms have been shown to have a negligible impact on interfacial area concentration in the subcooled boiling flow (Brooks and Hibiki, 2016).
Table 3. Source and sink terms of one-group IATE.
Park et al. (2007) proposed the condensation model with two different condensation regimes, which are the heat transfer controlled condensation and the inertially controlled condensation. In the inertially controlled condensation model by Park et al. (2007), the bubble collapse time is,
(4)⟨tCon⟩B=⟨Dsm⟩2(1−βbc2)4ρghfg⟨NuCon⟩kf⟨ΔTsub⟩B,
where βbc is the critical non-dimensional diameter, with a value of 0.4 (Kumar and Brooks, 2017). Zeitoun's correlation (Zeitoun, 1994) is used to calculate the Nusselt number as,
(5)⟨NuCon⟩=2.04⋅⟨Reb⟩0.61⋅α0.328⋅⟨Ja⟩−0.308,
where,
(6)⟨Reb⟩=ρf⟨Ub⟩⟨Dsm⟩μf,
(7)⟨Ub⟩=1.531−⟨α⟩(Δρgσρf2)1/4,⟨Ja⟩=ρfcp,f(⟨Tsat⟩−⟨Tf⟩)ρghfg,
where Reb>, <Ub>, <Ja>, and <Dsm> are the bubble Reynolds number, bubble rise velocity, Jacob number, and the Sauter mean diameter, respectively.
Brooks and Hibiki (2016) found that the inertially controlled condensation sink term by Park et al. (2007) overpredicted the condensation rate and Brooks and Hibiki (2016) developed the bubble layer average subcooling temperature to compensate for the overprediction. The bubble layer average subcooling temperature, TBL, is given as,
(8)TBL=1RI+0.5xB((RI+0.5xB)Tsat−(0.5RI+13xB)(Tsat−⟨Tf⟩)),
where xB, RI, and Tsat are the bubble layer thickness, heated rod diameter, and saturated temperature. Therefore, the condensation subcooled temperature can be calculated with the equation ⟨ΔTsub⟩B=Tsat−TBL. This bubble layer subcooling temperature assumption is crude, however it was required for the available condensation modeling.
Later, Kumar and Brooks (2017) showed that the condensation sink term, specifically the condensation Nusselt number, overestimated the change in interfacial area concentration. Kumar and Brooks (2017) then proposed a modified Nusselt number correlation to Park et al. (2007) condensation model and showed a good prediction of the interfacial area concentration with condensation databases. The boundary diameter between the heat transfer controlled condensation regime and the inertially controlled condensation regime, <Dbc>, is used to replace the Sauter mean diameter, <Dsm>, in Eq. (6) where <Dbc> is calculated as,
(9)⟨Dbc⟩=βbc⟨Dsm⟩.
Therefore, the bubble Reynolds number is modified as,
(10)⟨Reb⟩=ρf⟨Ub⟩⟨Dbc⟩μf.
In the current paper, the condensation subcooled temperature, <ΔTsub>B, in Eq. (4) is modified as,
(11)⟨ΔTsub⟩B=Tsat−⟨Tf⟩,
where the area-averaged liquid temperature, <Tf>, replaces the crude bubble layer average subcooling temperature in Brooks and Hibiki (2016) IATE model. In the current paper, the modified bubble Reynolds number and the modified condensation subcooled temperature, i.e. Eqs. (10), (11), are employed for the one-group IATE to calculate the interfacial area concentration.
2.1.4. Bubble layer thickness model
Hibiki et al. (2003a) developed the bubble layer thickness model to account for the non-uniform distribution of two-phase properties over a flow channel in subcooled boiling. The flow region is partitioned into two regions: boiling two-phase (bubble layer) region and liquid single-phase region. A void peaking is anticipated to appear near the heating surface in subcooled boiling flow. In the bubble layer region, the void fraction profile is assumed to be uniform, based on which the flat bubble layer thickness model is derived, or is assumed to be right-triangle peak near the heated wall, based on which the triangle bubble layer thickness model is derived. In the liquid single-phase region, the void fraction is assumed to be zero. Thus, the area-averaged void fraction is related to the bubble layer void fraction in an annulus channel as,
(12)⟨α⟩=ABAc⟨α⟩B,
where Ac, AB, and <α>B are the flow channel area, the bubble layer area, and the area-averaged void fraction in the bubble layer. The distribution parameter, C0, accounts for the effect of area averaging due to non-uniform radial void fraction distribution and volumetric flux distribution. The distribution parameter correlations of the flat bubble layer thickness model and the triangle bubble layer thickness model are derived by Hibiki et al. (2003a and 2003b). The bubble layer thickness can be determined by solving the distribution parameter correlations in Hibiki et al. (2003a and 2003b) with an empirical distribution parameter correlation. Many empirical distribution parameter correlations (Ishii, 1977; Chexal and Lellouche, 1986; Hibiki and Ishii, 2002b) have been developed for both adiabatic flow and boiling flow in various geometries. For the internally heated annulus databases in the current paper, the distribution parameter correlation is given by Ozar et al. (2008), as
(13)C0=(1.1−0.1ρgρf)(1−e−5.76⟨α⟩0.248)
2.1.5. PNVG model
An accurate location of the point of net vapor generation (PNVG) is the boundary condition for the onset of two-phase flow and the two-fluid model in a heated channel (Todreas and Kazimi, 2012). Two types of models are developed for the prediction of PNVG, which are analytical models and empirical models. The analytical models, such as the work of Levy (1967), Staub (1968), and Rogers et al. (1987), are derived from theoretical analyses of the thermal and hydrodynamic situations where a bubble detaches from the heating surface. The empirical models, such as the works by Bowring (1962), Saha and Zuber (1974), and Ünal (1975), are correlated from PNVG data. These empirical models include geometry dependence, fluid properties, and flow parameters. According to Dorra et al. (1993), the model by Saha and Zuber (1974) has the highest accuracy in predicting PNVG in subcooled boiling flow, while the model by Levy (1967) is the most accurate among the analytical models. Various names were given for the term PNVG by researchers: Saha and Zuber (1974) called it ‘the point of net vapor generation’, Levy (1967) called it ‘the point of bubble departure’, and some others used the names ‘the initial point of net vapor generation (IPNVG)’, ‘the onset of significant void (OSV)’, or ‘the net vapor generation point (NVGP)’ (Kureta et al., 2003). But as clarified by Kureta et al. (2003), both Levy (1967) and Saha and Zuber (1974) were referring to the point where bubbles start departing from the channel wall.
Saha and Zuber (1974) suggested two dimensionless parameters to predict the degree of liquid subcooling at PNVG, the Stanton number and the Nusselt number, based upon the argument that at low mass fluxes PNVG is controlled by local thermal conditions, whereas at high mass fluxes it is hydrodynamically controlled. The model by Levy (1967) is a mechanistic model for predicting the degree of liquid subcooling at PNVG in vertical, upward subcooled boiling flow. This model is derived from a force balance approach to establish a criterion for the onset of bubble departure. The balance has three parts, which are buoyancy and wall shear forces acting to detach the bubble, and the surface tension force acting in the opposite direction. The details of the correlations by Saha and Zuber (1974) model and Levy (1967) are summarized in Table 4.
Table 4. Correlations of PNVG prediction models.
2.2. Experimental data
To benchmark the models, the area-averaged interfacial area concentration data is necessary which is obtained from local interfacial area concentration. Many researchers have investigated subcooled boiling but only some of the datasets measured local two-phase-flow parameters, and even fewer measured local interfacial area concentration. A complete review of existing subcooled boiling experiments with local measurements of interfacial area concentration can be found in Bottini et al. (2020). The past data used in this work is summarized in Table 5 and described in this section.
Table 5. Summary of parameter range of the boiling databases conditions considered in the benchmark.
Two-point conductivity probes have been widely used to measure the interfacial area concentration (Situ et al., 2004; Yun et al., 1997; Bartel et al., 2001; Situ, 2004; Lee et al., 2009). In Yun et al. (1997), one two-point conductivity probe was installed 1.6 m downstream of the test channel inlet, which was moved between twelve radial locations across the flow channel with a traversing system. In Bartel et al. (2001), two-point conductivity probes were installed at four axial locations at eight radial locations, but the heater rod can be vertically traversed to provide eight axial locations to be studied with the four instrument ports. In Situ et al. (2004) (Situ, 2004), two-point conductivity probes were located at four axial positions at twelve radial locations to measure the local two-phase flow parameters for eleven cases.
Similar to the two-point conductivity probe technique, two-point optical-fiber probes have been used in boiling flows (Yun et al., 2008; Yun et al., 2010; Chu et al., 2017). Yun et al. (2008) used five two-point optical-fiber probes within the heated region and one in the downstream unheated region of their boiling facility. The probes were traversed in thirteen radial locations across the flow channel. Yun et al. (2010) employed the same facility with a slightly different heater rod to conduct another twelve experimental conditions. Yun et al. (2010) also installed five two-point optical-fiber probes in the heated region and one in the unheated region. Chu et al. (2017) conducted a subcooled boiling experiment with Freon R-134, where single-point and double-point optical-fiber probes were employed to measure the flow parameters at four axial locations with fourteen radial locations along the heated length.
Two-point conductivity probes and two-point optical-fiber probes have difficulty accurately measuring the interfacial area concentration when bubble's shape varies significantly from spherical. The application of four-sensor conductivity probes becomes important in these elevated-void-fraction conditions. Unlike two-point probes, four-point probes do not need spherical shape assumption to calculate the interfacial area concentration in the mathematical formulation (Kim et al., 2000). Four-point conductivity probes were used in three recent boiling flow datasets by Ozar et al. (2013), Ooi et al. (2019), and Bottini et al. (2020). The design and signal processing are critical in using the four-sensor probe where the curvature of small bubbles must be considered, as pointed out by Shen and Nakamura (2013 and 2014). Based on the design of Fu (2001) and Kim et al. (2000), the four-sensor probe design used in Ozar et al. (2013), Ooi et al. (2019), and Bottini et al. (2020) can be described equivalently to a build-in double-sensor probe with two additional trailing sensors. In this design, small bubbles are treated as spherical bubbles and delicately detected only by the lead sensor and a trailing sensor following the double sensor approach of Wu and Ishii (1999). The small bubbles' curvature is considered following a rigorous statistical analysis. Only the interfacial area concentration of large bubbles is calculated using all four sensors in Fu (2001) and Kim et al. (2000) approach.
In Ozar et al. (2013), four-point conductivity probes were used to measure the local parameter profiles for both spherical/distorted bubbles and cap/slug bubbles at ten radial locations and three axial positions in the heated section. In Ooi et al. (2019), three axial measurement ports were installed with four-point conductivity probes to measure the two-phase properties of multiple bubble groups along the 3-m-long heated section under natural circulation. To achieve a better resolution of phase properties, Bottini et al. (2020) used five measurement ports, where four-point conductivity probes are installed, within the 3-m heated section of the annulus channel. In addition, Bottini et al. (2020) employed a high-speed camera to record the flow structure at five viewports in between each of the instrumentation ports and identify the PNVG.
The data points for the benchmark in the following section are selected based on several criteria. Only conditions with consistent axial trends of interfacial area concentration and void fraction are selected. To obtain an accurate axial curve-fitting of two-phase parameters, cases with more than two non-zero measured values in the axial direction are required. All selected conditions have a void fraction larger than 0.005 at the first measurement location to avoid the large measurement uncertainty in interfacial area concentration from small sample sizes in the conductivity probe measurements. In addition, only the databases which provided the required measurement and boundary condition information can be used for model benchmarking. The parameters range of the conditions considered in the benchmark are summarized in Table 5. The data spans a large range of conditions and flow regimes, with void fractions up to 0.67.
<Section>3. Results and discussion</Section>
3.1. Correlations results
As noted in section 2.2, seven databases are used to validate the semi-empirical correlations and the empirical correlations, obtained from the works by Situ et al. (2004) (Situ, 2004), Lee et al. (2009), Yun et al. (2008), Yun et al. (2010), Ozar et al. (2013), Ooi et al. (2019), and Bottini et al. (2020). The mean average relative errors (MARE) of the geometry-based semi-empirical correlations and empirical correlations are provided in Table 6. The formula used to determine the MARE is,
(14)MARE(ai,cal,ai,exp)=1m∑k=1m|ai,calk−ai,expk|ai,expk.
where m is the number of data points; the subscripts cal and exp denote the calculated value and the experimental value.
Table 6. Summary of MARE of empirical correlations.
Fig. 1 shows the benchmark results of five different correlations discussed in section 2.1.1 Geometry-based semi-empirical correlation, 2.1.2 Empirical correlations with experimental void fraction in the range of [0.005,0.25]. TRACE (2010), and Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) correlations give good results with the majority of the data points predicted to roughly 40% of the experimental values. Conversely, the RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and Zeitoun et al. (1994) correlations show under-prediction, with the former being more severe, and Hibiki et al. (2006) correlation significantly over-predicts the experimental values. The results suggest that the TRACE (2010) correlation has a better assumption to the Sauter mean diameter of the small bubbles; while the RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) correlation needs to improve the assumed parameter values for either the critical Weber number or the shape factor. In addition, the averaged MARE of the Hibiki et al. (2006) correlation for the seven datasets is 53.5% when void fraction is less than 0.1 and few large bubbles exist; the MARE rises to 72.3% when the void fraction continues to increase to 0.25. As noted in section 2.1.2 that the Hibiki et al. (2006) correlation is only benchmarked with data less than 10% void fraction.
Fig. 1. Benchmark with experiment data points in the void fraction range of [0.005,0.25] of (a) semi-empirical correlations, (b) empirical correlations.
Fig. 2 shows the benchmark results in the void fraction range of [0.25,0.67]. RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and Zeitoun et al. (1994) correlations provide good predictions; TRACE (TRACE, 2010) correlation over-estimates the experimental values; while the results by Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) correlation are more scattered. In addition, the application of Hibiki et al. (2006) correlation is restricted to bubbly flow as stated in section 2.1.2, thus it is not employed in the void fraction range of [0.25,0.67]. The results show RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) has better consideration to big slug bubble's geometry and <αgs> than TRACE (TRACE, 2010); while the overprediction of ai by TRACE (TRACE, 2010) show that the determination of the spherical bubbles' fraction in the liquid slug, <αgs>, should be revisited for boiling flows. The result suggests the Zeitoun and Shoukri (1996) correlation needs more experimental data to improve the parameter values in the empirical correlation, as it is developed only based on their own dataset. Furthermore, the correlation of Zeitoun et al. (1994) predicts ai with fewer errors in the void fraction range of [0.25,0.67] than in [0.005,0.25], as it is developed with the data obtained in the condensing section of the flow channel where a larger fraction of large bubbles were observed.

3.2. IATE results
In this section, the one-group IATE for phase-change flow is benchmarked with seven boiling flow databases spanning a wide range of flow parameters listed in Table 5. Different than other flows, the IATE model in subcooled boiling flow is required to consider the bubble layer to account for the non-uniform distribution of two-phase properties, the PNVG location to determine the start point of the calculation, and the transition from small bubbles region to the large bubbles region. The sensitivity of the bubble layer thickness model, the PNVG determination approaches, and the presence of large cap/slug bubbles in one-group IATE are discussed in the following sections. In the base case, the flat bubble layer thickness model is used and the PNVG is determined by the expansion term. Detailed descriptions of the models are provided in the following sections. Table 7 is the summary of MARE of one-group IATE where the bold models are used by the base case. Sensitivity analysis is performed by changing the model of interest while keeping the other constitutive model as the bold model option in Table 7.
Table 7. Summary of MARE of 1-G IATE results (models, which are bold and italic, are used by the other sensitivity studies).
3.2.1. Effect of different bubble layer thickness models
Fig. 3 presents the axial comparison of the experiment and calculated interfacial area concentration, ai, for one condition from the database by Ozar et al. (2013), where the red dash line, green dash line and purple dash line are the results calculated by 1-G IATE with flat bubble layer thickness model, triangle bubble layer thickness model, and without bubble layer thickness model, respectively. The ai predicted by the one-group IATE with the triangle bubble layer thickness model and without the bubble layer thickness model are larger than the one with the flat bubble layer thickness model. The line with the triangle bubble layer thickness model is closer to the line without the bubble layer thickness model, which reflects that the bubble layer calculated by the triangle model is thicker than the bubble layer calculated by flat model and reaches the wall sooner. Fig. 4 is the benchmark of one-group IATE with different bubble layer thickness models, and Table 7 is the summary of MARE of one-group IATE with different bubble layer thickness models. When the bubble layer thickness model is switched from the flat model to the triangle model or no bubble layer thickness model is applied, the PNVG remains being determined by the expansion term and other constitutive models are the same as in the base case. With other models and parameters kept constant, the MAREs of the calculated results using the flat bubble layer thickness model, the triangle bubble layer thickness model, and no bubble later model are 81.9%, 97.6%, and 115.1%, respectively. Without the bubble layer thickness model, the one-group IATE shows the worst MARE. This suggests that bubble layer thickness model is necessary for one-group IATE in subcooled boiling flow to account for the non-uniform distribution of void fraction in the radial direction of the annulus flow channel. Also, the one-group IATE with triangle bubble layer thickness model is observed to overpredict the ai, which indicates that the flat bubble layer is more suitable for one-group IATE in subcooled boiling flow.

As the area-averaged temperature rises, more bubbles are generated in the bubble layer two-phase region. As a result, the bubble layer would spread across the flow channel from the inner heated wall to the outer unheated wall. Therefore, the calculation results can be categorized into three types: region I where the bubble layer has not reached the outer wall; region II where the bubble layer has already reached the outer wall, but there is still a subcooled region in the flow channel; and region III where the fluid in the whole channel is saturated or overheated. Table 7 also summarizes the MARE of one-group IATE in different sections. Agreement between the IATE calculation and experimental data found in the region I is substantially better than in regions II and III where large error values are encountered. This indicates that the one-group IATE is more capable to capture the mechanisms in the region I; while the one-group IATE model has limitations in regions II and III where the void fraction is higher and more large bubbles exist.
3.2.2. Effect of PNVG
PNVG information is required for IATE because it determines the starting point for the calculation of IATE. As discussed in section 2.1.5, Saha and Zuber (1974) and Levy (1967) developed models to predict the location where bubbles start departing from the channel wall, referred to here as PNVG. Bottini et al. (2020) employed high-speed visualization techniques to measure the PNVG locations based on the definition that bubbles start departing from the wall as well. In addition, PNVG can be given by the point when the expansion term, shown in Table 3, becomes greater than zero (Brooks and Hibiki, 2016). The last method is used for the previous calculations.
Fig. 5 presents an example of the axial comparison of the experiment and calculated interfacial area concentration for one condition in Bottini et al. (2020) database with PNVG determined with different approaches. The PNVG observed by Bottini et al. (2020) is located near the beginning of the heated section while the PNVG predicted by the models are located further downstream. For some conditions, the Saha-Zuber model (1974) predicts the PNVG after instrumentation port 1 where a significant amount of void has already been detected, as shown in Fig. 5; and for all cases Levy's model (Levy, 1967) predicts the PNVG at even higher elevations than the Saha and Zuber (1974) model. The lack of accuracy of the PNVG models highlights the necessity of improving the current models. On the other hand, the PNVG determined by expansion term is very close to the observed locations for most of the conditions which suggests that this approach could be used to determine the location of PNVG in experiments where observation is not possible.
Fig. 5. Comparison of simulated interfacial area concentration with experimental data of Run 7 in Bottini et al. (Bottini et al., 2020), Pin = 892.8 kPa, G = 1501.5 kg/m2/s, ΔTsub = 9.8 °C, qʺ = 285 kW/m.2.
Fig. 6 is the benchmark of one-group IATE using only Bottini et al.’s (Bottini et al., 2020) database with different PNVG information, and Table 7 summaries MARE of different PNVG determine methods for data in section I where one-group IATE gives promising results. As with the sensitivity analysis done in section 3.2.1, when PNVG method is varied the bubble layer thickness model is fixed as the flat profile model and other constitutive models remain the same. Using Levy (1967) model, the one-group IATE under-predicts the interfacial area concentration due to the higher elevation of the PNVG. On the other hand, a marginal improvement in accuracy is observed with the Saha-Zuber (Saha and Zuber, 1974) model. However, the use of this model should be cautioned because in these cases the modeled PNVG is at the downstream of instrumentation port-1 where the detected void fraction is significant. Furthermore, the prediction of the one-group IATE is the most accurate with measured PNVG. This suggests the need for more subcooled boiling experiments with measured PNVG information. Finally, the IATE with the PNVG determined by expansion term, which is the alternative approach for the datasets without measured PNVG information, provides a slightly less accurate result.

<Section>3.2.3. Effect of large bubbles</Section>
Fig. 7 shows the benchmark of one-group IATE corresponding to local subcooling and the total void fraction. Bulk subcooling is defined as the temperature difference between average centerline temperature and saturation temperature based on the measured pressure at the instrumentation port. The total void fraction is defined as the sum of the void fraction of group-1 bubbles and group-2 bubbles, a distinction only available by the works of Situ et al. (2004) (group separation information is in Situ (2004), Ozar et al. (2013), Ooi et al. (2019), and Bottini et al. (2020). The one-group IATE with the modified closure models gives a good result as most of the predicted interfacial area concentrations are within thirty percent of the experimental values. In Fig. 7(a), the predictions for the conditions with high local subcooling are generally more accurate than those with low local subcooling. The overprediction is caused by the one-group IATE's applicability to the flow where the bubble layer expands to the outer wall and the amount of large bubbles is high, which is determined by the combination of local subcooling with pressure and heat flux. In Fig. 7(b), for the data points from the databases by Bottini et al. (2020), Situ et al. (2004), and Lee et al. (2009) where the void fraction is greater than ~0.25, the one-group IATE overpredicts the experimental values. This reflects the limitation of the one-group IATE model, which given a void fraction, treats all bubbles equally with an average size across the entire range of existing bubbles. At high void fraction regions where small spherical bubbles and large slug bubbles exist simultaneously, the multi-group approach, which treats bubbles differently according to their sizes, is needed to avoid the overprediction of interfacial area concentration, as spherical bubbles have a larger surface-to-volume ratio than cap and slug bubbles. Additionally, the multi-group approach considers the difference in the mechanisms governing the sink/source of small and large bubbles by assigning different transport equations to each bubble group (Ishii and Hibiki, 2011). Therefore, at void fraction greater than 20% in boiling flow, the range of data considered in this benchmark suggests that the one-group IATE model should be used cautiously and may require a multi-group approach.

Fig. 8 presents the benchmark of one-group IATE with experimental data points where the group-2 void fraction is equal to or less than 0%, 5%, and 10%. Only 120 data points in the datasets from Situ et al. (2004), Ozar et al. (2013), Ooi et al. (2019), and Bottini et al. (2020) reported group-2 information and are employed in this comparison. Table 7 summaries the MARE of one-group IATE with all data and data where the group-2 void fraction is equal to or less than 0%, 5%, and 10%. Both Fig. 8 and Table 7 shows that one-group IATE provides excellent prediction when the group-2 void fraction is low. The MARE of one-group IATE calculation is 30.4%, 39.2%, and 39.5% where αg,2 = 0, αg,2≤5%, and αg,2≤10%, respectively; however, when more group-2 bubbles appear, the MARE of the total 143 points rises to 81.9%. It highlights the necessity of multi-group IATE for the conditions where a significant amount of cap/slug bubbles exist.

<Section>4. Conclusion</Section>
A comprehensive review and validation of three approaches to predict interfacial area concentration in subcooled boiling flow are presented with seven boiling experiment databases. The experimental data span a wide range of pressure (126–953 kPa), mass flux (208–2418 kg/m2/s), heat flux (51–471 kW/m2), inlet subcooling (3.8–30 °C), and void fraction (up to 67%). The three approaches are the geometry-based semi-empirical correlations, empirical correlations, and the Interfacial Area Transport Equation. The inertially controlled condensation term of the one-group IATE for subcooled boiling flow is modified based on the Kumar and Brooks (2017) condensation model, where the boundary diameter is used in the Nusselt number correlation. With this improved condensation model, the bulk subcooling temperature is shown to be the correct temperature difference for the condensation sink term.
The benchmark results calculated by two geometry-based semi-empirical correlations and three empirical correlations show: in the void fraction region of [0.005,0.25], TRACE (TRACE, 2010), and Zeitoun-Shoukri (Zeitoun and Shoukri, 1996) correlations provide good prediction; while in the void fraction region of [0.25,0.67], RELAP5 (Thermal Hydraulics Group, 1998) and Zeitoun et al. (1994) correlations give better estimations of ai than others.
The sensitivity analysis of the closure models for IATE in subcooled boiling flow is provided. The analysis of the bubble layer thickness model reveals that the model is necessary for subcooled boiling systems. Compared to the triangle bubble layer thickness model, the flat bubble layer thickness model is observed to be a more suitable choice over the range of conditions considered. In addition, the analysis of PNVG indicates that measured PNVG locations are necessary for the start point of IATE calculation and inaccuracies in the PNVG models will propagate in a transport-based approach for modeling interfacial area concentration.
The validation results show that the one-group IATE with the modified closure models has exceptional performance in the low void fraction region compared to the semi-empirical and empirical correlations. When the group-2 void fraction is less than 10%, the one-group IATE can predict the interfacial area concentration relatively accurately. On the contrary, in high void fraction flows, the accuracy of the one-group IATE is significantly lower, thus indicating the need for a multi-group approach.
